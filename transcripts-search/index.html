Mrs. Mary C. Terrell,
15o North Professor St.,
Oberlin, Ohio.

My dear Mrs. Terrell:
In reply to your note of a few 
days ago I can do little more than repeat
what I said in our conversation.

I think it is altogether possible
that I promised you that I would put in the
application for your daughters at Talcott
Hall.  I have already spoken to Mrs.
Lawrence  about that matter and I have not
forgotten that I promised that the year at
Tenney Cottage should not count as one of
their three years, but I am very certain
that I was not so unwise as to promise a
place at Talcott Hall for next year. My
experience has made me very certain that
such promises are unsafe as one never can
tell from one year to the next how long
an application may be necessary and I
take great pains always to avoid committing 
myself to what may be difficult of
accomplishment. Of course I do not mean
now to say that it is at all certain that
the girls cannot be there but simply that
we cannot give definite answer until the
appointments are made, probably in March.

Miss Anna Beatrice Doerschuk

Mrs. M.C.T.--2.

As to the other matter of making
some special concession to your daughters
and giving them places in advance of their
regular application I feel very confident
that I cannot do other than I have done
and insist upon entire impartiality as the
basis of all my decisions. I do not believe
we should be furthering at all the
cause of the colored people if it was felt
that they were given special favors. It
could scarcely fail to increase whatever
sensitiveness there already is on the part
of some of the white students.

I have asked Mrs. Robson to put
Mary's name on the list of applicants for
Baldwin Cottage.  To avoid any possible
misunderstanding I may as well tell you
frankly now that it is not at all probable
that she can [could] be received before her
Senior year. It has been many years since
it has been possible for us to receive
in the Junior year one whose name had not
been filed a considerable time before her
entrance to college.

I am exceedingly sorry if any of
this seems ungracious or inconsiderate but</pre>
