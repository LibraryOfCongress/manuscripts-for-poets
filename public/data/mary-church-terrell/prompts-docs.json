One of the \ngreatest hindrances to our progress is that, as a race, we do not think.  We\ntake it for granted that we think, but, if actions speak louder than\nwords, circumstantial evidence is against us.  The verdict of an impartial\njury must be that we do not think.  We are constantly doing and saying\nthings which militate most seriously and sadly against the progress of\nthe race.  Those of us who have had superior advantages of education are\nthe chief sinners in this respect.  Often I have heard men who were \ngraduates of Harvard, Yale and other great universities of similar standing\nin the presence of young people tell jokes about representative men and\nwomen and refer to characteristics of the race which could not help\nmaking them lose respect for it.  Some who occupy most conspicuous positions\nseem never quite so happy as when they tell stories which make Colored\npeple the butt of ridicule.  Anecdotes are related in which Colored people\nare represented as being cowards, for instance, so that the laugh is\nalways turned on them and we can not help feeling disgust and contempt for\nthem.\nA favorite joke is to represent a Colored man as claiming to\nbe very brave in his relations with white people.  \"Yes indeed,\" says the \nColored man in the joke, \"if that white man says or does this or that to\nme\", \"if dat white man says or does dis or dat to me, I'm jes goin to\nevermo knock his haid off\" or do something else as drastic.  And then the\njoker represents the white man as doing the very thing which the Colored\nman has bravely declared he would not stand for, but instead of carrying\nout his threat of putting the white man out of commission, the Colored ma[n]\ngoes all to pieces the moment he lays eyes on the Colored man and takes\nto his heels and skedaddles down the pike so fast that the wind could not\ncatch him.  You all know that type of story, you have heard it again and\nagain.  It is really very amusing.  It is so ridiculous that it is hard to\nsuppress a laugh, but it is a pity to persist in doing this kind of\n\n2\nthing, it does so much harm.  Here is a group of human beings at whom a\nwhole nation is constantly poking fun - whom everybody likes to make the\nbutt of ridicule.  The more ridiculous the colored man appears, the louder\nthe laugh is sure to be.  It is a great temptation for public speakers to\ntell such stories, or for those who want to entertain their friends at\nthe dinner table to relate such anecdotes, but this kind of thing\ncertainly belittles the race, causes everybody, members of the race included, to\nplace a low estimate upon it, lose respect for it and hold it in contempt.\nRecently influential and wealthy Jews have organized a society\nwhich they have named the Anti-Defamation Society.  As its name indicates\nthe object is to put a stop to the defamation of Jews in particular and\nall other slandered races on general principles, if the statement sent ou[t]\nby the organizers may be believed.  This will include, of course, the\nIrish, the Indian and the Colored man.  This Anti-Defamation Society \nintends to drive from the stage all the plays which misrepresent the Jews\nprotest against cartoons in newspapers which caricature the Jew and\nsuppress films in the moving picture shows which represent him to be\ndishonest or make him appear to be an undesirable or ridiculous citizen in\nany way, shape or form.  Let us hope this Anti-Defamation society will\nsucceed in its noble purpose.\nWhat a step in advance it would be for us as a race, if we could\ndrive from the stage all the plays and farces which make people with\nblack, or brown or yellow faces ridiculous.  How much would be done to \nremove from the eyes and the ears of the public the questionable, risque\nscenes, when they are not positively vulgar, and the disgusting sounds\nwhich cause everybody who witnesses them to hold the race in contempt.\nI am not lifting my voice against the productions which are merely funny.\nWe all need recreation.  Some of us do not have enough of it.  We take life\ntoo seriously altogether.  A hearty laugh is at once a medicine and a\ntonic.  But there is a vast difference between plays that are funny and those\nwhich are degrading both to the individual who witnesses them and the rac[e]\nwhich they cruelly misrepresent and caricature.", "2", 0, 0, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-023:00648", "7\nto be expended, too.  But it is a consummation much to be desired.  But,\nthere is one thing we can do, that it the talented, determined few may\nattempt to do.  It is always possible to move the hearts of men by stories\ncleverly, touchingly written for the purpose of exposing injustice and\ncreating sentiment in behalf of the injured and oppressed, when other\nforms of literature fail.  Abraham Lincoln said the Uncle Tom's Cabin\nwritten by the sainted Harriet Beecher Stowe brought on the Civil War,\nand I believe it did.

It is high time to \ntell the world that we are not willing to be shoved off into sections set \naside exclusively for colored people as there are places set apart for unfortunates \nafflicted with leprosy or small pox. It is time for us to tell \nthe world that we are not willing to live within the pale right here \nunder a Republican form of government in the capital of the nation as \nJews had to do under a monarchy for so many years.\nAs colored people we do not realize as much as we should that we should\n try to uphold the principles upon which this government was built. This is \na Republic. This is a Democracy. And it is just as much our duty as it is \nthat of any other racial group- perhpas it is more our duty - to see that\nthe principles of the Republic and this Democracy are mantainted here\nat the Capital at any cost.\nThe trouble with some of us is that we protest too much in secret and\nbehind closed doors and will not speak boldly right our in meeting in\ntones so loud and clear that they will riing around the whole civilized \nworld. Some of us are afraid to agitate in behalf of a good cause. We\nwould just as soon have somebody call us a horse thief as an agitator.\nBut why should we fear or be ashamed to agitate? All other oppressed \ngroups have agitated to secure their rights. Labor agitated for years in\nan effort to make a capital just. Women in this country and in England agitated\nfor years before they secured their rights as human beings.\nAnd believe me, brothers and sisters who sit in this John Wesley A.M.E.\nChurch this beautiful April afternoor in the year of our Lrd 1924, we\ncolored people will have to agitate too if we are to get anywhere or get\nanything in the United States.\nTo use the popular phrase again. it is our duty to tell the world that\nwe will not allow anybody to back us up into some dakr alley, or s hove\ns off in some far away corner or force up on some undesirable side street\n\n\n\n2\nwhich white people consider quite good enough for colored folks. We might\nas well make up our minds right here and now to state in no uncertain\nterms that when colored people start out to buy a home, they are going to\ndo the picking and the choosing for themselves.\nSome of us remind me of Dickens' laughable old Micawber. We sit placidly\nlooking out of our front window or we park ourselves on our back door\nsteps waiting patiently for somebody or something to turn up to do for\nus what we should do for ourselves.  . If there is one thing more necessary \nthan another that we should do for ourselves, it is to tell the world that\nthat we knew what are our rights as American citizens and by the Great\nHorned Spoon we intend to have our rights or know the reason why.\nWhat is Segregation anyhow? Like some other ugly evil, things with\npretty or high-sounding names. It is a word of four syllables which is \nnot at all harsh but sounds rather smooth to the ear. But Segregation is\nverything which should not be and we do not want. It is un-american, undemocratic,\nunchristian, unjust, unwise and let us see to it that we make it\nunable to thrive and grow in the capital of the United States.\nI am a victim of segregation.

When one thinks of the intelligence possessed\nby the colored people of this city and the large amount of money\nthey make, it is impossible to account for such a short-sighted - I had almost\nsaid suicidal policy as this which they now pursue. It is all the\nmore surprising that the colored people of Greater New York have shown\nsuch an inexplicable and painful lack of enterprise, and courage, because I\nam reliably informed that in the Borough of Brooklyn alone about $200,000 \nare spent by the race every year to rent halls for concerts, entertainments \nand mass meetings. I am also told that with a few possible exception \nthe places available for the use of colored people are not only unhandy\nand undesirable, but are poorly equipped as well.\n\nIn the city of New York, I am informed, practically the same condition\nobtains   Not one cent of the thousands of dollars paid by the people\nof New York for renting halls is returned to them in the shape of interest \nor dividends. Surely the progressive colored people of New York must feel\nashamed of this indifference to their own best interests. They can not \npossibly feel proud of their failure to provide for themselves that which\nvery intelligent person sees is so badly needed to day. As I have already\nsaid, not many of us here to night would care to undertake to build an auditorium\nourselves. And even if we were fired with zeal and the determination\nto fill this long felt want, we might not succeed, because we have\nnot had the training to do this particular kind of work. We are otherwise \nengaged, and we can not put into this enterprise, however worthy it may be\nthe time, the labor and the very heart's blood necessary to make it a success.\nBut if we can not be responsible for it and stand at the head of\nan enterprise, we can certainly help make it a success in a variety of\nways. We can speak a good word for it, for instance, whenever opportunity\nis afforded. We can talk to people about it in season and out and thereby advertise it in the most effective possible way. But move all we can take stock in it and then help place the Moorman-Harper Co. on a sound financial\nbasis. To use a form expression very common on the street- I lov e the interest\n\n\n\n6\n\nyou good people take in this company and I appreciate their kind\nwords, but oh ye7 dollars and centers. It seems unfortunate sometimes that\n money plays such a conspicuous role [part] in our life. But we may deplore the\nfact as loudly and as long as our lungs hold out, we can not alter\nor change these conditions which confront us. We must accept them and \nmake the best of them. We must have money. Without this root of all evil\nnothing can succeed. Let us see to it, therefore, that we encourage these\nwomen who have had the courage and the enterprise to undertake this prodigious \nenterprise. by supporting it not only with words but by giving it\ndollars and cents. The plans they made must appeal to all. They intend to\nerect a magnificent building which will contain a large auditorium with \nstage equipment adequate for the presentation of first class concerts, dramas\nand light operas. In this building which they intend to construct\nthere will also be a banquet hall, gymnasium and rooms in which classes\nmay be taught, lectures delivered and ledges meet. Nothing could be more\ndesirable and more complete than n this plan. This will be the first\nbuilding of its kind in New York to be owned by colored people. If the colored\npeople of Greater New York do not give this movement their hearty financial support,\nso as to insure success, it will be to their everlasting condemnatin\nand shame.\nEven if there were to be no financial returns to those who purchased\nshares of stock, many here to night would have little excuse for failing to so.\nNo people can hope to count for much in the world, neither can they hope \nto achieve anything worth while, if they are not willing to make sacrifice\nby going down into their pockets once in a while for the good of the race.\nWe can never accomplish much along any line, until we learn to make sacrifices. \nIn this case, however, we are not obliged to make a sacrifice,\nWwhen we take stock in the Moorman-Harper Co., we may be as sure as we\ncan be of anything in the world that we shall get returns for the money\ninvested.. Therefore, these who take stock in this company will not only\nplace upon a solid foundation an enterprise which will forever redound to \nthe credit of the race as a whole and will stand as a monument to the", "4", 6, 6, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-020:00758", "18\nwhole race with disrepute.

Please dont call me Mary,\" I pleaded. \"I am not accustomed to being called Mary by strangers.\"\n\"We'll see about that,\" she said angrily, \"I will get the superintendent and he'll attend to you.\"\nIn a few minutes a tall man appeared with fire in his eye. \"The nurse tells me that you have been making trouble in this ward,\" he began. \"What's the matter with you?\" \"I haven't been making any trouble,\" I explained. \"I am simply objecting to having the nurses call me by my Christian name. I want them to address me by my family name, as they do other self-respecting women.\"\n\"When the nurses call you by your first name,\" he said emphatically, \"they are simply obeying the instructions which they have received.\"\n\"But they dont call women of other races by their first names, no matter how ignorant or depraved they may be.\" \"Well,\" interrupted the Superintendent, \"there's a big different between white women and colored women.\"\n\"I wont be treated with disrespect and indignity simply because I am a colored woman.\" I replied. \"I was a member of the Board of Education in this city for eleven years and I have tried to promote the welfare of this city in every way I could and I wont allow anybody to humiliate me , because I am not white.\"\n\"I dont care who you are,\" countered the superintendent, \"I dont care if you were the President of the Board of Education, we are going to address you as we do all colored women by your first name.

For, by the time he had attended to the wants of the white passengers who were getting on or off the train it was too late for him to buy me any thing to eat. Consequently, when I reached my destination about ten o'clock that night, I had gone without food for more than twenty four hours. I had not had a meal since I had eaten my dinner about six o'clock the night before. After that I resolved never to enter the Jim Crow Car, if I had to travel all day.

Then I realized that I was caught like a rat in a trap, so to speak, and I resigned myself to my fate.\nJust as the train stopped at the station the conductor beckoned to a colored porter and said \"Take this lady's suit case to the H House.\" I was almost paralyzed with surprise and fear, but I dared not refuse to go. \nThe porter looked at me hard and I am sure he knew I was colored. By some it is claimed that southern white people can always detect a colored person, no matter how fair he or she may be. But that is a great mistake.

She was determined that whatever mistakes of judgent\nshe had made in the past, [she] sh[w]ould not be repeated in this particular case.\nToward the close [At the end] of the second day she saw a dress which [she liked] pleased her very much,\nShe drank in all its good points with an attention and an avidity of which \nfew women and no men would be capable. She noted whether the sleeves were \nlong or short, full or otherwise, [pras?] fixed firmly the shape of the collar in \nher mind, the waist and its trimming were indelibly outlined upon the tablet \nof her brain, the design of the embroidery and the color of the beads [*she*] could be \n[copied exactly as she felt sure] learned by heart and the skirt of the creation could be exactly \ncopied she felt sure. Mrs. Bilton was delighted. She tried the dress on and\n[*the saleswoman who morally certain that her prospect would purchase it assured \nher that the gown took off ten years at least and was the most becoming*]\nshe could not possibly find anything more becoming and made her look ten \nyears younger at least.\n\"Yes\", whispered Mrs. Bilton having a great sigh of relief as she left\nthat department [store]. I'll have my georgette crepe made just like that. She hurried to \nthe pattern counter [to find a pattern as near like it as she could. But it\ndawned upon her suddenly as she saw practically the same thing that it would]\n[That was good] What luck [indeed]. That was the aggravating thing about seeing a \nready made dress which one liked very much. It was seldon one could finda\npattern exactly like it,pif one wished to copy it at home not do at all for the dress which had pleased her so was made of heavy material\nand was wholly unsuitable for georgette crepe. [After she had] Mrs. B purchased\nit with glee, she stopped suddenly at the door as she was passing out. A disquieting \nthought shot through her brain. \"What an idiot, I am\", she exclaimed.\nI cannot possibly my make purdress like this pattern, for it is n ot\n\n\n4\nsuitable for georgette crepe. The dress   It dawned upon her with full force that the\ndress which had pleased her so much was satin. How unfortunate it was that\nshe had been tempted to buy georgette crepe at a bargain sale. Why couldn't she\nhave chanced upon a bargain in satin as well. No use grieving over spilt milk\nhowever, she couldn't throw the georgette crepe away. She must just begin her search all\nover again and if possible find a ready made georgette crepe dress. And truly the fates were with\nher. For she not only found a ready made georgette creation which pleased her in every\nparticular, but she found a pattern exactly like it as well. The more she studied the\npattern the more she rejoiced that she wd  Again what luck\nnot to be obliged to alter [the pattern] it at all - not to be forced to explain to Mrs.\nHewie that the sleeve must be changed this way or that- or that the collar\nof the dress after which she wished hers to be copied had a shape different \nfrom that of the pattern whereupon she wd have to, just like this- making a desperate effort at a description\nin which art Mrs. Bilton, alas did not shine at all.\nFew women in Bruns wick were happier than Mrs. Bilton when she safely deposited \nthat perfectly satisfactory pattern entirely suitable for georgette \ncrepe in her drawer of her new chifferobe that night.\nThe next step of course was to get the lining. Ah there was the rub.\nWhat should it be? Mrs. Bilton decided to go to the department stores with a\nsample of the georgette crepe and ask the clerks at the lining counter what she\nshould get. But, as doctors disagree, so do clerks in a department store.\nMrs. Bilton realized as she never did before that it was a case of many women, \nmany minds. That evening As she reviewed the various samples of materials and colors whcin\nshe had collected on her rounds which had not cut great chunks of time from her \ntrenuous day, she was bewildered ,indeed. If not the material of one sample pleased \nher, the color and shade thereof would not do was sure answer the purpose at all.\n[In spite of] After much careful thought and painful irresolution Mrs. Bilton finally\npurchased the sample selected with much misgiving. She had no sooner [had she] brought \nit home and put it under her georgette crepe, than she had a horrible suspicion \nthat the near silk lining chosen with such fear and trembling was of a purple \naltogether too bright.

If he sighed aloud unwittingly and he saw by the expression on [his] Helen's\nface that she had heard him, he looked grieved and ashamed of himself, as\nthough he had been detected in doing something wrong.  Helen racked her brain\ntrying to discover the cause of her husband's gloom, but she failed utterly\nto guess it.  Surely, she thought, he is not worried by financial troubles\nof any kind.  Guy Foster was one of the most popular, [hospicious?] if not the most popular\n[ysicians] doctor in the city, and he was making money hand over fist.  He had settled\nin Horton soon after he had graduated from one of the largest and finest \nmedical schools in the West, had taken the State Board examination and had\nsailed [right] into a lucrative practice right away.\n    There was every reason in the world, why he should have achieved such a [b] \nbrilliant success, for he had [everything in his favor] much to recommend him as a physician and a great\ndeal in his favor as a man.  He was handsome, tall, well-proportioned and possessed\npersonal magnetism which would have spelled success in any profession or\noccupation he chose.  With his olive complexion, his darkpbrown eyes, his\njetp-black hair he looked like a genuine Spanish Hidalgo son of Spain.\n\n[Everybody was interested in]  Guy Foster's courtship had created a great deal of interest in Horton aroused much comment for it was a a\nbecause it was considered a genuine case case of love at first sight. He had no sooner laid eyes on [Helen] Maria Bates and\n [whatever [that was] or if ever that maybe-] she had no sooner beheld him than the fate of each was sealed.  Helen had\ncome straight from an Eastern university as soon as she had graduated and\nbegan to teach in the Horton High School.  In type she was Guy Fostoer's\ndirect and distinct oppostie, for she was as fair as a lily, had dark-blue\neyes and a wealth of auburn hair.\nThat \" all the world loves a lover was forcibly illustrated in the case of \nGuy Foster and Helen Bates.  There was something fatherly or motherly, brotherly\nor sisterly in the interest[ed] manifested by the townspeople in this \nmuch-discussed love affair.  Neither one lived with his family. Both were\naway from home.  There was a  genuine satisfaction, therefore, on the part of\ntheir friends, when they received the announcement of the wedding of this\n\n[*2*] \ndeal young couple, as they were called by everybody in town\nThe first [two] 4 years of her marriage Mrs. Foster's life was a beautiful\ndream crystallized into a tangible, concrete reality, The doctor had practically\nfinished paying for a comfortable home, artistically furnished, owned\nan automobile and had prospered beyond the expectations of his fondest hopes.\nBut, now lately, a change had come over the young physician.  Try [as Helen]\nmight, she could not argue, coax or deceive herself into believing the\ncontrary.  Once she [had gone] went into his [private] office, when she knew all of the \npatients had gone, for a long time.  She had had waited [a long time for him to appear,] in the reception room so as to surprise him. so thi\n[they might] then motor home [together] with him [as was their custom.] When she went into his private office, She found him with\nhis face buried in his hands, so absorbed in his gloomy meditations that he did not\nhear her, when she opened and closed the door.  She placed her hand on his sho  \nshoulder to arouse him, and when he looked up at her, he was the picture of \nabject despair.  When she urged him to tell her what was troubling him, he implored \nher not to mke him more wretched then he was by [draw] trying, to drag from\nhim the cause of his gloom.\n     At first, when she had ventured to inquire concerning his melancholy,\nhe tried to make her believe that it was only her imagination which lead her\nto [believe] suspect that he had changed.  For a long time he insisted he was all right\nBut, after she had seen him so often, when he could not rally quickly at the \nsight of her and shake off the depression which had settled so heavily upon\nhim, he [did not deny] no longer tried to deny that he was unhappy. [he ceased to expect her to believe him.]  [could not pretend that he was all right--] [*begins could longer tried to deny that he was unhappy--*]\n Could Guy be tired of her, [she] Helen Foster asked herself, and was there another woman \nin the xase ? But she [?????????] put that out of her mind [immediately.]  She was ashamed \nto have such a disloyal thought [pass through her mind.] about her husband.  If ever a man were true \nto a woman, she assured herself, it was Guy Foster to herself. [In thinking of] Then she began to think about the conditions \nwhich might make her husband happier than he was.  She wished [they] she had a \nchild in their home.  But that is precisely what Guy had insisted from the \nfirst that he did not want. \"We'll be happy together, Helen, just you and I\" \nhe said.  It's a risk to have children- a terrible risk.

She thought of a joke which the Presidnet of the Monday Club had\ncracked at Guy Foster's expense. This was composed of the leading professional\nand business men of Horton who lunched together every Monday.\nAnd now said he we \"Guy is no[t] ancestor worshipper,\" he said. \"He certainly can not be said to\nresemble [those] the Irish potatoe, because the best part of him is underground.\n[Guy] He will never take you any further back into his dim and distant past than\nhis Freshman year.\" But everybody admired the young physician precisely\nfor his very modesty. Nobody doubted, to look at him, that he could talk\na great deal about the distinguished, wealthy family to which he belonged,\nif he were built on those lines/. One of his acquaintances who was considered\nan authority on such matters had shaken her head very impressively\nmore than once and declared [said] oracularly \"Say what you please, but that Guy Foster\nhas good blood in his veins. There's no doubt about that. He looks the part\nand acts it as well.\" But who in that Western town cared a rap about the\nyoung physicians parents or his ancestors?In no part of the United States is\nit easier for people without distinguished family connections to make good\nthan in the West. In that delectably democratic section of this country people are\naccepted for what they are themselves and can actually do and not because of a family [from which] tree which was grown in their back yards.\n\"Tell me plainly, Guy,\" [Helen implored] urged [him] one night, have you ceased to\nlove me? I can not stand to see you so evidently wretched without knowing\nthe cause. [It's more than I can stand.] I have tried not to notice it, but\nit has[d] gotten on my nerves now to such an extent that you must tell me what\nis the matter with you or I simply can not exist.\n\"I beg of you Helen,\" he implored. Don't try to ascertain why I am so unhappy\nIt is something which you yourself can not help. I love you more to day, dear\nthan I ever loved you before. Believe me, I beg of you. Some day when I am stronger I may reveal\n\n\n\n4\nreveal to you the reason why I seem to you to have changed, but I can not do \nso now. It would be unkind to you. In a way it would be species of cowardice \non my part to drag you into the mire of misery just because I am depressed \nmyself. Trust me that I am doing the best and wisest thing for both of us \nby keeping my secret to myself. \"\nGuy, have you [done anything criminal] committed any crime or have you done [or have] anything of which \nyou are shamed? Helen could not desist from trying to discover the cause \nof her husband's unhappiness, try as hard as she could. Any[thing], certainty, no matter how horrible or disgraceful it was, would be better than the uncertainty which \nwas driving her mad.\nBelieve me, Helen, he [replied] assured her, \"I have done nothing[and I am not\nreposnsible] committed no crime. If I have \nwronged anybody on earth, it is you, my beloved wife. If you are satisfied with me\nBut she [with me] threw her arms around him affectionately and would not let him say\nanother word.

She had drawn\nhis head on her shoulder and was covering his face with kisses.\nThat day Guy Foster extracted a promise from his wife that she would question\nhim no more, because he promised her definitely that if she insisted\nupon it, he would tell her on the anniversary of their marriage the secret of his unhappiness provided\nshe were willing to take the consequences.\n[Helen] Something was also weighing heavily on Helen's mind.\n[Although] [Helen had not asked the question directly, she] She would\nnot even let it shape its unwelcome, unspeakable self into anything so definite\nas thought.

There was no doubt\nabout that. Why did he not come to see him in the open. Why did her husband \nnot introduce his father to her?

Marcia asked herself again and again.  Was\nthere another woman in the case?  But she invariably put such a solution out\nof her mind.  She was ashamed to a such a disloyal thought about her husband.  \nIf ever a man were true to a woman, she assured herself, it was Guy\nFoster to his wife.  Then she began to think of conditions which might make\nher husband happier than he was.  She wished she had had a baby.  Perhaps Guy\nwas grieving about that.  But that was precisely what her husband had said\nhe did not want.\n\"We'll be happy together, Marcia, just you and I,\" he said. \"It's a \nrisk to have children-a terrible risk.

This was composed\nof the leading professional and business men who lunched together every\nMonday.\n\"And now,\"  said he, when he was toast-master at a banquet one night,\n\"we come to Dr. Guy Foster, one of the leading physicians of Horton.  He has\ntraveled so much, he's a little uncertain where he hails from.  We know he\nwas born somewhere in the East.  But he's different from some fellow who migrate \nfrom that part of our moral vineyard out here.  He isn't always talking \nabout his distinguished family in the East - how much they know and how \nmuch they are worth.  Our friend is no ancester worshipper - not on your life.\n\n4\nA miracle of modesty is our Guy. He believes in doing things himself. He certainly\ndoes not resemble the irish potatoe, because the best part of him\nis underground. Stand up now, and speak for yourself, Guy.\nShe recalled too that one of his friends had said in a joke, \"Guy will\nnever take you any further back into his dim and distant past than his\nFreshman year.\"\nBut everybody admired the young physician precisely for his modesty.\nNobody doubted that he could talk a great deal about his distinguished,\nwealthy family, if he were built on those lines. He looked the part.\nOne of his acquaintances who was considered an authority on such matters\nhad shaken her head very impressively and declared oracularly, \"Say what\nyou please, but that Guy Foster has good blood in his veins. There's no\ndoubt about that.\" And then she would elaborate on that very much as one\ndoes when he talks about the \"points\" of a highly-bred dog.\nBut who in that Western town cared a fig about the young physician's\nparents or his ancestors? In no part of the United States is it easier\nfor people without distinguished family connections to make good than in the\nWest.

At least fifteen of the most advanced nations in the world have signed a treaty which pledges them to renounce war and settle their disputes like[d] people who claim to be civilized instead of like barbarians. What an impressive sight it must have been as the representatives of fifteen nations took a pen in their hands and signed their names to that historic document. And first of all came the representative of that nation which most people accuse of starting the war. But, if war was really started by Germany, it was not the nation itself which was guilty of bring on that unspeakable horror, it was the Kaiser who had built up a military machine with which he felt certain he could conquer the world. It was probably the most wonderful and presumably efficient aggregation of fighting material which the eye of man had ever beheld. As a young woman I was awed by it, as the diffierent units used to go through their maneuvers near Berlin, or pass that beautiful city itself. \nIt [?] only ten minutes for the representatives of Germany, the United State, France, Belgium, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,, South Africca, (Irish Free State, India, Italy, Japan, Poland and Czechoslovakia to affix their signatures to the agreement among these nations to renounce war as an instrument of national policy. White men signed this Briand, Kellogg pact for the following four countries which did not originally belong to this division of the human family, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India. Great Britain has stolen all these countries from dark people. It is a terrible injustice, and some day this awful wrong will be righted without a doubt. Since fifteen nations have agreed to settle their disputes and differences without resorting to that wholesale slaughter of human beings long sanctioned by civilized nations under the name of war, there is a reason to hope that some day when all the countries in the world enter this pact of peace, they will decide to restore to their rightful owners the tracts which have been stole from them. It requires no greater faith in human nature to believe this will happen in the future, than it required just a few years ago to believe that \n\n2\nfifteen of the largest and most advanced nations in the world would [have] pledged themselves to resort to war no more. \nA note has been addressed to 48 other nations inviting them to sign this agreement which Monsieur Briand for France and Mr. Kellogg our secretary of State have drafted and sponsored. The only nation which has been inored is Russia, and there is reason to believe that the country over which the great white Czar once ruled will be invited after while. \nAmong the countries to which invitations have been sent are four in which dark-skinned people live- Ethiopia, Egypt, Haiti, Brazil, Liberia, Mexico, Nicaragua, China, Cuba, Siam and the Dominican Republic. \nBut, alas, something remains to be done in this country, before we can be sure that this peace pact which has just been signed in Paris will receive support here which it deserves. It has to be ratified bu the United States Senate. Surely the Senators will not reject such an effort to save mankind from the scourge of war as this treaty offers. If they do, it will be an unspeakable calamity. Neither Great Britain nor France will ratify it till the United States Senate approves it.

But ever since the Indian Citizenship Act was signed by President Coolidge on June 2, 1924, the copper-colored beneficiaries thereof have been cultivated by the politicians more and more assiduously. And now, if you please, we are being told in some of the States, that the Indian actually holds the balance of power. Oklahoma has the greatest Indian population with more than 120,000 red men to its credit- nearly three times as many as can be found in any other State.

A well to do white woman from a distinguished family has just bequeathed her some valuable property in that cit where our friend Jim Crow rules the roost, as a general rule.

She probably brought her little daughter to the house where she was working, or she may have lived there, the story does not enlighten us on that point.

A report which was signed by\nseveral Bishops and renowned physicians was presented to the general\nconvention which has recently met in Washington. \"Christian healing,\" says this\nreport,\"has passed beyond the stage of experiment and its value can not be\nquestioned.\" Among the physicians who signed this remarkable report was none\nother than the great Charles Mayo, one of the two brothers who established\nthe famous Mayuo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and who is said to have been\nthe first surgeon to demonstrate that goitres can be successfully removed.\nFor many years physicians expressed doubt that human beings could be\ncured of their various physical ailments by faith in Religion or by any influence\nwhich their minds alone could exert upon their bodies. Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy\nthe founder of Christian Science, claimed that remarkable cures had been\nwrought by the faith which those who belonged to her church reposed in the\nmethods of healing which she recommended in her religion. Personally,\nit was always hard for me to believe many of the remarkable stories which I have\nheard about the cures which opeople have told me could be ascribed to nothing\nbut faith in an unseen power to heal. Try as hard as I might, I could not\ngtasp it.\nI was once the guest of a woman in Horner, New York who told me an astounding\nexperience which she herself had had a short while before sheentertained\nme. The day before she was to read an address to her club about her\ntravels abroad, she said, she fell and broke her shoulder blade. She did not\ncall a physician at the time and never had done so, she declared. And the da\nday after the accident she appeared before her club and filled her engagement\nas though nothing had happened. There was no doubt whatever she hhad\nbroken her shoulder blade, she said, for a physician to whom the accident was\ndescribed had told her friends that this had assuredly occurred. Although\nit was hard for me to believe my hostess, I dared not do otherwise, for she\nwas a woman of the highest integrity. Moreover, her friends assured me that\nthey know what she stated was a fact.\n\nNow that the bishops and other dignitaries of the Protestant Episcopal\nChurch in convention assembled\n\n\n\n2\nassembled have declared that \"such healing is an experience of mankind that can no longer be\nquestioned,\" those o us who have been \"Doubting Thomases\" should investigate the subject more\nthoroughly than we have ever done before. We live to learn. It is foolish to close her minds\nagainst new truths of any kind. \"Throughout the world,\" says the report which was signed by\nsome of the most distinguished churchmen and physicians in the United States,\"spiritual healing\nno longer is the hope of a few, but the belief and practice of a large and rapidly increasing\n[number] number of persons.\" The belief was expressed,however, that all faith healing should be carried\non in close cooperation with medical science and practice. This will not be concurred in\nby the dyed-in-the wool Cgristian Scientist and others who believe that if one has faith\nenough, neither doctors nor medicine will be necessary to effect a cure. To make the report\nmost emphatic the learned men who signed it commended to the church such efforts as are being\nmade by trained men and women under sanction of Episcopal authority to awaken men to the trut\ntruth of spiritiual healing.\" Mary Baker Eddy did not live in vain. The truths she tried\nto enunciate seem to be marching boldly and rapidly on, even if some of us cannot grasp them\nas well as we should like. At any rate, what she was being ridiculed by the wise as well as t\nthe foolish but a few years ago. no one would have dared to predict that such a conservative\nbody as the Protestant Episcopal Church in connunction with famous surgeons would urge\nailing human beings to practice the methods of healing in which she so strongly believed.\nWhile Mrs. Eddy would have rejoiced at the rapidity with which her d\ndoctrines are being received by the great men of the earth, neverthele\nless her heart would be [have been] saddened at the dissensions which have\narisen in her church.

This murder was\none of the most brutal ever committed in the State, and the horrible\ntortures of which the three innocent negroes were subjected indicated\nplainly that the mob intended the punishment to fit the crime. At\none time, three negroes, a mother, her daughter and her son, were lynched\nin Carrollton, Miss., because it was rumored that they had heard of\na murder before it was committed, and had not reported it. A negro\nwas accused of murdering a woman, and was lynched in Shreveport,\nLouisiana, on another occasion who was after ward proved innocent.\nThe woman who was lynched in Mississippi shortly after, was not even\naccused of a crime. The charge of murder had not been proved against\nher husband, and, as the white man who was murdered had engaged in\nan altercation with him, it is quite likely, if the negro had\nbeen tried in a court of law, it would have been shown to be a case\nof justifiable homicide. And so other cases might easily be cited\nto prove that the charge that innocent negroes are sometimes lynched\nis by no means without foundation. It is not strange, therefore,\nthat even reputable, law-abiding negroes should protest against the\ntortures and cruelties inflicted by mobs which wreak vengeance upon\nthe guilty and innocent and upon the just and unjust of their race\nalike. It is to the credit and not to the shame of the negro that\nhe tries to uphold the sacred majesty of the law, which is so trailed\nin the dust and trampled under foot by white mobs.\n\nIn the fourth place, it is well to remember, in discussing the\nsubject of lynching, that it is not always possible to ascertain the\nfacts from the accounts in the newspapers. The facts are often\nsuppressed, intentionally or unintentionally, or distorted by the\npress. The case of Sam Hose, to which reference has so often been\nmade, is a good illustration of the unreliability of the press\nin reporting the lunching of negroes. Sam Hose, a negro, murdered\nAlfred Cranford, a white man, in a dispute over wages which the\nwhite employer refused to pay the colored workman. It was decided\nto make an example of a negro who dared to kill a white man. A\nwell-known, influential newspaper immediately offered a reward of\n$500. for the capture of Sam Hose. This same newspaper predicted a\nlynching and stated that, though several modes of punishment had\nbeen suggested, it was the consensus of opinion that the negro should\nbe burned at the stake and tortured before being burned. A rumor was\nstarted, and circulated for and wife by the press, that Sam Hose had\nassaulted the wife of Alfred Cranford, after the latter had been\nkilled. One of the best detectives in Chicago was sent to Atlanta to\ninvestigate the affair. After securing all the information it was\npossible to obtain from black and white alike, and carefully weighing\nthe evidence, this white detective declared it would have been a\nphysical impossibility for the negro to assault the murdered man's\nwife, and expressed it as his opinion that the charge of assault was\nan invention intended to make the burning a certainty.\n\nThe Sunday on which Sam Hose was burned was converted into a\nholiday. Special trains were made up to take the Christian people\nof Atlanta to the scene of the burning, a short distance from the\ncity. After the first train moved out with every inch of available\n\n(6)\n\nspace inside and out filled to overflowing, a second had to be made up,\nso as to accommodate those who had just come fromchurch. After Sam\nHose had been tortured and burned to death, the great concourse of\nChristians who had witnessed the tragedy scraped for hours among his\nashes in the hope of finding a sufficient number of his bones to take\nto their friends as souvenirs. The charge has been made that Sam\nHose boasted to another negro that he intended to assault Alfred\nCranford's wife. It could be difficult for anybody who understands\nconditions in the South to believe that a sane negro would announce\nhis purpose to violate a white woman there, then deliverately enter\nher husband's house, while all the family were present, to carry out\nhis threat.\n\nTo years ago a riot occurred in Atlanta, Georgia, in which four\nwhite policemen were killed and several wounded by a colored man\nnamed Richardson, who was himself finally burned to death. Through\nthe press the public was informed that the negro was a desperado.\nAs a matter of fact, Richardson was a merchant, well to do and law abiding. \nThe head and front of his offending was that he dared to\nreprimand an ex-policeman for living in open adultery with a colored\nwoman. When it was learned that this negro had been so imprudent\nto a white man, the sheriff led out a posse, consisting of the city\npolice, to arrent Richardson. Seeing the large number of officers\nsurrounding his house, and knowing what would be his fate, if caught,\nthe negro determined to sell his life dear, and he did. With the\nexception of the Macon \"Telegraph,\" but few white newspapers ever\ngave the real cause of the riot, and so Richardson has gone down to\nhistory as a black desperado, who shot to death four officers of the\nlaw and wounded as many more. Several years ago near New Orleans,\na negro was at work in a corn-field. In working through the corn\nhe made considerable noise, which frightened a young white woman,\nwho happened to be passing by. She ran to the nearest house,\nand reported that a negro had jumped at her. A large crowd of white\nmen immediately shouldered guns and seized the negro, who had no\nidea what it meant. When told why he was taken, the negro protested\nthat he had not even seen the girl who he was accused of frightening,\nbut his protest was of no avail and he was hanged to the nearest tree.\nThe press informed the country that this negro was lynched for attempted\nrape. Instance after instance might be cited to prove that facts\nbearing upon lynching, as well as upon other phases of the race\nproblem, are often garbled---without intention, perhaps---by the press.\n\nWhat, then, is the cause of lynching? At the last analysis, it\nwill be discovered that there are just two causes of lynching. In\nthe first place, it is due to race hatred, the hatred of a stronger\npeople toward a weaker who were once held as slaves. In the second\nplace, it is due to the lawlessness so prevalent in the section\nwhere nine-tenths of the lynchings occur. View the question of\nlynching from any point of view one may, and it is evident that it\nis just as impossible for the negroes of this country to prevent\nmob violence by any attitude of mind which they may assume, or any\ncourse of conduct which they may pursue, as it is for a straw dam\nto stop Niagara's flow. Upon the same spirit of intolerance and of\nhatred the crime of lynching must be fastened as that which called\ninto being the Ku-Klux Clan, and which has prompted more recent\nexhibitions of hostility toward the negro, such as the disgranchisement\nacts, the Jim Crow Car Laws, and the new slavery called \"peonage.\"", "4", 14, 14, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-022:00054", "CONSOLIDATED GAS ELECTRIC LIGHT & POWER CO.\nOF BALTIMORE\n\nELECTRIC RANGE DEPT.

For an hour he was unloaded he had been sobbing\naloud as though he had lost his last friend. For a year he had gone about a\nlarge house as he pleased and had been treated as a member of the family and\nhe could not understand why he was confined in a box. When the box was opened\nhe saw the man who captured him on the West Coast of Africa more than a year ago, but it was the man\nwith whom he had lived, who had treated him kindly and whom he loved.\nN'gi sprang out of the box, threw his long arms around Mr. Buck's neck and\nkissed him over and over again as a child would do who had just been reunited\nwith a father from whom he had been separated a long time. In fact N'gi\nbehaves exactly like a small boy. When Mr. Buck stroked his black fur the\nthe poor, little human-animal was pacified, although the traces of his grief\nby no means disappeared. They are distinctly to be seen in the photo which\nwas taken of him hugged close in his former owner's arms. It is a question\nwhether N'gi will live, for gorillas rarely live in captivity more than a year.\nIt is said that a baby gorilla gets aong fairly well, so long as he has the\nconstant companionship of a human being whom he loves. But if this human friend\nleaves him for any length of time the animal becomes despondent, develops tuberculosis\nand finally dies of a broken heart. N'gi has never been allowed to\nbecome attached to any particular human being but he has been trained to\ntreat all men and women as his friends. The most that can be hoped for N'gi is\nthat he will transfer his affection to the attendants at our zoo. If this happens\nhe may live for years, but if he grieves for the home and the friends from which he has\njust been taken, he will soon die. For a long time a guard will be kept at his\ncage night and day and will never leave him. If N'gi should wake in the night\nand find himself alone he would [probably injure himself ifthat] he might\ninjure himself or he might even commit suicide. Although the little gorilla\nhas been placed in a cage with an orang-outang and two apes Mr. Buck says N'gi\nwill get very little pleasure out of their companionship, for he considers\nhimself a man and looks down upon the others as animals. He will play with\nthem as a boy would play with monkeys, but N'gi does not consider them his\nequals by any means. The little gorilla's plight is really pathetic. How can\none help pitying him? He has too much human intelligence to be an animal.\nIf there must be zoos, if animals must be rorn from their native habitat,\nfor goodness sake lets stop confining them in cages. The least we can do is\nto adopt a system now used in comparitively few zoos which has everything\nto recommend it. Animals are placed in surroundings as near like their native\nhabitat as possible and allowed to walk about without being confined all thei\nlives in cages. Why do we have zoos anyhow?

Not the least of these is the progress of the women in\neverything which makes for the culture of the individual and the elevation\nof the race.\n\n      From the moment colored women's fetters were broken and their\nminds released from the darkness of ignorance in which [it] they had been\nheld for nearly three hundred years; from the moment they could\nstand erect in the dignity of womanhood, no longer bond but free\ntill to day, they have forged steadily ahead in the acquisition of\nknowledge and in the cultivation of those graces of character which \nmake for good.

After he had paid\nhis tuition at Simpson College, Ia. and bought his books, he had only\n10 cents left.  Half of this sum was invested in corn meal and half in \nsuet, upon which he feasted for a whole week.\n          The boys had to have clean clothes and they soon discovered that\nthe colored student could to them up to a T., so they cheerfully turn-\ned their laundry work over to him.

Washington appear on the scene, discovered this\ngenius and spirited him away to his own institution in Alabama, where\nDr. Carver has remained ever since.  Even when the great Thomas Edison\noffered the Tuskegee teacher the princely sum of $100,000 to work for\nfive years in his laboratory at Orange, N.J., Mr. Carver declined this\nalluring invitation.  This is the way Dr. Carver explains the reason he\ndecided to reject Mr. Edison's offer:  \"You see, Mr. Washington put me\nhere nearly thirty years ago and said 'Let down your bucket where you\nare'.  I did as I was told and my bucket has always come up brimful and\nrunning over.  Mr. Washington is not with us in person any more and I\ncould not be faithless to his trust; now could I?\"\n             Reference has already been made to the flour which the Tuskegee\nwizard has manufactured from the sweet potato which is first cousin to the morn-\ning glory.  But flour from the sweet potato is only a drop in the buck-\net, so to speak.  One may smack his lips over a dish of delicious pud-\nding made from the tapioca into which the sweet potato has been convert-\ned by this master chemist.  The crystalized ginger and the breakfast \nfood which come from the sweet potato are highly recommended by those \n\n                                                        6\nwho have sampled them.\n              It does not require a great stretch of the imagination for those\nof us who like sweet potatoes to believe that things good to eat can\nbe made out of them.  But when Professor Carver shows you a piece of\nrubber and tells you that it was produced from a delicious yam, it\nreally strains your credulity and puts your faith in his veracity to an awful\ntest.  Up to date 120 products have been created from the sweet pota-\nto and still there is more to follow.\n        Then too, there are wonderful dyes and paints which Prof Carver\nhas made out of common Alabama clay.  The Egyptians must have used the\ndyes found in clay, he says, and those who know declare they are the same\nbright, soft colors found in King Tut's tomb.  As you look at\nthe blues, reds and yellows in Prof Carver's laboratory, it is very\neasy to believe that he has rediscovered that art lost for so many \nyears which produced colors that have remained beautiful and unfaded\nfor 30 centuries.\n              And right here attention must be called to the fact that Dr. Car-\nver has done something which a noted German scientist who recently\nvisited this country declared could not be done.  As Dr. Carver was \nshowing my daughter and myself through his laboratory a short while\nago he pointed out a curious dark blue mass of something in a huge\nglass jar.  With a stick he stirred it up and explained that the pro-\nduct which we saw was the result of what is called fractional oxida-\nion.  At present Chemistry does not recognize such operations, he ex-\nplained and he declared that the German professor had every reason to \nfeel skeptical.  After the foreigner had looked carefully at Dr. Car-\nver's dark blue mass in the glass jar, he simply shook his head and\nsaid it was the strangest product he had ever seen.  But there it is \nto speak for itself.  \"So many new things are being discussed along\nall lines,\" said Dr. Carver, \"it is not at all surprising that Chem-\nistray can furnish its quota.\"\n\n\n", "4", 22, 22, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-023:00763", "7\nbroad-minded man.

I wash to cast no reflection \nwhatsoever upon trades unions on general principles, nor upon the American \nFederation of Labor in particular. And even if I did, I fancy they \nwould managed to jog along pretty comfortably just the same. I believe \nthat the organization of the labor is absolutely necessary, that labor organizations \n\n\n5\norganizations have already done a great deal of good. They have a mission which \nthey can and will, I believe, gloriously fulfill. But all institutions \nconceived by the human brain and governed by human law have their vices \nand defects. And the American Federation of Labor is not exception to this \ngeneral rule. It is absolutely necessary to mention the almost insurmountable \ndifficulties which confront Colored men along industrial lines, in \norder to place a correct estimate upon the success he has achieved. \nThere are many white people who have the Colored man's welfare deeply \nat heart and there are many Colored people themselves who are thoroughly disheartened, because Colored people do not progress industrially as rapidly \nas they should. Those who take this view should be reminded that the \nColored man's progress as a factor in the industrial world will not seem [must necessarily be slow] so slow, but will appear very creditable indeed, if they will but take \ninto consideration the obstacles of various kinds against which he is \nobliged to contend.\nAfter all, the Colored-American is not getting to Heaven on flowery \nbeds of ease. While he fights to win the prize, he literally has to sail \nthru bloody seas. On the one hand he is jarred hard and thumped severely \non the head, when he shows a disposition to acquire knowledge and cultivate \nhis brain. Then he is told that he is getting to big for his buttons \nand is galloping away beyond his sphere. On the other hand, after \nhe has mastered a trade and tries to source employment he is often coldly \nturned away on the ground that a Colored man has no right to compete \nindustrially with a white man.\nSome time ago a man known more or less favorably in national political \nlife went raging up and down the country like an infuriated animal simply \ntearing passion to tatters as he thundered against what he called the \nwicked and asinine policy of certain millionaire philanthropists, who \nfound and maintain schools, in which black men are taught the trades. \nTeaching a Negro to be a skilled laborer, he declared, is simply taking", "5", 21, 21, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-022:00113", "9\nthe subjects he presents. Especially do the farmers hear him gladly. His\nmessage to them is filled with information, inspiration and hope for those \nwho will only use their brain and brawn upon the things which the Creator\nhas placed within their reach.\n     Wherever he goes he emphasizes the fact that \"science, not the [tarif]\ntariff must find the solution for the South's agricultural problems.\" \"One\nmillion dollars applied to chemical study of our agriculture,\" he says, \"will\ndo more for it ultimately than the $500,000,000 fund set aside by Congress\nto attempt to alleviate some of the ills from which it is now suffering.\"\n     Dr. Carver has offered some very pointed suggestions concerning\nwheat. \"The laboratory, rather than the Liverpool market or the Chicago\nBoard of Trade, will solve the wheat problem\", he says, \"and insure the farmer\na fair price for his products.

Its possibilities are limitless.\"\n\"You can do it,\" declares the man who has made 200 or more articles from the\npeanut.\" You have your laboratories in your industrial institutions, in your\nschools, colleges and universities.\" He believes that young folks studying\nchemistry to day may be the saviors of the wheat situation tomorrow, and\nthat the problem of surplus crops may be solved scientifically by the South.\n     Somebody (Prof Carver has no idea who it was) proposed him for memship \nin the Royal Society of Great Britain because he has made so many remarkable\nchemical discoveries, and he now enjoys fellowship in it- an honor which has \nbeen conferred upon few Americans.\n     During the World War the government recognized his genius by drafting \nhim for investigational work in the Washington Laboratories. Among other\nthings he entered upon a study of dye stuffs, formerly imported from Germany,\nand of which the country was in dire need, and he is given credit for having\nduplicated more of these dye stuffs than all of the other scientists engaged \nin the work.\n     In addition to being a chemist and an agriculturist, The Tuskegee\n\n\n\n\n10\nwizard is a musician of distinction and James Wilson, once Secretary of Agriculture, declared that \"Prof Carver is probably the finest painter in the\nState of Iowa.\"\n     Few men have been called more names by the press of the country in\nreporting his speeches and describing his work than the colored scientist.\n\"The Columbus of the Soil, the Wizard of Organized Chemistry, the Man of the\nHour, the Hope of the South, the Discoverer of the Peanut and the Sweet Potato\"\nare some of the titles which have been bestowed upon him.\n     The modest simplicity [of the man] that marks Dr. Carver's genius endears him to\nall who meet him and he numbers among his friends some of the most distinguished \nand influential men of modern times.

But it is worth while to make the effort, whether actual tangible\nresults be achieved in our life time or not. Certainly it is the height\nof folly and the quintessence of short-sightedness for thoughtful, well\neducated Colored men and women to sit lazily and supinely by without lifting\na finger in an effort to stay the current of slander, misrepresentation\nand abuse so often heaped upon us by the magazines and daily press.\n     Even if the editors who receive letters of respectful, earnest\nprotest are not moved by them to the extent of withholding from their\ncolumns all the articles to which we have a right to object, they will\ncertainly have more respect for the race whose representatives are intelligent\nenough to realize the injury inflicted upon them, and are vigilant,\nactive and courageous enough to file a protest with those who\nare dealing the blows.\n     And so to night I have come to urge the women of this organization to\npledge themselves to write letters of protest to the editors of every newspaper\nor magazine in which a scurrilous article about the race appears.\nIt will at least be tangible proof of the fact that we know when we are\nbeing foully dealt with, that we resent such a treatment with all the intensity\nand earnestness at our command. Then let us leave the result of\nsuch efforts in the hands of Almighty God. Only let us see to it that\nwe do our part to mould public opinion in our favor, so far as in us\nlies.\n     To be sure a great amount of care must be exercised in expressing indignation\nor voicing a protest. It is quite possible earnestly to object\nto slander and abuse, and yet be respectful and dignified at one and the\nsame time. And that is exactly the way in which this matter must be done.\nSo convinced am I, however, that it is the duty of the intelligent women\nof this and every other community to do everything in their power to\n                                                   6\ninfluence editors who open their columns to deliberate distortion of\nfacts relating to the race that I am inclined to believe that even an impolitic\nletter of protest, a letter which contains a few mistakes of one\nkind or another, is better than no letter of protest at all.\n     Unlike our traducers and foes who years ago realized that in order\nto mould public opinion to their point of view they must place their\nbest young men on the large dailies of the North, we have not the power\nand influence to place our brainiest young people on the staff of the\ndaily or monthly press anywhere in the United States. Altho some of the\nColored newspapers present our point of view exceedingly well, they are\nread by comparatively few white people to day. Consequently we must use\nthe only weapon at out command to accomplish certain results. Shall\n     Shall we withdraw our subscriptions from a newspaper, when it\ncontains articles derogatory to the race, is a question which might naturally\nbe asked? Very little good would be done, if only one or two\nshould withdraw their subscriptions, it seems to me. But if fifty or one\nhundred of us should agree to withdraw our subscriptions and all write\nletters at the same time, stating our reasons for so doing, much good\nwould undoubtedly be accomplished. Again, some may raise the point that\nwhile we read the daily papers, comparatively few of us subscribe to\nthem. Consequently we are not in a position to withdraw subscriptions\non a scale large enough to do any good. Even if that be true, a letter of\nprotest, or better still, many letters of protest would have a great deal of weight.\n     Anything which proves that Colored people are intelligent enough to\nknow when they are being foully dealt with, are vigilant enough to watch\nfor articles which injure them and are loyal enough to use every means at\ntheir command to put an end to it helps to elevate the race in the opinion\nof everybody, but particularly among those who place a very low estimate\nupon us indeed.\n\n\n \n ", "4", 26, 26, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-022:00071", "5\nand running over. Mr. Washington is not with us in person any more, \nand I could not be faithless to his trust: now, could I?\"\nProfessor Carver's contribution to the knowledge of the world does \nnot consist alone in creating valuable products from undreamed of sources, \nbut in exposing popular errors every now and then. For instance, if \nyou have always believed the sweet potato is really a potato, you are \nwrong. It is a morning glory, that is, it belongs to the morning glory \nfamily. If you make a conundrum, therefore, and ask \"When is a potato not a potato?\" \n[therefore], the answer is, when it is sweet.\nAlthough many of us have been enjoying the delicious vegetable \nfor years, whether it was baked, candied or made into a pie, nobody \never dreamed of classifying it with the morning glory, until Professor \nCarver discovered they were kinfolks- cousins, perhaps. Reference has \nbeen already made to the flour which the [Professor] wizard has manufactured \nfrom the sweet potato and which served this country so well in our \nextremity during the World War. But flour from the sweet potato is \nonly a drop in the bucket, so to speak. One may smack his lips over a \ndish of delicious pudding made from the tapioca into which the sweet [p]\npotato has been converted by this master chemist. The crystalized ginger \nand the breakfast food which come from the sweet potato are highly \nrecommended by those who have sampled them. The cattle certainly enjoy \na food made from the sweet potato for them.\nIt does not require a great stretch of the imagination for those \nof us who like sweet potatoes to believe that things good to eat can \nbe made out of them. But when Professor Carver shows you a piece of \nrubber and tells you it was produced from that [veg] relative to the morning \nglory it really strains your credulity [imagination] to the breaking point. \nNothing but an unfaltering trust and a blind faith in the man himself \ncan enable you to accept as a fact such an unthinkable transformation as that. \nUp to date more than 118 products have been created from the sweet potato \nand still there is more to follow.\n\n6\nThen, too, there are wonderful dyes and paints which Professor \nCarver has made out of common Alabama clay. The Egyptian must \nhave used the [these] dyes found in clay, he says and those who know \ndeclare they are the same bright, soft colors found in King Tut's \ntomb. As you look at the blues, reds and yellows in Professor Carver's \nlaboratory, it is very easy to believe that he has rediscovered \nthat art lost for so many years which produced colors that have remained \nbeautiful and unfaded for thirty centuries.\nIf you should visit a little Episcopal church in Montgomery, \nAlabama, not many miles from Tuskegee,you would observe that the colors \nused in decorating it are just as permanent to day as they were \ntwenty years ago . And these colors were made from Alabama clay. \nFrom some ordinary weeds common to the State which cumber the \nground everywhere Professor Carver has made paper of various grades. \nExperts declare that some of it which comes from cotton stalks and \nfrom the Palmetto which is ubiquitous in Florida might well be used \nas cloth.\nIt would be hard to find a human being more modest and unassuming \nthan is this genius of ebony hue. If Professor Carver has any Cau-casian \nblood in his veins, it is certainly not apparent to the naked \neye. While he does not enjoy expatiating on his deeds of prowess , \nhe is quite willing to explain and cheerfully answers all questions \nput to him with great patience.\nHe will tell you, if you ask him, \"I believe the biggest \ncontribution my work will make is that of education.\"And one can easily \nagree with his own estimate of his efforts in that field. He has \nnot only instructed and inspired the youth of his own race, but he \nhas enlightened and delighted the white youth of the South.

Very truly yours,\n     Even if such letters apparently make no impression upon the editor\nand similar articles do appear in the future, at least the members of\nthe C.W.C.A will have done their duty. Some people refrain from doing\nwhat they know to be their duty excusing themselves on the ground that\ntheir efforts in a certain direction will do no good. But nobody can\nmake any such a prediction with certainty.

In reviewing the conditions which\nconfront us to day, taking into account the powerful forces at work\nagainst us and our inability successfully to cope with them I am persuaded\nthat there is no weapon at our command which we can use so effectively\nto induce the press of the country to refrain from misrepresenting and\nslandering us as a direct appeal to the editors themselves. By the same\ntoken we should never lose an opportunity of thanking the editor of any\npaper or magazine in which articles favorable to us appear. Let us bear\nin mind that editors are decidedly human. Whenever I have come into personal\ncontact with them, I have been deeply impressed with this fact.\nAnd we must also make up our minds not to weary with well doing. Continual\ndropping wears away a stone. I believe continual writing to an editor\nwill also melt his heart of stone. But whether it does or not in our weakness\nand confusion to day, when the very heavens seem [bra?] above us, who\nour enemies seem to increase and our friends to dwindle away, it will certainly\ndo no harm to try to appeal for justice to the editors of the American press\nwhich is such a powerful agent in presenting us in an unfavorable light\nto the whole civilized world.\n                            10\n     What women may do in the home to promote the welfare of the race\nis a theme so important and so vast that it could not possibly be intelligently\ndiscussed in the few moments that remain. However, there is one\nduty which the mothers, fathers, teachers and guardians of the youth of\nthe race should faithfully discharge. They should do everything in their\npower to instill self respect in our boys and girls. If an individual\ndoes not respect himself, how can he hope that other people will respect\nhim? Every thing is done by the dominant race in this country to deprive\nus of our self respect. Cartoons in the newspapers, jokes on the lecture\nplatform and stories even in the pulpit are of such a nature that we are being continually\nheld up to ridicule and scorn. As if the dominant race could not\ndo sufficient in this direction, in a variety of ways we are continually\nridiculing and belittling ourselves. In the presence of their children\nmothers continually talk about the worthlessness of niggers, indeed many\nmothers call their own children and members of their family by this name\nwhen they are provoked. The most loyal and intelligent among us laugh at\njokes which illustrate how cowardly we are as a race, even if we do not\ncrack these jokes ourselves. We are all familiar with that type of joke in\nwhich a Colored man is described as boasting greatly of his courage.\nThe joke represents him as saying, if some white man does this or that\nthing to him, he will slap the white man's face, or knock him down or\neven murder him, perhaps. But as soon as the white man does this particular\nthing, the joke represents the Colored man as taking to his heels in\nfright as fast as he can. Then everybody laughs. Our children hear such\nthings in their own homes and on our stage day after day. Nobody but the\nOmnipotent himself can tell how much our children are influenced and affected\nby this ridicule of the race. To some of you this may seem a very\nsmall thing, but it is the small things of life which make or mar one's\nexistence. It is the little foxes which spoil the vines. Nobody who has", "6", 25, 25, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-024:00014", "13\nthe dominant race and that to which they belong is a difference of external\nthings, such as the opportunities of education and moral training rather\nthan a difference in native ability. A Colored child should be told\nagain and again that his race is not so far advanced along some lines\nas that of the dominant race, because it has had so few advantages and\nsuch meager opportunities in comparison with those who enjoyed by those who\nhold the reign of power in their hands. Even if we do not believe this\nourselves, and can not be converted to this view, let us not present the\nother side to a child because of the harm it will do. I am personally\nacquainted with one of the finest musicians we have had, who has not accomplished\nwhat he might otherwise have achieved, because he was impressed\nin his youth with the inferiority of his race. I have heard him say \"What\nis the use of my having high ideals and lofty standards, I am descended\nfrom a race of slaves who have never done anything worth while along any line, and probably never\nwill. It is not in. me. I am doomed by such inheritance to mediocrity at\nbest.\" Perhaps this was an unusual case Let us hope it was. But if one genius\nis discouraged in his youth by the fact that he belongs to a race\ninnately inferior, so that he can never hope to accomplish much on account\nof his wretched inheritance, others may be disheartened in the same\nway.\n     There is no better way of preventing our children from being ashamed\nof their race than by reciting continually the splendid record it has\nmade in war, in the various professions and trades, in education in music\nin art and in every other way, in spite of obstacles which put it severely\nto the test.\n     Let us also insist upon looking upon the bright side of the problem,\nno matter how gloomy and threatening the prospects may appear. The men\nwho has no hope is of little account to himself or anybody else. If it\nis not natural for us to hope, let u cultivate it, as we should charity\n\n\n\n                                            14\nor faith or truth or any other virtue. Dante described hell as a place\nfrom which hope was excluded. Leave all hope behind ye, ye who enter here\nwas written over the gates of hell. By excluding hope we too will turn\nthis beautiful earth into a hell.\n     Let us impress upon our children that some day their condition\nwill indoubtedly improve. No one who has studied the history of the human\nrace can doubt this for a moment. First, one so-called inferior race and\nthen another has startled the superior, [the powerful] and the proud by\nits power and skill, from the day when the wild barabrian hordes crushed\nthe hitherto invincible Roman legions till the present time. Let us also extract\ncomfort and hope from the thought that it is always the unexpected which\nhappens in this uncertain world. What a striking illustration of this\nfact is the present war[.] [In] which burst like an awful thunderbolt from the\nblue and beautiful sky. Only a few weeks before war was declared, only \nthose directly responsible for it could have predicted that in a short\ntime the whole of Europe would be engaged in the most destructive and the\nbloodiest carnage the world has ever seen. The man who but a few weeks\nago would have dared to predict that a beautiful and prosperous country\nlike Belgium would be practically wiped off the may in the twinkling of\nan eye would have been ridiculed or adjudged insane.\n     Just a few months ago the persecuted Jews of Russia who for years\nhave been obliged to live within the pale did not dream that the day\nof justice for them would seen dawn, that they would soon be accorded full political\nrights and all the other rights which other citizens enjoyed.\nAnd yet the Czar of all the Russians has promised positively that the\nJew will never be denied his rights and never be persecuted in Russia\nagain. Who knows but that some such contingency may arise which\nwill be instrumental in destroying the barriers to our happiness and  progress\nwhich hem us in on all sides to day?

In a day and hour when\nit is least expected our fetters will be broken and our bonds be loosed.\nTherefore let us keep a constant agitation against our wrongs and keep\non contending for our privileges and rights. This advice will be distasteful\nto those who object to having the race problem discussed. For this\ntype of Colored man or woman it is difficult to account at all, and yet\nthey exist. They say they are sick and tired of hearing about the obstacles\nto our progress. They do not take the Crisis, for instance, because\nthey do not like to read about the lynchings, the convict biased system,\nthe chain gangs and the other barbarities which mock the civilization\nand the Christian of the U.S. at the present time. It is difficult\nto understand the mental and spiritual make up of Colored people who\nassume such an attitude toward the discussion of the race problem to day.\nIt seems hardly possible that any member of the race should be so narrow\nin his interests, so lacking in sympathy for those to whom he is bound\nby the ties of blood as to be surfeited with facts relating to the race\nproblem of to day. Long after the barriers of injustice have burned\naway and the bars of race prejudice have been battered down, mankind will\ndiscuss the conditions which confront Colored people in the U.S at the present time today. Books will\nbe written upon this burning question and lives will be spent in its\nstudy. It will be a source of inspiration to white and black alike for\ncenturies to come. Imagination will enrich itself upon the tremendous\nsacrifices which Colored people have made and the persecutions they have heroically endured. And yet there\nare Colored people in this country to day to whom destiny has granted\nthe privilege of helping to solve this stupendous problem who are allowed\nto play an important role in this great drama founded upon the oppression\nand the struggle of a heavily-handicapped race, who actually turn\naway from it in sheer blas\u00e9 indifference.

It was the old story of\nfirst an engagement and then an estrangement between the two parties to the\ncontract and the man, at least, was taking it hard.  Alice Collier's\nfriends declared that the breach had not affected that young lady's\nspirits at all.  She carried her head as high as she did before the\nengagement was broken and she was as serene and placid of countenance as\never, they said.  From this they judged, either that the wound in Miss\nCollier's affection had not been very deep, or that it had rapidly healed.\nNobody knew exactly what the trouble was all about, but every body knew\nthere had been trouble.  The two young people had been engaged several\nyears, according to common report, and were always in each other's company,\nThat was a thing of the past now, and under such circumstances the world\nalways knows what conclusion to reach.\n       Arthur Carson was still standing by the mantel, his eyes fastened\nupon the floor as though he expected to find some consolation there,\nwhen somebody rapped loudly at the door.  \"You're as deaf as a door nail\nArthur Carson\", said the visitor, as he entered.  \"I've knocked three\ntimes at least.

But you were such a picture of distress, when\nI saw you, your face scared it out of my mind.  I got a letter to day\nfrom Dick Henderson, who lives in Philadelphia, you know.

You can arrange to take a little\nvacation, just as well as I can.

As I think over our misunderstanding, I am sure I was to\nblame in the beginning.

When the young lady entered the room, he arose, made a \nprofound bow, solemnly notified her that he had found something of great\nvalue to her, which she had evidently lost or allowed to stray. He\ndrew nearer to her and showed her the letter which he had found in the\ntrunk. One glance was sufficient for her to grasp the situation. In\nher effort to recover possession of the valuable document, her hands were\ncaught and tightly held. The struggle was short, and when it was over, \nthe young lady's head rested comfortably on the shoulder of the young\nman. \"The morning the trunk was sent for, \" she explained, \"I was  talking\nto a friend who had called.

She's by no \nmeans a Sunday School heroine, it is true, but \nshe's a colored woman who is the principal figure\nin a play that ran nearly two years in New \nYork City and is drawing large houses in Chicago \nwhere you really have to pay something \nto get a seat. There is very little that a women \nwho has forsaken the straight and narrow can \ndo which Lulu Bell does not do first and last in \nthis play which David Belasco has staged so\nartistically, but she is decidedly up to date in \nher carryings on and is no back number.\nThat's right.  \n\nLulu Belle is A. \nThief From The Heart\n\nThis is the way that a man who has just seen \nthe play Lulu Bell in the Illinois Theatre in \nChicago expressed himself to me a few days \nago. To tell the truth, I was worried and could \nnot help it, for I myself had seen it for the \nfirst time. Lulu Bell is a thief from her heart,\nshe steals everything she can lay her hands on. \nShe uses a hypodermic needle on a man that \nhas been lured to her room, and takes his\nmoney and all his valuables. Then after she\nhas left him lying helpless on the floor, she \nsuddenly remembers he has a gold tooth and \nrushes back to pull that out of his mouth. \n\nLulu Bell causes a man to forsake his family.    \nHe leaves his wife and children because he cannot \nresist her. Them she goes to Paris with a \nFrenchman who is infatuated with her and \nlives with him five years. The last scene of this \nplay presents Lulu Bell in a beautiful apartment \nwearing ravishing apparel. The man who deserted \nhis family for her has completed a sentence\nin prison and has come to Paris to find \nher, because he says he cannot live without her.\nHe tries to persuade her to return to him, and \nwhen she scornfully spurns him, he chokes her \nto death. This is a brief but incomplete review \nof this play which has attracted so much \nattention and has caused people to express such \na variety of views. \n\nActress Taking Leading \nPart Is A Jewess\n\nI am willing to admit that the play is proof \nof the fact that we have made progress along \ntheatrical lines. I was sorry that the actress \nwho took the part of Lulu Bell is a white \nwoman. She is a Jewess-Miss Lenore Ulric \nwho reads her lines admirably and plays the \nrole like the artist which she undoubtedly is. \nAll the stars in the play are white. The crowd\nwhich represents the Harlem scene in the first \nact is mostly composed of colored people, but \nthe rest of the play is presented by white actors. \nSince Mr. Belasco has bestowed such high praise \nupon the histrionic ability of the Colored-\nAmerican, it is a pity he did not find colored \nactors capable of taking the leading parts instead \nof giving them to white people. When \nMr. Belasco read this play for the first time \nto a group of colored people, he said he was \namazed at the rapidity with which they grasped \nits meaning, learned the lines and understood \nhow to act the various roles. There was no \nreason, therefore, why colored actors could not \nhave been found to produce Lulu Bell from \nstart to finish. And that is the discouraging \nthing. The patrons of the theatre are willing \nto see colored people presented on the stage, \nprovided the parts are taken by white people. \nThere have been some exceptions to this, but \nthey have been comparatively few. \n\nWill Patrons Get The Idea \nThat She Represents Colored Women?\n\nBut the character of this colored woman - \nLulu Bell - as she is presented in the play disturbed \nmy peace of mind considerably. Will \nthe white patrons who see her in Chicago and \nelsewhere get the idea that she represents \ncolored women as a whole? Do the white \npeople who have been looking at Lulu Bell for \ntwo years in New York City have a more wholesome \nopinion of colored women? That is indeed \nthe question. It is useless to say that    \nLulu Bell is only a fictitious character, and \nthat people have sense enough to recognize \nthat fact. \n\nIntelligent people know that it is unjust and \nstupid to judge any group of human beings by \ntheir lowest and most vicious representatives, \nand yet that is precisely what they are doing\nto colored people all the time. They themselves \nwould not like to be judged by the unfortunates \nwho infest the slums of the large cities, and \nyet that is practically the awful test to which \nthey subject their brothers and sisters of a \ndarker hue. It is useless also to say that the \nmost popular plays on the boards today are \nthose which represent white women of easy \nvirtue and depraved tastes. It would never occur \nto any white American to think that such \ncharacters represent the women of his group. \nIt will be very easy however, for them to learn \nto think of Lulu Bell as a typical colored women \nand with no intention of perpetrating an injustice \nupon the women of our group many of \nthem who have witnessed this play will see a \nprobable Lulu Bell in every colored woman they \nmeet. Let a dog have a bad name, and everybody \nis tempted to give him a kick. No group\nof human beings in the world suffers more \nfrom the \"bad name\" which their enemies and \ndetractors have unjustly given them than do \nthe colored people of the United States. The \nmore I think of the play Lulu Bell, the more \nI fear it will do colored women no good. \n\nSouth Not Only Place Where \nLaw Falls To Protect Colored \n\nSpeaking of colored women reminds me that \nthe South is not the only place in this country \nwhere they receive little protection in the \nCourts of law. A few days ago a jury in Chicago \nwas severely rebuked by a judge, because\nit recommended that a white youth who had \ncriminally assaulted a colored girl only sixteen \nyears old should receive the minimum penalty \nof one year in the penitentiary. \"It's a travesty \non justice\" cried the judge. The Assistant\nState's Attorney declared that the jury's finding \nwas a disgrace and demanded a new trial \nwhich was granted. The judge deserves the \ngratitude of every colored person in the United \nStates for rebuking the rapist's lawyer, when \nhe declared that the representatives of the \nrace who lived in a certain section of the city \nwere all immoral. \"You are maligning Colored \npeople as a whole,\" protested the judge. \"What \nyou say is not true and you must stop it.\" How \nrare it is that slanders hurled against colored \npeople in our out of the Court are resented by\nwhite people who have the power to protect \nthe maligned group.\n\nHealth Conditions In \nChicago Alarming\n\nNot so long ago we were accustomed to think \nthat the health conditions of colored people \nliving in the South were worse than those which \nobtained in any other part of the United \nStates. But that is no longer true. During \nthe World War so many colored people flocked \nto the North, Eats and West to better their \ncondition financially that they soon began to \nsuffer physically on account of the unsanitary \nsurroundings in which they were forced to live.  \nOne is shocked for instance, to learn that six\ntimes as many colored people die from tuberculosis \nin Chicago as white people. That the \ndeath rate is twice as high as is that for the \nrest of the population and that practically twice \nas many colored babies die per thousand as do   \nthe babies of other racial groups. \n\n  \n\n", "33", 30, 30, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-024:00104", "Nothing could afford me greater pleasure than to welcome the wives, \nmothers, daughters sisters and sweethearts of the National Alliance of Postal\nEmployees who are now holding a Biennial Convention in this city.\nAlthough I have been asked to take part in several Welcome to our City \nPrograms, this is the first time I have been invited to welcome the women \nmembers of the family who have come to take part in a convention held by men\nAnd this is as it should be, The husbands, fathers, brothers, sons and beaus \nshould attend the convention held by women, whenever that is possible and \nthe women of the family should all pack their dress suit cases and accompan\nthe men.\nI want to congratulate the Women's Auxiliary of the National Alliance \nof Postal Employes on the fine aggregation of men by which they are represented\nThe colored women of the country are proud of these men who render such efficient\nand faithful service in the Post Office Department of the United States \nWe realize that in common with [the] other citizens [of] we are largely indebted\nto them for many of the advantages which we enjoy. .Thanks to them it is \npossible for us to hear from loved ones from whom we are separated by water \nand land.

And so some of the people who were\nformerly deeply interested in the negro [to the point of advocating his]\ncause have evidently reached the conclusion that the black man used to be\nall right, but that now he is the worst they ever saw. [*by many*]\n[*When col people try to present this phase of the problem they are severely criticized*]\nThe great trouble with the negro, says one, is that he is never satisfied.\n[*boundary, undermined*]\nHe is always whining, or complaining about something. The country\nhas done enough for the black man, let him make a way for himself.\nIn Titue Andronicus Shakespeare tells the story of an unfortunate maid,\nwhose hands were cut off and whose tongue was cut out. After her torturers the miscreants had maimed her they taunted her saying, \"go tell who cut out thy\ntongue, and if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe, write down thy\nmind. I sometimes think that the negro's present position in this country\nis very similar to that of this unfortunate maid. With the ear of the\npublic deaf to his cry for justice and his appeal for an equal chance along with other\nmen, of what avail is his tongue? And if the press in reflecting [the] public opinion\nand catering to the ppublic [mind] taste is naturally averse to making its columns a vehicle through\nwhich the black man may convey his wrongs and woes, what does it avail \nhim,[*and if while he aches a [?] by which to earn an honest living and is\nrefused at every turn and not just [?][?] cut off his hands*]  if he does play the scribe and write down his mind.\nNext to the negro who tries to open the eyes of the public to the\nbehalf, [*wrongs endured*] the most obnoxious person at the present perhaps is the white man's\nwho after cruel unmovable prejudice which rages so naturally against him  \ninsists upon pleading the Negro's cause.

Let's \nget tickets and start right off.\nThere is every reason why we should. \nThey have just discovered a diamond \nfield in Cape colony which is the richest \nin precious stones that has ever\nbeen found in the history of the\nworld. The minister of mines says he\npicked up diamonds worth $3,000\nwhile he was walking around about \nan hour. A few experts pocketed \n$800,000 worth of diamonds in a \ncouple of weeks by \"hand picking\" \nfrom claims owned by the government. \nA director of mines some consolidated \nmines declares that \"It is the \nbiggest diamond field ever discovered\nanywhere.\" \nWell, white people will continue to\ngrow richer and richer on the dark\ncontinent, while the native Africans\nthemselves will probably grow poorer\nand poorer.  It is a great pity that\nsome of our progressive, well educated \nyoung men don't go to Africa\nwhere these diamond fields are located, \njust to see how they look anyhow.  \nThe English will not give our\npeople from the United States a very \ncordial welcome, for they fear they \nwill put \"bad notions\" into the natives \nheads.  But some of our young\nmen with the spirit of adventure\nhighly developed should at least\ngive the gold mines and the diamond \nfields of Africa the \"once over\" just\nto see what will happen. It is a pity \nthat practically nobody with\nAfrican blood in his veins is getting\nany benefit from the priceless treasure \nof all kinds with which the continent \nof Africa is filled. How long,\nO Lord, how long?\n\nWho remembers Coxey's famous\narmy? Let me warn you not to\nadmit remembering it if you don't\nwant people to know you are more\nthan 34 years old. For it was 34 \nyears ago that Coxey came marching \ninto the national capital with\n5,000 men who were out of work and\ncouldn't get a job.  And now, after \nall those years have passed, Coxey\nsays he is going to bring another\narmy of jobless men into Washington \nif people don't look out. When \nhe brought his army into Washington \nthe first time there were only \n3,000.000 men out of work. Now \nthere are 4,500,000 without jobs.\nThe American Federation of Labor\nadmits that many of its members\nare unemployed. Since most unions\ngive special aid to their members in\nfinding employment, it is probable\nthat unemployment among unorganized \nworkers is much higher.  The \ngreatest percentage of unemployment\nreported in a survey which was recently \nmade was in Baltimore, while\nthe lowest was in Chicago, Detroit,\nPhiladelphia, and New York are cities\nwhich have been most seriously affected \nand have the greatest number \nof unemployed men. The dinner\npails of working men are no longer \nfull.\n\"General\" Coxey lays all the blame\nfor existing conditions upon the federal \nreserve system. It deliberately \nbrought about the hard times, he \nsays, by restricting credit and slackening \nproduction. It has miserably \nfailed, he claims. Most of us will\nagree with the general on one of his\nhobbies. He does not believe in interest. \nHe says the farm problem \nand others would be solved if the \ngovernment would lend the farmers \nmoney on easy terms. \"Interest on \nmoney must be abolished,\" he says.\n\"If this civilization is to endure.\" \nMany of us will say amen to that. \nWe fear, however, it will be a long \ntime before Coxey's ideas on interest\nwill prevail.\n\nFlappers in China are just like \ntheir sisters in the United States.\nThe man once known as the \"Christian \nGeneral\" says he cannot keep his\nsoldiers interested in the revolution\nwhich he is trying to put over because \nthe young Chinese women who\nhave been allowed to work in the nationalist \nmovement are so fascinating \nand attractive to his men. So \nthe general has issued a stern decree\nthat if any bachelor among them\nmarries or if any married man tries\nto get a divorce from his wife before \nthe revolution succeeds, such a \nsoldier shall be put to death. Even \nthe older officers are giving the general \na lot of trouble, because they \nare so infatuated with these young\nChinese flappers.  \"These officers,\"\ncomplains the general, \"have wives\nin their homes who are old fashioned, \nilliterate and have bound feet. \nWhen they come in contact with the \nmodern bobbed haired young women\nthey neglect their old homes and \nhelpmates and seek freedom in new\nunions.\"  This shocks Marshal Feng\nvery much, for he says it is contrary\nto Chinese morality. \nThis story teaches that men and \nwomen are the same all over the \nworld, no matter whether they are\nwhite, black, yellow, grizzle, or gray. \n\nIt is a pity that the stupid loyalty\nof certain men in the Smithsonian\ninstitution here in Washington to \nSamuel P. Langley has caused Orville\nWright to send to the British museum\nthe first airplane in which a human\nbeing ever flew.  Mr. Langley died\nof a broken heart some years ago\nwhen the airplane on which he had\nhung all his hopes was wrecked not\nfar from this city.  To be sure, the\nairplane came near being a success.\nBut the fact remains that it wasn't.\nSome little thing that needed adjustment \nwas out of whack, so, of \ncourse, Langley's plane did not fly.\nThose are the simple facts. Mr. \nLangley himself did not claim that\nthe machine which he built actually\ndid fly, for everybody knew it didn't.\nThen the Wright brothers went down\nto Kitty Hawk, N.C. and built an\nairplane according to their own \nmeasurements and ideas which did\nfly. That is a bit of history which\nnobody who has any regard for truth\ncan deny. But some of the Smithsonian \nofficials pasted a label on \nLangley's machine which indicated\nthat it was the first airplane which \nmade a successful flight.  That was \nnot the truth.  The first airplane\nwhich ever carried a human being\nthrough the air was the Wright machine \nand Orville Wright was the \nman who flew.  Langley deserves a \ngreat deal of credit for what he did.\nHe just missed by a fluke.  After the\nWright brothers succeeded in making\ntheir plane fly, it was not difficult \nto discover what was wrong with \nLangley's.  A wise man once said that \n\"A little thing makes perfection, but\nperfection is no little thing.\"  The\nlittle thing that was lacking in Langley's \nmachine kept it from flying\nthrough the air. \nSince Orville Wright feels that the\ncredit which is due his brother and\nhimself has been deliberately taken\nfrom him by certain stubborn officials\nof the Smithsonian institute, he refuses \nto allow his plane to stay there.\nIt is of priceless value; is the first \nairplane in which a human being \never flew! It is an historic relic \nwhich any country would be glad to\npossess.  It is to be hoped that some\ncompromise will be made whereby\nOrville Wright will consent to allow\nhis plane to remain in the place in\nthe United States where it belongs.\nWill Rogers, the humorist, made a \nvery wise comment on this controversy \nwhen he declared that the \ntrustees of the Smithsonian institute \ndecided \"Langley's machine could\nhave flown first, but didn't.\"  \"I could\nhave flown to France ahead of Lindbergh,\" \nhe said, \"but I just neglected\ndoing it.  I had a lot of other things\non my mind at the time.\"\n\nUp to Date\nA Brief Survey of\nCurrent Happenings\nBy Mary Church Terrell May 10 '28\n\nAt last a brave man has appeared\nwho is trying to free his\nfellow sufferers from a fearful bondage\nwhich they have endured for\nyears. A well known man in Great\nBritain appeared at a public dinner\na few days ago all dressed up in a \nshirt that had an open front like a \nsports shirt, with a flaring roll collar\nof semistiff material without a tie,\n\"I have taken a lead to freedom,\" he\nsaid proudly to his friends who gazed\nat his speechless with surprise. He\nwas tired of being yoked up in the\nregulation dress shirt with a stiff\ncollar, he said, and so help him! he\nwas never going to wear one again.\nHe would go to jail before he would\nbe tortured any longer trying to look\npleasant at a party or dinner with\nhis neck walled up in a collar as stiff\nas a board. A short while before\nthis champion of liberty marched into\na public dinner wearing his comfortable\nshirt with a soft collar, the\nprince of wales inveighed strongly\nagainst the tyranny of the boiled\nshirt. Now the whole boiled shirt\npopulation is waiting breathlessly to\nsee whether the prince of Wales will\nfollow suit. Let us hope the day of\nliberating men from stiffly starched\ncollars has dawned at last. How\nthey have stood it so long it is hard\nto understand. It makes the heart\nof a humane person ache to see a\npoor man such a slave to a cruel,\nsenseless fashion that he insists upon\nwearing a stiff collar on a hot night.\nIt begins to wilt as soon as he gets\ninto the room. He exerts himself\ntrying to make it behave and the\neffort thus expended causes him to\nperspire which makes the collar wilt\nmore. It looks as though long suffering\nmen will soon be emancipated\nfrom the boiled shirt and the stiff\ncollar during the summer at least.\n\nIt is a pity that articles can no\nlonger be sent from the United\nStates to Cuba of from Cuba to the\nUnited States. Congress has refused \nto let Cuba send cigars to this country\nin lots of less than 3,000 and\nCuba declares that since congress\nhas taken that stand the postal understanding\nbetween the two countries\nis at an end. \"Cuba has faithfully\nperformed her part of the\nagreement with the United States\nfor 25 years,\"  said the second assistant\npostmaster general, \"but owing\nto the 1866 tobacco law all cigar shipments\nfrom Cuba have been excluded\nhere, giving the United States all the\nbest of the bargain.\"\n     As a result of the termination of\nthe postal understanding between the\ntwo countries not even a pocket\nhandkerchief can be sent to Cuba\nexcept by express or freight and\nAmerican railroads will lost nearly\n$1,000,000 a year in revenues.\n\nWhen are you going to buy your\nnew airplane? Better save up\nyour money, for you will have a\nchance to get a brand new airplane\nsoon. Then you can fly around the\ncountry much cheaper than you can\nnow in an automobile, considering\nhow much faster you can go. It used\nto cost money to buy an airplane, but\nan inventor who has never fooled the\npublic and who has always made\ngood says he can put an airplane\nweighing only 500 pounds on the market\nwhich will cost much less than\n$1,000. This airplane, he says, doesn't\nhave to be provided with a long runway\nto take off, but it rises straight\nup from the ground, travels forward\nat a high rate of speed and can be\nlanded, if necessary, through an open\nwindow. That being the case, there\nis no reason why the average citizen\nshould not own one. The Englishman\nwho flew from England to Australia\nproved that you could sail through\nthe air for two cents a mile. He flew\n12,000 miles for $250. Nobody could\ntravel in an automobile that long\ndistance for so small a sum. If the\nairships keep up this rapid improvement,\nthe auto will have to look to its\nlaurels if it does not want to be left\nbehind.\n\nBad news for the bald-headed \ngentlemen who sit on the front \nseat at the show! The other day Flo\nZiegfeld blew into Washington and\nmade them gasp when he told them\nthat he is going to scrap the Follies.\nNo more follies for him, he says.\nHe declares he is tired of being\nclassed with those who are responsible\nfor shows full of nude women.\nThe women in Ziegfeld's shows certainly\ncould not be accused of wearing \nany excess clothing. Ever since\nhe brought out the Follies, either he\nor somebody else has so designed the\nlack of costumes worn by the women\nthat they left very little to the imagination.\nScrapping the Follies will\nbe hard on some of the gentlemen\nwho like to gaze on \"beauty unadorned,\"\nbut it will be good for most\nof the rest of us.\n. . .\n\nSpeaking of Africa reminds me \nof a story which shows how the\nnatives are being intimidated by the\nwhite people over there. Perhaps\nthe ardor of a young American who\nwas thinking seriously of going to\nthe home of his ancestors might be\nconsiderably cooled thereby. Just the\nother day an effort was made to\nlynch three prisoners who were accused\nof destroying some tombstones\nin Natal, South Africa. An anti-native\ndemonstration was staged by\nthe white residents and almost the\nentire population gathered outside\nthe town hall bent on storming the\njail and lynching the natives. Special\npolice had to be sworn in. The\nprisoners were smuggled out of the\njail and taken to a near by town to\nprotect them. When the leaders of\nthe mob saw they had been frustrated\nthey vented their spleen by setting\nfire to the native labor offices.\n     Perhaps the leaders of the mob\nwere Americans carrying into Africa\nthe methods of dealing with their\ndark-skinned brothers which they\noften use over here. The lawless\ncitizens of this country have a great\ndeal to answer for. They have led\nthe way in criminal exhibitions of\nrace prejudice and have shown the \nrest of the world how little they\nvalue the life of a human being whose\nface is dark.\n\nMarch 24 - '28\nUp to Date\nBy MARY CHURCH TERRELL\nA Brief Survey of\nCurrent Happenings\n\n\"A Colored woman might be\nelected to the senate of the\nUnited States and attend White\nHouse receptions if you have suffrage\nin the District of Columbia.\" This\nwas the awful warning which a man\nwho opposes suffrage in the capital\nof the nation hurled at those who\nare trying to get it. The people of\nWashington are disfranchised and \nmany of them are trying to have the\nright of citizenship which they once\nenjoyed restored to them through the\nDyer resolution granting national\nrepresentation. But there are white\ncitizens here who are terribly excited\nabout this effort which is being made\nby the majority, because they declare\nthat the Race population will hold\nthe balance of power if the franchise\nis granted to the District. The\nspokesman for this group declared\nat a hearing before the judiciary\ncommittee this week that the Race\npopulation had increased four times\nas fast as the white during the last\nfive years, and predicted all sorts of\nhorrors and disasters if our people\nare allowed to vote. There will be\na corrupt political ring, he says, and \nthere is no telling what may happen.\n     Especially is this pale prophet of\nevil worried because there are more\nwomen of our Race in Washington\nthan men. In his mind's eye he sees\nall these women banding together\nand electing one of their number to\nthe senate of the United States. And\nthen the horror's crown of horror will\nbe enacted, for this dark woman will\neven attend the White House receptions,\nhe feels sure. So there are\nwhite people in the national capital\nwho would rather be deprived of their\nright of citizenship than see our\npeople enjoy it!\n     Everybody in the United States\nshould be interested in what goes on\nin Washington, for the city belongs\nto those who do not live here as well\nas to those of us who do. It is an\noutrage that the people who live here\nare disfranchised. Many of the\nleading citizens have been exerting\nstrenuous efforts for several years to\nright this terrible wrong. They have\nrequested people who live in the\nStates and who enjoy the franchise\nto write to their congressmen urging\nthem to vote for the constitutional\namendment which will restore suffrage\nto the District of Columbia.\nMany living in the States have complied\nwith this reasonable request and\nmany more will do so, it is to be\nhoped. There is no doubt whatever\nthat many conditions which are imposed\nupon the citizens of Washington\nby congress, because they have\nno vote and cannot help themselves,\nwould be improved or removed altogether\nif they had a voice in the \nmanagement of their own affairs.\nTaxation without representation is as\nunjust to those of us who live in the\ncapital of the United States as it\nwould be to people who live in the \nStates.\n * * *\n\nFor years it has been the custom\nin this country to talk about the\nimmorality of France. The French\nalways came back with the statement\nthat what they do, they do openly\nand do not sneak around the backway\nto do it. But now France says\nAmericans are getting altogether too\nreckless for her, and she has decided\nto curb them, so far as she can in\ntheir mad career. She will no longer\ngrant divorces to rich Americans who\ngo to Paris and to the other French\ncities to seek them. She has recently\nrefused to grant a divorce to\na very wealthy American who tried\nto get one. French people rarely get\na divorce themselves. They frown\nupon it. Americans have carried\nsome of their worst scandals into the\ncourts of France, which have greatly\nshocked both the reputable people of\nthat country as well as the press.\nFor a while the French laughed at\nthe epidemic of American divorces,\njust as they smile at Americans who\nget so many thrills out of the night\nclubs and places of amusement which\nare supported largely by visitors.\nBut so many stage and screen favorites\nand society queens from the\nUnited States began to tell the world\nthat they were going to France to\nrelieve themselves of their undesirable\nmates that this objectionable\nnotoriety began to get onto the nerves\nof the thoughtful French people and\nthe Paris press began to insist that\nit was hurting the reputation of\nFrance. So hereafter rich Americans\nwill not be able to combine business\nwith pleasure by running over to\nFrance on a summer vacation and\nget a divorce while they wait.\n\n* * *\n\nThe way women are forging ahead\nin the industrial, commercial,\nmechanical and professional pursuits\nin this country is amazing. There\nare 9,000,000 women holding such\npositions in the United States today.\nFor a long time they have been\ncrowding into the unskilled occupations,\nbut now they are receiving\nvocational training in many states\nand are engaging in all kinds of \ntrades and professions with marked\nsuccess. It is especially gratifying\nto see how many women of the Race\nare making a good living in business,\nin the various industries and even in\nthe professions. According to statistics,\nthere are more wage earning\nwomen of our Race in the United\nStates than can be found among the\nwomen of any other racial group.\n\n* * *\n\nHURRAH for Ethiopia! For the\nfirst time in 20 years she has a \nreal, live American minister in her\nmidst. The gentleman hails from\nLouisville, Ky., too.

EDWARDS\nIS THERE any reason why we\nshould not outdie everybody else?\nIn nearly ever newspaper and \nmagazine one takes time to read, he\nfinds an alarming discussion on the\nhigh death rate among Negroes. We\nare branded by some writers as the\n\"vanishing race.\" It seems easy for\nthem to find facts and figures, while\na solution is unthought of. They all\nseem to be satisfied with finding the\nevidence. The Metropolitan Life Insurance\ncompany was the first last \nyear to issue a report on our death\nrate. After discovering the high\ndeath rate and determining the cause,\nthe Metropolitan Insurance company\nhas done nothing to help remedy it.\nDespite the fact that it has more\nthan 2,000,000 Colored policyholders\n--paying premiums running far into\nthe millions--it does not employ a \nsingle Negro collector or agent.\nTHE principal cause of the high\ndeath rate among Colored people\nis due to the lack of money with\nwhich to live decently and properly.\nIn order to live properly there must\nbe clean, well ventilated homes--on\nclean, well-kept streets; there must\nbe ample, wholesome and properly\nprepared food--and time to eat, according\nto the rules of health. There\nmust be clothing--and countless other\nnecessities of human life. The great\nmass of Negroes are not able to procure\nthese requisites--they suffer and die.\nMANY would live if they were able\nto consult and employ a physician.\nBut the scarcity of money\ncauses them to put off medical aid\nuntil it is too late. Many babies die \nfrom the lack of proper attention,\nand many women are made barren\nby the heavy work they do. Many\nrefuse to be mothers because they \nhave to work.\nSECOND, the success of the ma-\n\nare little better than sheds; there are\noften 50 or 60 pupils to one teacher,\nno equipment, and a poorly trained\nteacher who receives from $20 to $25\na month. The school sessions often\ndo not exceed three months in length.\nMIGRATION CHANGES\nSOCIAL SYSTEM\nTen years ago the man who spoke\nof the day when the masses of the\nNegroes would begin anything like a \ngenral migration northward was\nlaughed at as a \"Yankee fool,\" but\ntoday one hears these same men discussing\nthe labor problem at every\nvillage store, street corner and postoffice.\nThe southerner used to boast\nof his abilities to \"handle the nigger,\"\nbut now that the Race, moved by\ndiverse and widespread impulses, begins\non its own accord to migrate on\na stupendous scale, the South is both\namazed and desperately worried over\nthe outcome. That the migration of\nsuch vast numbers of southern Negroes\nto the North will alter the\nwhole race question in America and \nswell it into such mighty proportions\nas to change the status of the \nentire Negro Race in the nation no\none can doubt. But it will do more\nthan this, for it will change the status\nof the white man in the South.\nNever before have so many white\nmen in the South entered the ranks\nof common laborers as now, and never\nbefore have so many of the young \nwhite men of the South sought employment\nin the North.\n\"LET'S STOP BEING STUPID\"\nWRITER URGES\nAgain the South tried to persuade \nherself to believe that these same\nNegroes who had lived all their lives\nin the bondage of debt, want, and \nprivation would come back to the \nplantations like the prodigal son of\nold. The facts are that they aren't \ndoing it and they won't. In the North\nthe employers are studying the vast\narmies of Negro laborers that come\nto them, to learn their likes and dislikes,\nweaknesses, failures, needs, and \nhealth requirements. They are not\nonly succeeding in holding the Negroes\nbut in getting far better work \nout of them than on the plantations.\nThe vice president of a large steel\norganization expresses himself on\nthis point in the following manner:\n\"We are making a careful study of\nthe Negro. He may not realize the\nneed of warm clothes and good shoes\nunder out climate. We see that he\ngets them.

They have especially marked\nout and designed with their eye, as\nCicero once said, organizations and\nindividuals who are working to promote \nthe welfare of Colored people,\nJews and Catholics.

The grand\nmoguls of the organization come here\ndressed within an inch of their\nwould-be aristocratic lives.   When\nthey held their meetings few of the \nmembers know what it is all about.\nThey squabble over the offices and\nhave almost come to blows with each\nother more frequently than they\nwould like to admit.  Once, when the\npresident general (I believe that is \nthe lady's title) was to be elected, \nsomebody who wanted it herself\nissued a pamphlet containing the\nmost scurrilous and scandalous\ncharge imaginable against the candidate, \nwho she feared might poll\nmore votes than she herself could\nget.  I have never read in print a \nmore disgraceful attack made upon\none woman by another than that\npamphlet which was distributed\namong the members of the D.A.R.\ncontained, until the leaflets were\nseized and confiscated.\n     If the Colored women of this country \nhad ever made such a shameful\nexhibition of themselves as the\ndaughters of the D.A.

There is no doubt that\nthe D.A.R has some fine, upstanding, \nright-thinking, broad-minded\nwomen in its leadership.

Let me \nintroduce you to the finest exhibition\nof real, genuine, high-toned honesty\nthat you will read about in many a \nday.  She is a Colored woman who\nlives right here in Washington, but\nshe is not a member of the D. A. R.\nShe found six dollars on the street\none day and took it to the police department \nright away.  It remained\nthere unclaimed for a long time. Then\nthe finder was notified that she might\nhave it.  But she calmly sent word\nto the authorities that she could not\ntake it because it did not belong to\nher!  Whether the policeman who\nread the letter fainted dead away, or\npromptly died of heart failure I cannot \nsay.  It is say to assert that if \nhe ever recovers from this unprecedented, \ndyed-in-the-wool honesty,\nhe will never be the same.  I wonder\nhow many people there are in the\nUnited States of American who would\nrefuse to accept money they had\nfound and to which they were entitled\non the ground that they could not\ntake it because it did not belong to \nthem? Figure that problem out.\n***\n   The doctors might do well to put\non their thinking caps about a \nrare care which has just occurred.\nA Civil war veteran, 84 years old, \nwho has been deaf for many years,\ndiscovered that his hearing had been\nrestored when he stepped from an \nairplane here in which he had flown\nfrom Gettysburg, Pa.  He says when\nhe was about 2,000 feet up in the air\nhe felt his eustachian tubes open and\ndiscovered that he could hear perfectly \nwell when he landed.  Why is\nthat not a hing which may be used\nto great advantage in curing deafness?\n   Here is an illustration of what setting \na bad example leads to.  For \nmany years gentlemen from a certain\nsection of this country have not\nhesitated to declare in season and out\nthat they were violating two important \namendments to the Constitution.  \nThey not only have told the\nworld that they were openly breaking\nthe laws of their country, but they\nhave boasted of it and dared anybody\nto stop them.  Since the 14th and \n15th amendments to the Constitution\nwere adopted another one has been\nincorporated into the law of the land \n--the 18th amendment, commonly\nknown as the Volstead act.  And now\ngentlemen belonging to that group\nwhich suffers because the 14th and\n15th amendments to the Constitution\nare violated do not hesitate to say,\nwhen occasion requires, that they do\nnot obey the law either. A congress-\nman from Texas (Tom Blanton by \nname) has been the storm center of\na trial in which grave charges against\na policeman were preferred.  Nothing \nlike it has ever occurred before\nin this city.  Fist fights have been\nthreatened and almost pulled off, a\nnaughty word of four letters beginning \nwith \"h\" and rhyming with bell\nhas been uttered and names have\nbeen called which one does not hear\nin polite society.\n   In this famous trial two Colored\nmen were called upon to testify.  One\nof them looked the court boldly in\nthe eye and stated distinctly that he\nwas a \"professional bootlegger, \nwas proud of it and didn't care who\nknows it.\"  Another also stated that\nhe didn't care who knew he boot-legged, \nthat he wasn't afraid to admit\nit in the presence of policemen, because \nthey knew it already. Here,\nthen, are Colored men who boast of\nviolating the 18th amendment just as\nsouthern white men boast of violating \nthe 14th and the 15th amendments.  \nBut many will be shocked at \nthe open admission of lawlessness\nmade by the Colored men who will\npat the white men on the shoulder\nfor the many crimes they have committed \nin depriving human beings of\ntheir rights.  It all depends on whose\nox is gored.\n***\n   Dear Lindy has been taking all\nthe senators, representatives, their\nsisters and their cousins and their\naunts on flying trips here this week,\nbut as yet nobody except those identified \nwith the dominant race has\nbeen invited to ascent into the\nheavenly ether with that wonderful\nyouth.  It is not his fault that this \nis so.

But, making a sacrifice for\nthe sake of science, she subjected\nherself to the possibility of a life of\npain and suffering which might have \nbeen far worse than death.

Well,\nall those varieties of gentleman have\nbeen holding an unemployment conference \nin their capital as they have\na perfect right to do, and some of us \nhave been educated in the qualities \nof head, heart and hand peculiar to\neach of them.  A hobo is a gentleman\nreally looking for work and honestly\ntrying to find it.  A tramp is an individual \nwho claims to be looking for \na job, hoping he won't find one, but\nwilling to make a stab at it, if it\nalmost knocks him. down.  A bum is\nsomebody who won't work, no matter\nhow much he needs a job and how \nhard you try to make him earn his\ndaily bread.\n   Now these gentleman have concocted \na nice little scheme whereby\na man who doesn't work may get $6\na day from the government.  They\nhave it all nicely worked out, because\nsince they do not work for a living,\nthey have time enough to work out\nschemes by which they can exist\nhappily without going to work like\nthe common herd.  The unemployment \nconference has been presided\nover by a millionaire hobo who is the\neditor of the Hobo News, Dr. J. Eads\nHowe bu  name.  He scornfully refused \nto accept a bequest of several\nmillions a few years ago.\n   If this gentleman and his friends\nsucceed in persuading the government \nto pay all the unemployed men\nin this country $6 a day it will only\ncost us about $15,000,000,000, for according \nto Senator Shipstead, there\nare 8,000,000 men out of work.  The\nmembers of the unemployment conference \ntried to get an audience with\nPresident Coolidge, but he was too\nbusy to see them.  It might take quite\nsome time to convince the president\nthat this scheme was sound economically.  \nThe conference adjourned to\nmeet here again April 31, in time to \nform an army for Coxey to lead.  The \ncountry has not heard the last of \nthese gentleman by any means.\n   The next time you come to the\nnational capital and go on a sight-seeing \ntour there will be something\nnew for you to see.  The knights\nof the Ku Klux Klan have just removed \ntheir office from Atlanta, Ga.,\nto Washington, D.C.  And here they \nwill have their executive department\non Massachusetts Ave., directly opposite \nfrom the Knights of Columbus,\na Catholic organization, as everybody\nknows.  From 50 to 60 men are involved \nin the sift, the imperial\nwizard states, but the national secretary's \noffice, the robe and regalia\nand printing plants will remain at \nAtlanta.  A waiting world has also\nbeen informed by the chief kluxer\nthat the order intends to buy and\nbuild quarters in Washington so that\nthe personnel may be adequately\nhoused.\n   The trail of the serpent has now\nextended to England and Australia\nThose two countries are now ripe for\nthe launching of a Ku Klux Klan, it\nis said.\n   It seems hard to believe that an\norganization which is founded on\nprinciples that stir up strife between\npeople of different races and religions\nshould flourish in a republic built\nupon equality and freedom.  It seems\nstill hard to believe that the leaders\nof such an organization would have\nthe effrontery to direct its operations\nfrom the capital of the United States.\n***\n   Already two southern states\nhave barred members of our Race\nfrom voting in the primaries.  A man\ntried to vote in Richmond, VA., but\nwas told that \"Negro Democrats were\nnot eligible to vote in the city Democratic \nprimary.\" When the man took\nthe matter to court the judge who\npresided in the case denied his petition \nand rendered a decision against\nhim.\n   When the attorney general in Florida \nheard that 60 Race men were trying \nto register in Pensacola he advised \nthe county solicitor there that\n\"Negroes should not be allowed to\nregister and vote in Democratic primary\nelections.\"  This distinguished legal light\nwent so far as to say that while the\nUnited States supreme court held\nthat the law gave Colored Americans\nthe right to vote in the primary, the \nFlorida law on the subject is broad\nand powerful enough to exclude them.\nThe attorney general also advised\nthat the charge of perjury should be\nfiled against those who applied for\nthe oath.  It is outrageous that in a \ncountry which claims to be civilized,\npeople whose duty it is to uphold the\nlaws of the land should be allowed \nto trample upon them with such impunity.  \nAnd few, if  any, even in the\ngroup which suffers the loss of their\ncitizenship rights are making any\nprotests. \n***\n   One does to like to think that\n2,000,000 girls under 20 years of\nage are working for a living in the\nUnited States.  And yet those are the \nfigures which the  director of the \nwoman's bureau in the department of\nlabor has recently given out.  Many \nof those girls are of our Race, for\nstatistics show that there are more\nwage earners among our women than \ncan be found among the women of any\nother group in the United States.  It \nis a good thing for young women to\nhelp support themselves at an early\nage, when that is necessary, but it is \npathetic to see girls going out to work\nto earn their living when they should \nbe in school and should be enjoying\nthe freedom from care to which youth\nis entitled. Earnest efforts should be\nmade to induce those who employ\nyoung women to make their burdens\nas light as possible and to care for\nthem in the best possible way.\n\n\n[*May 5- 1928*]\nUp to Date \nA Brief Survey of Current Happenings\nBy Mary Church Terrell\n\n   Will the men who fought to save\nthe Union allow Major James J.\nWalker of New York city to parade\nthe Confederate uniform there,\nwherever his official staff meets?\nThat is indeed the question!  When\nthe mayor of New York city recently\nwent to Georgia to accept the heroic\nmemorial to the  Confederacy which is\ncarved on Stone Mountain with Gen.\nRobert E. Lee, the central figure, he\nwas so impressed with the later's \n4-year-old grandson that he decided \nto place the youngster on his official\nstaff.  Mayor Walker told the news-\npaper men that he intended to have a \nuniform made for the grandson of\nRobert E. Lee, the famous Confederate \ngeneral, exactly like the one worn\nby his grandfather.  The original is\npreserved in Richmond, Va.\n   Surely the surviving members of\nthe Grand Army of the Republic will\nnot allow this indignity to be heaped\nupon them.  There are many who\nwould regard this as an insult to the\nflag.  To be sure the Civil war is over,\nthe two sections are said to be united\nand we are told we should forget the\n\"late unpleasantness\".  But the trouble \nis that the North has forgotten\ntoo much and too quickly, while the \nSouth never forgets and never fails to\nproclaim its point of view. When one\nconsiders how the South has nullified\nthe 14th and 15th amendments with \nthe connivance of the other sections\nand how it has poisoned the mind of \nthe North against the Colored\nAmerican, one feels like agreeing with\nthose who say, \"After all the South \nand not the North won the Civil war.\"\n   Won't the people of our Race of\nNew York city have something to say\nabout the Confederate uniform which\nthe Confederate general's little grand-\nson will wear to keep alive the memory \nof what it stood for, when their\ngrandparents were enslaved?  It\nseems to me that they should try to express \nan opinion or two about this\nmatter.  Especially since this same\nMayor Walker went out of his way to\ninsult representatives of their Race i\nRome a few months ago.  He refused\nto remain in a cabaret while dark-skinned \nAmericans were present The\nincident was published in an Italian\nnewspaper, Il Progresso, which is the\noldest and most reliable Italian paper\nin the United States.\n   When Jimmy Walker objected to\nthe presence of these Americans in\nthe cabaret in Rome, the proprietor\nrefused to eject them, saying \"I am\na Catholic and the church knows no\nrace discrimination nor distinction,\nsince even the Pope appoints Colored\nbishops.\"  This was a very appropriate \nspeech for an Italian Catholic\nto make to an Irish Catholic who was\ntrying to draw the color line way off\nin Rome.\n   If Jimmy Walker does have a Confederate \nuniform made for the grandson \nof Robert E. Lee and has him \nwear it as a member of his official\nstaff in New York city, every Colored\nAmerican in the United States should \nprotect.\n***\n   A well known newspaper man\ndeclared a few days ago that\n\"the most significant thing in the\nworld today is the increasing self-consciousness \nof the American Negro\nsince the World war.  Not only is \nthe black man beginning to feel his\nimportance in this country, but dark\npeople all over the world are waking\nup and are refusing to allow themselves \nto be kicked around as they did\n15 or 20 years ago, he says.  Let us \nhope the newspaper man reads the \nsigns of the times aright. There are\nmany conditions which might be improved, \nif the group in this country\nwhich is the victim of proscription\nand prejudice realized its power and\ndetermined to wield it to promote\nits welfare.  For one thing, the representatives \nof the Race in the states\nwhere they can cast their ballots, \nknowing they will be counted, might\nuse the suffrage to much better advantage \nthan they do.  When we\nlearn how to do this effectively many\nobstacles to our progress will be removed.\n  ***\n   One cannot help reflecting upon\nthe folly of nations going to war\nand trying to destroy each other\nwhen one sees men representing two\nof the countries which were arrayed \nagainst each other a year years ago\nliving in brotherly love today and\nsetting out on a perilous expedition\ntogether, as did the two Germans\nand the Irishman, who were the first\nto make a successful flight across\nthe Atlantic ocean from east to west.\nEleven years ago they would have\nbeen using machine guns on each\nother and employing all the other\ndiabolical contrivances of war to\nkill each other.  Perhaps these Germans \nor their relatives ruthlessly\nkilled members of Fitzmaurice's\nfamily, if he had any in the World\nwar, or vice versa.  If the matters\nwhich led to that awful conflict had\nbeen settled in some kind of a world\ncourt or by arbitration, the fearful\nloss of human life and the awful suffering, \nnot to mention, the actual\ncost in dollars and cents, would have\nbeen obviated.  It has just been definitely \nestablished by the committee\nappointed for the purpose that 37,000,000 \nhuman lives were destroyed\n during the World war and $362,500,000,000 \nspent.\n   The people themselves did not \nstart that war and they did not want\nit.  Those two Germans and the \nIrishman who are now flying over\nthe ocean together might have been\njust as friendly 11 years ago as they\nare today if the rulers who were not\nobliged to fight themselves had not\nforced other men to sacrifice their\nlives in battle. \n   When a report asked the French \nwoman, Mme. Cuisinier, who insisted\nupon joining her husband in Greenly\nisland so that she might cook for the\nGermans as well as the Irishman,\nwho were stranded there, if she did\nnot think it would see a bit strange \nto her to serve her former enemies,\nthe Germans, she said that is her\ntwo countrymen, Nungesser and Coli,\nwho were lost during their flight\nacross the Atlantic, had needed help\nas those Germans did, she would\nhave wanted somebody to aid them.\nThere was no bitterness in her heart\ntoward these men because they were\nGermans.

At the election in 1924 only 50 per cent of those whose duty it was to vote went to the polls. Some of those who complain loudest about the inferior type of men who are elected to the various offices frequently do not take the time and the pains to cast their ballots for anybody. All they do is to criticize the men after they have been elected. If anybody in this country should make it a matter of conscience and religion to exercise the right of sufferage it is certainly a representative of that group which suffers most when the wrong men are elevated to prominence and power. When men who are hostile to our group are elected to office in many places, we have nobody to blame but ourselves. We do not take the interest in the primaries that we should and often we do not vote when we can and should. \n    It is estimated that 7,000,000 graduates of high schools and colleges will cast their ballots this year for the first time. Efforts are being made to interest this great army of young people in matters affecting their government. They are being educated concerning their duty as citizens and are being urged to discharge them as they should. At a meeting which was recently held in Washington and which was attended by representatives of many organizations and of the two big political parties as well, plans were made to start a crusade to interest people to interest people in their duties as citizens. \n    As a group we shall make a big mistake if we do not wake up politically and start our young men and women on the right track too. Among those 7,000,000 young people who will cast their ballot for the first time this year, there will be a goodly number who have African blood flowing through their veins. What are the teachers and business men of the Race and all other adults going to to to educate our youth in their duties as citizens? We should do a great deal and we should start right away.\n***\n    Among the many jokes cracked at the Race's expense none is more certain to create laughter than that old hackneyed one about love for chicken. To hear some people talk, one would suspect that no group in the world enjoyed eating chicken except ours. Of course an individual who had a sure-enough brain and allowed it to work would know that all the chickens in the world were not raised and killed and cooked just to satisfy the appetite of our people. But what do folks care for facts when they want to crack a good joke at somebody's expense?\n    The radio sent by the two Germans and the Irishman who recently flew from Ireland and landed at Greenly island shows plainly that some other racial groups like chicken as well as our own. After these men who were marooned on the icebound rock of that bleak coast had radioed a message asking for spare parts with which to repair their partly wrecked plane, the Bremen,  they sent this postscript: \"Add chicken prepared if possible.\" So the Irish and the Germans like chicken as well as ourselves, it seems. That old chicken joke about our Race is like the one about watermelons. According to some people, our group is the only one which cares about that luscious fruit. And yet acres of watermelons are grown every year and sent to some part of the country where very few if any Race people live and they on menus of hotels in which our group cannot be served at all. But again I ask, What do people care about facts when they want to crack their little pet jokes? The fallacy about chickens and watermelons with reference to our group is like the one about flat feet. It is generally believed that nobody but Colored people have flat feet. Everybody, ourselves included, has accepted that as a well established fact. And yet during the World war it was discovered that this is another weakness imputed to the Race which has no foundation in fact. It was shown by Dr. Isaac Brewer of the medical reserve corps that among white men the rate per 1,000 rejected on account of flat fett was 55.7, while among our men the rate rejected for the same cause was only 44.8. In other words, among every 1,000 white men there were nearly 11 per cent more rejected on account of flat feet than among the same number of Race men. But in spite of these authentic figures there are many who still belive that \"the Negro and flat feet are synonymous.\"\n***\n    The Daughters of the Confederacy have been disporting themselves considerably in washington during the 37th congress of the  Daughters of the American Revolution. They have been wearing the insignia of the Confederacy beside that of the D. A. R. One of the officers of the latter organization rebuked the Daughters of the Confederacy for doing this, \"We are a body of united American women working for our country's good,\" she said, as she urged the women to wear but one emblem. But the honorary president general of the D. A. R. was just wasting her breath when she appealed to the Daughters of the Confederacy to discard their insignia. They glory in the \"lost cause.\" They never lose an opportunity of lauding their leaders to the skies and making small of the men who preserved the Union.\n    But the nation stands for it and so they go from one degree of arrogance to another. No country in the world would allow a group of citizens who tried to destroy it to go to such lengths as does this one. Since the dedication of the figure of Robert E. Lee in the giant Stone mountain Confederate memorial the newspapers in both South and North have torn passion to tatters doing homage to the man who fought to destroy this Union. It is the fashion to place Robert E. Lee at the head of the general who fought during the Civil war.\n   All sorts of fairy tales are told about his character. The one which delcares he \"was a great American fighting for his convictions\"  has absolutely no foundation in fact. Lee did not say believed it was right for him to raise his hand against his country. His letters state distinctly that he felt obliged to cast his lot with the Confederacy to save his property for his children. Everything he possessed, he said, we in the South, and he wanted to preserve his holdings for posterity. Lee himself did not claim that he was fighting against his country because he was impelled to do so on account of his \"convictions.\" \n   This gigantic bas relief on Stone mountain will include President Jefferson Davis. Lee, Jackson and Jefferson Davis willl be represented as \"leading a gray cavalcade, bare-headed, into eternity.\" One paper declares that the nation salutes this statue with pride and it will even salute the Stars and Bars which are fluttering figuratively over these three representatives of the lost cause. A great deal more of this kind of stuff has been poured out in laudation of Jefferson Davis and Lee. No good can come of it. The \"lost cause\" simply means that men were fighting to keep human beings in the most cruel slavery that the world has ever seen. There is no use trying to whitewash what the slaveholders were fighting to do. They wanted to keep the slaves.\n\n\n\nMay 19 - 1928\nUp to Date\nA Brief Survey of Current Happenings\nBy MARY CHURCH TERRELL\n     A German count has just told the American people that women will eventually run this government. He says that the men are growing more domestic than the woman and that the women have become pre-dominant since their \"emancipation.\" According to the count, men enslaved women by their physical prowess, because they realized that women were superior to them and they were afraid of them for that reason. But the count \"views with alarm\" this predominance of woman because man and woman together make up the unit of life. \"I wonder who first called woman the weaker sex?\" inquired the count. \"It must have been some shrewd and uncrupulous woman.\" We have one thing to comfort us when we observe how women are asserting themselves. They cannnot run the government any worse than the men have run it, no matter how hard they try.\n***\n     NOTHING shows more clearly how rapidly prejudice against our group is spreading than the positive refusal of a Canadian hotel to accommodate the secretaries of the Y. M. C. A. who were going to Toronto to attend the biennial convention which will be held there. Just a few years ago Canada was a haven of refuge for bondmen freeing from the most cruel slavery in the United States which the world has ever seen. And now that English possession is drawing the color line against us! But, of course, \"there's a reason.\" The Americans who are flocking there for booze are at the bottom of this discrimination against us. Wherever they go they insist that Colored people shall be granted none of the privileges which other people enjoy. They issue and ultimatum to those who do not understand the situation and who are willing to treat us like other human beings that if they do not draw the line against us they will lose the patronage of all respectable Americans. \n     A few years ago some prejudice-ridden people from the United States arose from the table immediately in a London hotel when some bishops of the A. M. E. church entered the dining room. The hotel proprietor refused to deny service to the Colored Americans and the irate guests left in high dudgeon. But, it is said, that after that incident Colored people were not accommodate in that hotel any more. A short while ago Jimmie Walker, mayor of New York, tried to induce the proprietor of a cabaret in Rome to eject some Colored people who were there, but he refused to do so. White Americans have tried over and over again to force the Frence to discriminate against dark people, but they have seldom succeeded in doing so. There is no doubt, however, all this childishness and nonsense displayed by the dominant race abroad make them appear ridiculous in the eyes for foreigners as a general rule. The Y. M. C. A. deserves commendation for deciding to meet in Pocono Manor, Pa., where all the secretaries will be treated alike. \n***\n     A PARIS newspaper has certainly undertaken a labor of love. It is really making a serious effort to solve the marriage problem for lonely men and women who have about given up all hope of finding mates. A feminist writer is in charge of this important work. She boasts that in four years she has arranged 60 marriages, \"none of them ending in divorce.\" She is about to extend her efforts by publishing brief unsigned statements from both men and women and then supervising their correspondence as well as she can. Well, why shouldn't she? Let the good work go on!\n***\n     WHEN Congressman Madden suddenly expired our people in the District of Columbia certainly lost a good friend. Since we are all disfranchised here it means a great deal to know that we have a friend in congress to whom we may go for protection and assistance when occasion requires. I was personally acquainted with Mr. Madden and knew that his heart was in the right place, so far as our people were concerned. Some of the strongest and finest statements in defense of the Race which have ever been made in congress when we have been assailed and attacked by enemies and detractors have been fearlessly uttered by Mr. Madden. May his soul rest in peace. Let us also express the hope that Illinois will send a man to fill the vacancy caused by Representative Madden's death who is just and courageous as the departed congressman was. \n***\n     EVERYBODY will be glad to know that a Colored woman who was serving a term of 10 years in the penitentiary for a crime which he did not commit will soon be released. The man who actually robbed the victim has confessed his guilt and was himself sentenced to a term of 10 years in the penitentiary. One dislikes to think of the large number of men sitting behind the bars in their cells who are innocent of the the crimes with which they have been charged. It is very easy to frame people and it is not hard to get witnesses to perjure themselves.\n     In that section where it is difficult for our group to get justice in the courts there is no doubt that hundreds of Colored men have been convicted and sentenced on perjured testimony. There is nothing our group needs more than competent upright lawyers capable of looking after the interestes of their clients.\n***\n     A DISTINGUISHED gentleman of the cloth predicts that the time is soon coming when the African loin cloth will be all the style in the United States and that the women will follow it. This prophesy was made in Baltimore by a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal church, South. You know, of course, that the curch of this denomination still clings to its southern traditions and refuses to merge with the Methodists in the North. There is no doubt, however, that good Bishop Denny could preach a rousing sermon on the text, \"Behold how good and how pleasant it is for breathren to dwell together in unity!\"\n     But to return to woman's styles. They worry the bishop quite some. \"I am fully aware,\" said he, \"that the Greek women were well draped below the waist and careless above. But the woman of the present-day have got the thing upside down. I was at Miami Beach recently,\" continued the bishop, wiping the tears from his eyes (perhaps), \"and I was so ashamed of the women there that I had to ask the men who took me to the place to drive me away. I don't she hwo the women do it.\" I've no doubt that as soon as those naughty women at Miami Beach learn they have shocked the good bishop of the Mehtodist Episcopal church, south,  they will right-about face, reverse the style and put on a proper, modest frocks which will make it possible for him to look at them without blushing. Perhaps if Bishop Denny would think about his duty to unite the church South and the church North and thus give sinner a fine example of how Christians can smooth out their little differences and dwell together in harmony instead of worrying his brain so much about the way women dress it would be better for him personally, for the church on general principles and for the women, too. \"Honi soit qui mal y pense\" is the way the French express a though which the good bishop would do well to ponder. Sometimes people who think evil see evil.\n***\n     IT was perfectly natural for Floyd Bennett's physician to send for serum from New York with which he was familiar in treating a patient who was ill unto death. But it is not hard to understand why the Canadian physicians felt it was a reflection upon them to ask New York to send serum to a patient who was ill in one of their hospitals. they have as much and as good serum as New York ever dared to have, they tell the world. The \"spat\" between the doctors of Canada and those of this country is like the quarrel between two children. Each can see only his side of the story and both are as mad as wet hens. But the cause of the trouble, that great, courageous airman how sacrified his life to aid two men from the country with which his own was waging war a few short years has gone to his long home. Peace to his ashes. Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friend.\n\nUp to Date\nMay 26, 1928\nBy MARY CHURCH TERRELL\n\nTHAT must have been a very interesting\nmeeting indeed which the\nAmerican Peace society celebrating\nits centennial recently held in Cleveland,\nOhio. There were three representatives\nof the nonwhite races - the\nJapanese, the Chinese and the Colored-American,\nand each made an\nappeal to the dominant race. The\nJapanese ambassador defended his\ncountry in referring to the conflict\nbetween Japan and China; the\nChinese representative begged the\nwestern world to be patient with\nChina while she is undergoing a revolution,\ntrying to establish an honest\ngovernment, abolish unjust treaties\nand rise to a higher moral plane.\nThen came the president of Howard\nuniversity, the eloquent, forceful,\ncourageous Dr. Mordecai Johnson,\nwho told the truth about white civilization\nand called a spade a spade.\nThe newspapers referred to it as \"an\nindictment of white civilization.\"\nWell, a rose by any other name would\nsmell as sweet. Dr. Johnson told the\ntruth. That is the point. He made\nmany people sit up and take notice\nwho have never before thought seriously\nabout the hard conditions which\nconfront Colored people in this country\nwhen he declared that his Race\nfaced the alternative of following\nsoviet Russia if the white man didi\nnot deal justly with the Negro. In\nreporting this speech, the white press\nof the country was as discourteous\nas it generally is when it refers to\nour group. It used a small \"n\" when\nwriting the word \"Negro\" instead of\na capital letter. It rarely misses a\nchance to give us a nasty little dig\nwhen it can. What good reason can \nthe white press assign for writing\nthe word \"Negro\" with a small letter\ninstead of a capital?\n\n* * *\n\nWHAT a pity it is that China and\nJapan are at swords' points with\neach other. It is heart-breaking to\nsee those colored races trying to destroy\neach other. What a wonderful\npower they would be if they could be\npersuaded to unite their forces instead\nof cutting each other to pieces.\nChina has a population of more than\n400,000,000 people and Japan has\n40,000,000. China is really  trying to \nestablish a republican form of government\nagainst tremendous odds and\nwhile she is rent and torn by civil\nwar, Japan steps in and commits\natrocities which the Chinese naturally\nresent. For instance, a group of\nJapanese soldiers recently attacked\nthe Chinese office of foreign affairs\nin Shantung, cut off the ears and \nnose of the commissioner and murdered\nevery member of his staff in\ncold blood. They committed many\ndepredations without justification or\ncause. Japan is doing everything she\ncan to trample Chinese sovereignty\nunder foot.\n     In spite of all this, however, one\ncannot help admiring Japan for the\nmarvelous progress she has made in\nlittle more than sixty years and for\nthe courage she displays. Many of\nus remember the marvelous victory\nshe achieved over Russia about\ntwenty-five years ago, when the odds\nwere all against her and all the white\nmilitary experts stated positively she\ncould not win the war. But she won\nit on land and sea. Then, too, it was\nexhilarating to see little Japan demanding\nrace equality at the peace\nconference in Paris after the World\nwar. She did not get it, of course.\nEngland and the United States, the\ntwo \"most Christian\" and highly civilized\nraces, did not grant it to her,\nbut she had self-respect and dignity\nand courage enough to fight for it\njust the same. Let us give that\nbrown race with its little men creidt\nfor that. At least the little brown\nJapanese gave the wor (?)\nto think about.\n     To return to China and her present\ndifficulties just a second. It is quite\npossible that Japan's violation of\nChinese sovereignty will cause the\nChinese to stop fighting each other,\nso as to unite their forces against\ntheir common foe. The Chinese general\ncommanding the northern forces\nhas ordered his soldiers to suspend\nhostilities against the troops in the\nsouth. If so, some kind of a union\nmay be effected which will end the\ncivil war in China. Everybody who\nloves his fellow man and longs for\nuniversal peace cannot help hoping\nthat out of so much evil some good\nmay come.\n \n* * *\n\nIT has been many a day since anybody\nhas heard a man get up and\nrelate to a congressional committee\nsuch a tale of political corruption and \nfraud as Charles E. Fox, former district\nattorney of Philadelphia, told\nhere a few days ago. It was hard to\nkeep from gasping when Mr. Fox\ncalmly testified about the frauds\nwhich he perpetrated in sex different\nPhiladelphia wards after the general\nelection in 1926. Voting officials\ncommitted these frauds at the behest\nof the \"organization,\" he said. The\nman who was named as the leader\nof all this corruption, Senator-elect\nWilliam S. Vare, sat as calm as a \ncucumber and listened to Mr. Fox go\ninto the disgusting particulars of all\nthis graft without batting an eyelash.\nAccording to Mr. Fox, ballot\nboxes were stuffed, people were\nfraudulently registered, votes counted\nilligally, tally sheets forged, men\nlong sing dead, men who had been\nbed-ridden for years, those who were\nlying flat on their backs in hospitals\non the days they were represented as\nhaving been at the polls and girls 10\nyears old were all recorded as voters\nand a great many other kinds of\nfraud perpetrated. It was shocking\nenough to learn that all this political\ncorruption occurred so recently as\n1926, but when Mr. Fox stated that\nto his certain knowledge there had\nnot been an honest election in Philadelphia\nduring the 25 years of his\npublic life, those present wondered\nwhether their senses were functioning\nproperly and they were hearing alright.\nAnd yet, there are many in the dominant\ngroup who have the ironclad\nnerve to point the finger of accusation\nand scorn at their less favored\nbrothers because of the latter's misdemeanors\nand mistakes! To quote\nthe Holy Scripture: \"Thou hypocrite,\nfirst cast out the beam out of thine\nown eye and then shalt thou see\nclearly to cast out the mote out of\nthy brother's eye.\"\n \n* * * \n\nWHAT a fine example the Italian,\nGeneral Umberto Nobile, has set!\nHe is going to the polar regions in a\ndirigible. Somebody asked him if he\nintended to hunt game while he was\non this trip. \"No indeed,\" he replied\nquickly, \"I am opposed in principle\nto killing animals. While I must\nconfess I am not a vegetarian, yet I\nthink it would be better if none of\nus ate food obtained by the taking\nof life. I wouldn't have the heart to\nkill anything. I am also hoping for\nthe day when life will be regarded\nso sacred that nobody will go to war.\nLet's cultivate kindness to animals\nand then we will refrain from taking\ntheir lives, even for the purpose of \ntaking nourishment. Once we are\nimbued with the consciousness of the\nsanctity of life we will also be a \nhuge step nearer to the elimination\nof wars.\" May a great man who\nwould not \"have the heart to kill\nanything\" live long to influence for\ngood his fellows.\n\nHOMELY PHILOSOPHY\nPAST MISTAKES\nBy GEORGIA DOUGLASS JOHNSON\n\n     Past mistakes - forget them. Let today be free and untrammeled\nby fretting over the wrongs of yesterday. Today has sufficient cares\nof its own without the added and unnecessary burdens of yesterday.\n     Each morning is a new and precious gift from God, unearned and\nfree. Shall we not walk through its length and unshadowed and undrooped\nby the mistakes of days gone by?", "52", 32, 32, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-024:00037", "14\nof human rights, electrified the whole civilized world and helped liberate \n4,000,000 slaves.\n\nThis very institution, which to so many of its students, has been a \nveritable oasis of opportunity in a dezert of ignorance and blight, is \na magnificent monument to the broad-mended, generous-hearted men and \nwomen by whom it was founded. Tho for many years after the war the scheme \nof giving the youth of the emancipated race a thorough, or what seem \nterm the higher education was regarded as little less than quixotic, to \nall predictions of failure, the founders of institutions like these \nturned a deaf ear. Better failure, they said, after Christian, humans \nefforts to uplift a heavily-handicapped and struggling race than a coward \nsubservience to the opinions of those who withhold from them encouragement \nand aid, because they take for granted the mental and spiritual incapacity \nof the race. And to day, the hundreds of men and women who have graduated \nfrom this institution, the thousands of men and women with whom they \nhave come into personal contact, whom they have elevated to a higher intellectual \nand spiritual plane rixe up and call the founders of this institution \nblessed.\n\nAnd so, one might go on, citing instance after instance to prove that \nthe real heroes and benefactors of mankind never allow themselves to be \ndeterred from undertaking what seems to them wise or good, the successful \ncompletion of which has been conceived by the human mind. Your George \nWashington's, Martin Luthers, Togos, Oyanas, Shermans Grants, Harriet \nBeecher Stowes, and all the others who have promoted the welfare of mankind, \neither by contributing to the sum of human knowledge or have been \nneither weak nor stupid enough to allow themselves to be deterred from \nundertaking that what seems to them wise or good, because their friends or \ntheir foes wearing brains dressed up in ready-made conclusions have told \nthem they could not succeed.\n\nAs has already been indicated Japan has recently aroused the world from \nthe ignorance and conceit which lead ot for hundreds of years to believe \nthat the color of the skin was either a measure of a race's intellectual \n\n\n15\ncapacity or a test of its military strength. For reason which will readily \noccur to some of you, I am sure, it may justly be claimed that the \nprogress of the Colored people in the United States has even exceeded \nthat made by Japan.\n\n   In spite of obstacles almost insurmountable and opposition relentless \nthe Colored American has made such progress in education, industry, finance \nand trade as has never been made in the same length of time under \nsuch discouraging circumstances by any race of people in the world. \nAnd yet, at the close of the War, if anybody had dared to predict the \nmarvellous progress along financial all lines of human endeavor which Colored \nwould make in this short space of fifty years, he would either have \nbeen laughed out of Court or adjudged insane.\n\nAs wonderful and as creditable as has been our progress, however, we are \nstill leagues and leagues from our goal. During the forty years before us \nour strides toward the highest, best civilization should be much faster \nand longer than have been those during the fifty years just passed. \nBut, it would be foolhardy for us to take for granted the success wo \nhave not yet attained as it would be silly to take for granted the defeat \nwe have not yet sustained. Therefore, let me beseech of you, young \nmen and women to quit you like women and men.

Skirts will \nnot be any longer, as it was predicted\nthey would be a few months ago.\nOne Parisian designer has actually\nshow skirts even a little shorter \nthan they have ever been before.\nThere is one consolation in this bit\nof new, however.  He can't possibly\nmake the skirts much shorter than\nsome of them have been and have\nany skirt left at all!  Some of the\nnew models \"are lifted well above the\nkneecaps in front,\" we are told, \"and\ncome only an inch below the knee \ncurve in the back.\"  There will always\nbe human beings, men as well \nas women, who are willing to make\nthemselves ridiculous by going to extremes\nin following any fashion.\nWhen dresses were long, women appeared\nin public streets wearing \ntrains which swept up all the dirt\nand collected all the germs they could\ncorral.  There is no telling how many\ncases of tuberculosis, diphtheria and\nother germ diseases were unwittingly \nbrought into homes all over the country\nby the long trains which women\nthen wore.  There is no doubt whatever\nthat many a child for whom the\nmother would have given her own life\nif she could have saved it died a victim\nto those dirty-carrying, germ-dispensing\nlong trails.  The short\nskirt is a great improvement on those\nold disease-breeding street-sweepers\nwhich women used to wear.  Just as \nsome women wore their skirts too\nlong in \"those good old days,\" so\nsome of the sex will persist in wearing\nthem too short today.  There's\nno use getting excited about it.  The\nmen and women who go to extremes\nin everything will probably always\nbe with us till the end of time.  Instead\nof getting all het up about the\nbrevity of the present skirt, let us\nbe thankful for the blessings we have\nand rejoice that women are not fetching\ngerms into their homes via long\ntrains any more.\n*  *  *  \nDID you think much about \"Be\nKind to Animals week\" which\nwas recently observed?  Most of us\nshould have paid more attention to\nit than we probably did.  It was the \nweek in which all of us were supposed\nto use our influence in behalf\nof our dear dumb friends, who are\noften so cruelly mistreated and\nabused.  Comparatively little was said\nabout it in the newspapers and the\nefforts to impress its meaning upon\nthe public were comparatively few.\nHere and there ministers preached\nsermons upon man's duty to be\nmerciful to animals and exercises\nwere held in some of the public\nschools.  But much more publicity\nshould have been given to the significance\nof the week than it received.\nMany are unkind to animals without\nrealizing they are cruel and without\nintending to be.  Dogs, cats, birds\nand horses suffer terribly for water,\nparticularly in the hot summer time.\nTheir owners forget to give them\nboth water and food.  Both dogs and\nhorses are tied in the hot sun and\nare needlessly exposed to rain, cold\nand snow.\nParents who love their children and\nwant them to become decent men and\nwomen should try especially to teach\nthem to be kind to animals.  If they\nallow them to abuse dumb creatures\nwithout making an effort to show\nthem how cruel they are they are\ndoing their children a great injustice.\nThey are allowing them to cultivate\nqualities which may lead to their\nruin.\nA few years ago the life history of\nthe en who were in the prisons of\nScotland for murder was investigated\nand in every instance it was discovered \nthat when they were boys they\nhad been noted for their cruelty to\nanimals.\nHorses fret and are restless because\nthey are in pain.  Drivers saw \n\nthe iron bit into the raw flesh.  The\nhorse's bellyband or the checkrein\nmay be too tight.  The man who delivers\nour coal does not detach the\ncollar from the rest of the harness\nand it remains immovable while the\npoor horse pulls and tugs and works.\nIt is amazing to see how many\nthings are done by presumably good\npeople to torture animals.  An Englishman\nwho was traveling through \nthe United States a short while ago\nsaid he was surprised to see how\nmany animals were held in captivity\nin the United States.\nThere is no trait in our character\nwhich needs to be developed more\nthan the one which prompts us to\nbe kind to animals.  The Society for \nthe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals \nhas done a great deal to protect the,\nbut much remains to be done.  As\none passes along the street it is no\nuncommon sight to see men beating\ntheir horses because the poor animals\nhave not the strength to pull \nthe heavy loads imposed upon them.\nSometimes a word of remonstrance\ngiven with politeness and tact may\ncause the driver to desist from such\ncruelty.  At any rate, it is the duty\nof all of us who want to do right and\nbe good citizens to strive earnestly\nand actively to protect all animals\nas much as we can.  One of the\nthings we can all do is to persuade\nmothers that it is not cute in their\nchildren to pull a cat's tail or to tie\na tin can to a dog's tail to scare him\nto death and see him run till he falls\nfrom exhaustion.\n*  *  *  \nEACH and every one of us here in\nWashington is waiting with bated\nbreath and on the tiptoe of expectation\nto see whom Chicago is going\nto send to represent us in congress.\nHe will be received with open arms!\nIt has been 27 years since we have\nhad a representative in congress.  It\nwas predicted when George H.\nWhite's term expired--March, 1901--\nthat it would be a long time before\nwe should see his like again in the\nhouse of representatives.\nThanks to the disfranchisement in\nthe southern states and to our own\nfailure to stick together in the\nnorthern states that dire prediction \nhas been fulfilled to the letter.  In\nselecting the late Congressman Madden's \nsuccessor Chicago has a fine\nchance to show the rest of us how\nto use the political power we possess\nin the North.  Good luck to Chicago! \nIt is a crying shame that there is\nnot a single, solitary man in the congress\nof the \"greatest republic on\nearth\" to represent from 12,000,000\nto 15,000,000 citizens who have made\nvaluable contributions to its material\nwelfare and who have proved their\nloyalty again and again.  Chicago\nwill come to our rescue--we hope.\n*  *  *  \nDON'T say there is nothing new\nunder the sun, for there is!  If\nthe plan to give a British lord a\ncertain present is carried out, there\nwill be something in this world different\nfrom anything in the heavens\nabove, in the earth beneath or in the\nwaters under the earth.  It will be an\nautomobile which will cost $200,000.\nIt will have a chassis of pure silver\nand the body thereof will be covered\nwith hammered gold.  There will be\na solid gold motto on the radiator,\n\"Veritas vincit,\" which means \"truth\nconquers.\"  An automobile manufacturer\nof Hungary will give this\nluxurious car to Lord Rothmere to\nexpress the gratitude of the people\nfor the work he did in revising a\ntreaty which restores to his country\ncertain territories.  Well may the\nEnglishman exclaim, \"Deliver me\nfrom my friends.\"  What a wretched \nman he will be, harassed continuously\nby the thought that both he\nhimself and his wonder car are always\nin danger.  The day he comes\ninto possession of that automobile he\nwill literally have an elephant on his\nhands and his peace of mind will\nbe destroyed until he is relieved of it.\n\nHOMELY PHILOSOPHY\nMAKE OPPORTUNITIES\nBy GEORGIA DOUGLASS JOHNSON \n\nWhile we wait for opportunities life rushes by, passes and is gone.\nLet us make opportunities.  Whether it be love, fame or fortune that\nis desired, put into motion those forces that will open the door to\nthese avenues.\nHe who abjectly sits listlessly awaiting some strange chance to bring\ngolden keys to serve him will wait in vain.\nLet us bestir ourselves, throw off the legarthy of indolence and \nmake opportunities. \n\n\nUp to Date\nA Brief Survey of\nCurrent Happenings\n[* June 7-1928 *]\nBy MARY CHURCH TERRELL \n\nFOR the first time in the history\nof this country a debate between\nthe students of one of our universities\nand those of a white institution\nhas been held in the national\ncapital.  Two students from Howard\nuniversity recently argued with two\nfrom Northwestern university on the\nquestion, \"Resolved, That the Baumes\nAct of New York Be Enacted in the\nSeveral States.\"  A short time ago\nthe students from Northwestern intended\nto debate with those of Shaw\nuniversity in Raleigh, N. C., but that\nportion of the South immediately\nconcerned objected so strenuously to\nhaving white students debate with\nthose from one of our schools in\ntheir neck of the woods that it was\ncalled off.\nWhen they finally came together\nhere, however, it was delightful to see \nthe fine spirit of comradeship which\neach displayed toward the other.\nThe first speaker from Northwestern\nstarted off by thanking the Howard \nstudents for the generous courtesy\nwhich had been shown them since\nthey had arrived.  He told them that\nboth he and his comrade appreciated\nit and hoped some day the Howard\nstudents would come to Northwestern\nso that they might reciprocate. \nIf the problems of this earth can\never be solved it will certainly be\nthrough the youth.  There is nothing\nwhich inspires one with hope so\nmuch as the youth movement which\nis waxing stronger and bigger all\nover the civilized world.  It is said\nthat no one under 25 was responsible\nfor the World war.  It was the\nmiddle-aged and old sinners who\nbrought that unspeakable horror\nupon the earth.  The young people \nare beginning to feel that they have\na right to change the old order of\nthings which causes so much unnecessary\nsuffering and is at the bottom\nof so much injustice.\nNot long ago some people paraded\nin front of the White House, carrying\nbanners protesting against keeping\nthe marines in Nicaragua.  They\nare tired of seeing the great, bit\nUnited States bulldoze the small\ncountries.  Perhaps some of those\nyoung people have heard about the\nbrutal manner in which the marines\ntreated the Haitians, particularly the\nwomen.\nNow that the students of one white\ncollege have treated our young men\nwith the same courtesy which they\nwould show those of their own group,,\nthere will be more of this comradeship\nbetween them.  There is only \none way to solve the problem in this\ncountry, and that is through the\nyouth.\n*  *  *  \nENGLAND is still playing the role\nof tyrant, as she has been doing\nfor centuries.  She is accustomed to\nkeep those over whom she rules in\ncomplete subjection, so that she can\nextract from them the last penny she\ncan purloin.  Several years ago Ireland\ngained her independence after\nstruggling and suffering for it 700 \nyears.  This time it is Egypt she is\nthreatening.  After keeping Egypt as\na British protectorate for eight years,\nEngland declared in 1922 that this\nprotectorate had ended and that\nEgypt, which was formerly held by\nTurkey, would henceforth be an independent,\nsovereign state.  Of course,\nthis so-called independency had several \nbig, strong strings tied to it.  It\nwouldn't be England's way of behaving,\nif there hadn't been.\nRecently a bill was introduced\ninto the Egyptian legislature which\nprovided that no steps should be\ntaken against disorders in public\nassemblies except at the request of\nthe Egyptian organizers of the meeting,\nor unless disorders actually occurred\nand that the England policemen\nwho violated this provision\nshould be punished.  Ttis bill was\npassed by the Egyptian chamber,\nwhich correspondence with our congress.\nEngland then insisted that this bill \nshould be withdrawn by the Egyptian\nlegislature, because she wants her\nsnoopers to spy on all the gatherings\nthe natives have.  But nationalist\nfeeling runs high in Egypt and the\nEgyptian parliament refused to withdraw \n\nthe bill.  Then England gave\nEgypt 48 hours in which to comply \nwith this demand.  Two battleships\nand three cruisers were immediately\ndispatched to Egypt to intimidate\nher.  England felt certain that when\nthis fleet reached Alexandria, the\ngovernment of Cairo would yield to\nher demand. \nThen Egypt displayed good, hard\ncommon sense by making a compromise.\nShe declared that although\nGreat Britain had no right to interfere \nwith legislation in the Egyptian\nparliament, for the sake of harmony \nand to give time to adjust the\nmatter more satisfactorily the measure \nwould be postponed until November.\nWhile this disposition of the\nmatter does not satisfy anybody, it\nis better than having an open break\nat present.  The Egyptians will never\nbe satisfied with anything less than\ncomplete independence without any\nreservation whatsoever.  But it would\nbe silly for them to run the risk of\nlosing what they already possess by\nasserting themselves too vigorously\njust now.\nGreat Britain says she will retain\ncontrol over the Suez canal at all\ncosts and that the meetings which\nare being held inspire the Egyptians\nwith the desire for complete independence\nwhich she cannot grant.\nFor that reason the assemblies bill\nwhich is designed to prevent the\nBritish police from interfering with\nEgyptian meetings must not be\npassed.  Great Britain is the arch-robber\nof the world.  She has done\nnothing but gobble up dark people\nand their lands for years.  She keeps\nthe iron  heel of oppression upon \nswarming millions in India today.\nShe has a lot to answer for and if\nthere is anything like divine justice,\nwhich there certainly is, she will \nsurely get hers some day.\n*  *  *  \nHERE is something for women to\nget excited about sure enough.\nA lady by the name of Batt declares\nthat she has been to a far country\nwhere old grandmothers retain their\nyouth so long it is hard to distinguish\nthem from the young matrons.  They\nlive to be 100 years old and older\nwithout having a single wrinkle or a\nsolitary gray hair, she claims.  But\nthe trouble is Miss Batt is unable to\ntell us just where we can find this\npromised land.  All she says is that\nthis heaven on earth is \"hidden in\nhigh Himalayan villages\" somewhere \nin the world.  She traveled without\na map and without any knowledge\nof the route she took, consequently \nthose of us who would like to go\nthere do not know for what city to\nbuy a ticket.  The secret of this semi-perpetual\nyouth, declares Miss Batt,\nis due to a mysterious brew which\nis made from mountain herbs and\nwhich does not intoxicate, although\nit adds great vitality to the body.\nThis is their only drink except water.\nThen, too, they eat only one kind of\nfood at a meal.  The Brahmin priests\nwith whom the lady talked told her\nthey were in constant telepathic communication\nwith the \"masters of the\nHimalayas.\"  She claims also that\nthese strange people told her of \nevents transpiring in her English\nhome which checked to the minute\nwhen she compared them.  Miss Batt\ntravels dressed as a man, which \nenables her to go where women would \nbe barred.  But think of a woman\nactually being in a place where she\ncould live to be 100 years old and\nlook as young as a flapper and not\nstaying there!  Can you imagine it?\n*  *  *  \nJUST why Representative Welch of\nCalifornia has introduced a bill to\namend the 1924 immigration act to\nexclude citizens of the Philippines \nfrom the United States is hard to\nsay, unless it is due to the everlasting\ncolorphobia which is so prevalent\nin the United States.  He\nwants the word \"alien\" to include\ncitizens of the Philippines.  Since\nthe United States has taken the\nisland under its wing, it seems like\nturning a cold shoulder on a member \nof one's own family to shut the door \nin the Filipino's face.\n\n", "54", 31, 31, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-021:00042", "18\npeople upon the face of the globe can arouse the sympathy and fire the\nindignation of the American public at the present time quicker than an\naccount[s] of the murderous assaults upon the blacks of the South which are occuring\n[comparatively common occurrence.] almost every day. [*End*]\nMany faults are laid at the Negro's door, but perhaps none is charged\nagainst him with more force and less truth than that he is idle and will\nnot work. It is impossible to name any race every member of which is thrifty\nand industrious. There are doubtless negroes here and there who do not\nexert themselves much, and who are afflicted with a chronic case of laziness,\nand there are white men who are scourged with the same disease. [*from which\nincurable disease white men have also been known to suffer]\nThe majority of Negroes, however, are willing and anxious to work. In many\ncases it is impossible for them to get work to do. Every body knows that\nthe labor unions are not especially friendly to the Negro, to say the very\nleast [*The [labor] obviate of the various organizations*] . No matter how competent or desirable a Negro may be as a clerk or\na stenographer in a store, and when we learn the trades to see how or business house of any knid, it is next to \nimpossible for hin to secure a position of this kind.  And if, by chance, he\nslips in like a thief in the night, as I were, in ninety nine cases in a \nhundred he is dsicharged, if his race is detected, In many sections of\nthis country it would be easier for a leper to secure employment in a number\nof occupations than it would be for a man or woman who was known to\nhave a drop of African blood in his or her veins. If there were time, I \nciuld cases which have come under my own observation, to prove that even\nwhen negroes have by chance secured desirable positions and have given\npperfect satisfaction according to the testimony of their employers, they\nhave been promptly discharged, when it was discovered that they were even\nremotely connected with the oppressed and struggling race. It is not an\nuncommon occurrence for colored workmen to be thrown out of employment\nbecause first one group of white workmen and then another lays down their\ntools, go to the proprietor of the establishment with fire in their\n\n\n\n19\neye and fury in their tongue and insist upon having the black men discharged.\nIn Chattanooga Tenn., last April for instance I500 moulders of the\nRoss Mahan works, the Cahill Iron Works, the Chattanooga Car and Foundry\nCo. and the Montague Soil Pipe Works all shot up shop, because negro\nlaborers had been employed. Last August the American Iron and Steel\nManufacturing Co. sent a committee to the owners of the plant to say that if\nthe 300 colored workmen who had been employed, were not discharged, they\nall strike [white men would levae to a man.] The demand was not acceded to. Whereupon \nevery one of the I800 white workmen left the big plant [to a man], and as \nthey filed out, each man bore in his had a small American flag.\nWas ever this emblem more sacriligiously used? Was there ever a greater\ntravesty upon the flag of a nation which promises life, liberty and the\npursuit of happiness to even [its] humblest and poorest man [citizen]?\nBut the strikers did not object to the colored workmen, because of their\nrace, but because they did not belong to the union. Even if that were true\nit would have amounted practically to an objection on account of [the] color,\nsince colored men are not allowed to join that union. But as a matter\nof fact the committee who acted as spokesmen for the I800 workmen who struck\npprotrsted against the retention of the colored men, not because they were\nnon union men, because they were negroes. More than once in recent years\nhave colored men lost their lives in an attempt to earn an honest living\nand to put bread into the hungry mouths of wife and child.\nIn the South the negro is employed as a laborer more generally than he\nis in the North. But the ease with which he can secure employment there \nis more than offset by the poor wages he receives, the difficulty of collecting\nwhat is promised him and the various tricks used by unscrupulous\nemployers to defraud the ignorant negroes out of the money they honestly\nearn. [*Begin*] As incredible as it may seem many negroes are practically in\nslavery yet. About a year ago the murder of a negro in Anderson Co. S.C.\nrevealed the fact that a labor contract system which has been in vogue", "17", 29, 29, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00586", "[*June 23 - 1928*]\nUp to Date \nBy MARY CHURCH TERRELL \nA Brief Survey of \nCurrent Happenings \n\nTWO women have recently been \nadmitted to practice before the \nUnited States supreme court. One \nof them is only 30 years old and is \nsaid to be the youngest who has ever \nreceived the coveted honor. It looks \nas though the prediction which has \nrecently been made by a Japanese \nartist may come true, if the men don't \nlook out. Within 20 years, he says, \nhumanity will be dominated by \nwomen and a new era in the world's \nhistory will have begun. \"Women,\" \nsaid he, \"hold the sweetness and \nhoney of life and true happiness can \ncome only through their ascendancy.\" \nThe warlike nations and those who \nbelieve too much in material success \nunderrate women, he says, but \nwomen are the true upholders of \ncivilization, His predictions are \nbased on the sacred writings of \nJapan, the artist declares. These \nsay the first evidence of the new era \nwill begin about 1935 or 1936 and \nend in some big event in 1947. Poor \nmen! Their doom is sealed, if our \nJapanese friend is any kind of a \nprophet. It is too bad, but they have \nstrutted about the world, monarchs \nof all they surveyed, for a long, long \ntime. Now we see their finish, however.\nThere is only hope for them. \nMaybe the Japanese artist is mistaken.\nHe is a bit biased in favor of \nwomen at present. And there is a \nreason. He is heels over head in \nlove with an American girl whom he \nexpects to marry soon. When men \nhave been badly wounded by Cupid's \narrows they are liable to say any \nold thing. \n\n*   *   *\nLET us rejoice that Anton Bast, \nwho was unfrocked as a bishop \nof the Methodist Episcopal church \nat the recent meeting in Kansas City \nhailed from Copenhagen instead of \nAfrica and had no African blood in \nhis veins. That does not mean, of \ncourse, that anybody should rejoice \nthat such a tragedy overtook the representative \nof Denmark. It is unfortunate \nthat any man who occupies \na high position in the church should \nbe found guilty of misconduct with a \nwoman and of falsifying about money \nmade in publishing a paper, declaring \nthat he was losing in the venture, \nwhereas he was issuing it at a profit. \nBut, in this country where the faults \nof one group are often greatly exaggerated \nand given unnecessary \npublicity, while those of another are \napt to be minimized and scarcely \nnoticed, it is natural for the victims \nof such discrimination to be glad that \none of their number did not commit \nan unusually disgraceful deed. Although \ntwo whole weeks were spent \nin thoroughly sifting the charges \nagainst the bishop, and unusual care \nwas taken that he should not be \naccused of anything which was not \ndefinitely proved, the good bishop\nstoutly maintains that he is innocent,\ninsists that he still has his religion\nleft to him and intends to preach\nthe gospel. Since the church will\nallow him to do that, there is no reason\nin the world why the ex-bishop\nshould not continue to expound the\ndoctrine, if he can get enough people\nto listen to him and follow him.\n     There is such a slight line of demarcation\nbetween Christians and sinners\nthese degenerate days it is almost\ninvisible to the naked eye.\n . . .\nThe Atlanta Woman's club is split\ninto two rival factions and is having\none of the Aunt Dolly's times. What\nthe members want to know is who is\npresident and who isn't? One of the\nclaimants to the presidency has obtained\nan order from judge of the\nFulton superior court restraining the\nother woman, who insists she was\nelected, from interfering with the\nmanagement of the club. Things got\nso hot and unruly at a recent meeting\npolicemen had to be brought in to\nmaintain order. The lady who tells\nthe world she is president - any\nstatment to the contrary notwithstanding-\ndeclares that after she was\nelected to that exalted office a faction\nwho wanted her rival held a\nmeeting after the regular one had adjourned \nand voted the other woman\nin.\n     Since all this concerns the ladies\nof the dominant race, there is no reason\nwhy we should lie awake nights\ngriveing over it. But can you not\nimagine how much fun would be\npoked at women who do not belong\nto the superior group and how much\nprinter's ink would be spilled in\nsarcastic references to their lawlessness\nand lack of self-control, if they\nhad made such a holy show of themselves\nin Georgia?\n . . .\nIt may surprise some people to\nknow that congress has passed a\nbill which forces the citizens of the\nnational capital to pay a large sum\nof money for the upkeep of the government\nwhich it should bear itself.\nThe sum appropriated by congress\nforces the citizens of the District of\nColumbia to pay practically 75 percent\nof the expense, whereas an honest,\nfair levy upon them would be\nonly 50 per cent. The citizens were\nwilling, however, to pay 60 per cent\nof the cost of maintaining the District\ngovernment, if congress refused\nto divide the expense evenly. The\nUnited States is now shifting upon\nprivate citizens the burden of paying\nfor services rendered the national\ngovernment, such as police and fire\nprotection, lighting, sewer service,\ntraffic regulation, street paving and\ncleaning and many other items on\nthe expense bill. Most people believe\nthat the citizens of the national\ncapital are to be envied, because\nthey pay lower taxes than are levied\nin other cities. But they do not know\nthe facts. With few exceptions the\ntaxpayers here pay more than do\nthose of other cities. The government\nis continually taking over large plots\nof ground upon which federal buildings\nare to be erected and withdrawing\nthem from taxation. The taxes\nwhich the citizens of the District are\nobliged to pay, therefore, are mounting\nhigher and higher every day. The\naction which has just been taken by\ncongress in refusing to allow the government\nto pay its rightful share of\nthe expense will react most unfavorably\nupon Washington. It will be\nimpossible to build new schools,\nwhich are sorely needed, and it will\nbe impossible to make many improvements\nwhich the citizens greatly \ndesire. By all manner of means\nthe national capital should be a perfect\nparagon of cities and should not\nbe hindered in its growth by politicians\nwho are not equal to the task\nwhich they have assumed. In order\nthus to embarrass and handicap those\nwho are eager to make Washington\nwhat it should be, Congress has deliberately\nset aside a law which was\npassed in 1922, by which it was explicitly \nprovided that the federal government\nshould bear 40 per cent of\nthe expense. There is no use talking\nabout the lawlessness of criminals\nand gangsters when the men\nwho are employed to make the laws\nof the country set such bad examples\nthemselves.\n . . .\n\nThe wonderful little airplane in\nwhich Col. Charles Lindbergh\nflew across the Atlantic ocean last\nMay can now be seen in the Smithsonian\ninstitution here. It has been\nsuspended nine feet above the floor,\nbut a platform has been erected so\nthat visitors may look into the cockpit\nof the plane. So the faithful little\nairship which bore its wonderful\nyoung pilot 40,000 miles, has taken\nits place among other historical relics,\nnever to fly again. It is possible\nto wax quite sentimental when one\nsees a machine which might perform\nmany other feats as successfully as\nthose which it has already performed\nbeing put entirely out of commission\nand doomed to everlasting inactivity\nand rest.

Investigate his progress in finance and trade,\nso far as he has been able to go. Recall the many proofs he has given\nof the highest, purest patriotism, Behold on all sides examples of irreproachable\ncitizenship unto which thousands of Colored people have attained,\nand surely no honest person will claim that the sacrifices made\nand the money expended in the Colored man's behalf have all been in vain.\nFor fifty years the Colored-American has been inching along like the\npo inch worm, as the Jubilee song expresses it, hoping to make himself\nworthy of the respect and consideration of that race whose good opinion\nand good wishes he so earnestly desires. At the close of the War, the Colored\nperson who could read was the exception and not the rule, and those\nwho had been taught had received instruction in defiance of the law.\nIn less than fifty years illiteracy among Coloredo Americans had been reduced\nto 33% and most of that intellectual progress had been made in\nthe South, where the majority of Colored people live.\nComparisons are always odious, I know, but in order to get as\nclose to the facts as possible, let us institute a comparison made by the\nColored people of the South and that made by the white people of that\nsection. And for fear that you may think that I am biased in favor of my\nown let me quote from the tlanta Ga. Constitution, one of the most reliable\nnewspapers in the country.

He stressed the\nanomaly of the United States' action \nin closing the American market to\nall foreign competitors \"and yet attempting\nto capture foreign markets\nfor American business men.\" \n\"This is not a policy of international\nco-operation.\" Dr. Buell remarked.\n\"It is a policy of attempted \ndomination.  Liberia is a good example\nof this policy.  Our officials\nfrankly told Liberia that if she\nwishes American help against a peril,\nwhich may have been real or imaginary,\nshe must accept a scheme\nwhich the secretary of commerce was\nsponsoring and which would work to\nthe benefit of the American manufacturer.\nThe state department gladly\naccepted obligations which may\nsooner or later make Liberia into another\nHaiti or Nicaragua.\nCALL RUBBER CONTRACT\nSECRET DIPLOMACY\nThe American congress of the\nAmerican people knew nothing about\nit.

S. DENIES CHARGE\nWashington. -- The state department\nofficials denied the charges\nmade by Raymond Leslie Buell that\nthe United States has established a\ntrade imperialism in Liberia.  The\nstate department asserted that it was\nnot consulted about the Firestone\nlease until shortly before the contract\nwas concluded.  Noting that the\nlease was for 99 years, the department\nsuggested to the Liberian government\nthat it might well be modified\nto provide for a 50-year lease\nwith the privileges of renewal thereafter \nfor five or ten-year periods.\nThe suggestion was rejected by the\nLiberian government and the state\ndepartment washed its hands of the\naffair.\nThe department's only connection\nwith the loan phase of the contract \nwas to say that from a standpoint\nof national policy there was no objection\nto the advance, and it was\npointed out in the department that\nat the time Liberia could not have\nhoped to secure a $5,000,000 loan in\nany other country at less than 7 per\ncent interest, while Firestone negotiated\nthe loan on a 5 per cent basis.\nIt was emphatically asserted in the\ndepartment that neither the United\nStates government nor that of Liberia\nwas interfering in any way with the\nacquisition of land in the latter country\nby foreign nationals.\n_____\nAfricans Learn Gospel\nFrom Chanting Songs\nNew York.--\"Music has become\nthe greatest medium of evangelism\nin Africa, the teaching of the gospel\nin song is easily done in a country\nwhere the people center their lives\nin rhythm,\" recently stated Rev.

First is the display\nof two large American flags in the\nparlor, second is the fact a table in\nthe center of the floor holds simply \na heavy Bible and last is the fact\nthat the home is well furnished and\nclean.  Far different is this home from\nthe lowly plantation hut in Dixie\nwhich witnessed the birth of Henry\nThomas into the chains of slavery.\nOf his early life in the Southland,\nMr. Thomas remembers but little.  He\ndoes say that the misery of the slave\nof the period never has left his mind.\nChained together for punishment,\nwhipped, worked long hours under\nthe broiling sun and steaming marshes\nof Louisiana, chased like wild\nbeasts by bloodhounds, and ignorant\nand superstitious, the slave yet found\ntime for the worship of his master's\nGod and in such a condition originated\nmany of the weirdly haunting\nmelodies now famed as \"spirituals.\"\nFor the southerners of the present, it\nis to be feared the ex-slave has slight\nrespect.  He recalls that in the old\ndays the slaves \"were well-behaved\nand did not fight among themselves.\"\nHis sage observance of interracial\nrelations is that if a man attends\nto his own business and practices\nthe Golden Rule he will be treated\nright.\"\nJOINS ARMY AFTER\nFREED BY SOLDIERS\nAt the time of General Banks'\nmarch to the sea, Henry says slaves\nset free by the advancing Union\narmy were urged to join the armed\nforces of the United States.  He was \nuniformed with the Ninth Louisiana\nand being too young to shoulder a\nmusket, was regimental drummer. \n\"Were not the slaves afraid to turn\nand fight their ex-masters?\" he was \nasked.\n\"They were glad to fight the men\nwho had whipped them and don't \nyou think those boys couldn't fight,\"\nMr. Thomas answered.  It may be\nthat the slaves could not shoot, but\nas Mr. Thomas says cold steel was\ntheir favorite when 20,000 enraged\nex-slaves charged behind a bristling\nbarracade of flashing bayonets,\n\"somebody just had to run.\"\nShortly before the close of the war\nThomas was brought North with\nLieut.

A few years ago John L. Sullivan, the famous pugilist was one a bright and shing star among the footlight favorites of the day. In a revival of Uncle Tom's Cabin a few years ago it was quite natural that Peter Jackson, the Colored prize-fighter should have been asked to tale the role of Uncle Tom. The audience which greeted Bill Nye was so small that he decided to postpone the lecture and go to hear Peter Jackson talk a out the pearly gates to little Eva. After the play a friend met Bill Nye in the lobby. \"Hello, Bill\", said he, what did you think of Peter Jackson?\" Well replied Nye, dryly, \"anatomically he was great, but \"Uncle Tomically, he was about the worst I ever saw.\" And so it is with some of our former friends, they have evidently reached the conclusion that years ago, under the regime of slavery way down South we were all right, but at the present, nface to face, in the role of full-fledged American citizens we are about the worst they ever saw.\nThat is the way with Colored people I fancy I hear somebody say. They are always whining and complaining about something. This country has done enough for the Colored man, let him shift for himself now. In Titus Andonicus Shakespeare tells a pitiful story of a beautiful young maid whose hands were cut off and whose tongue was cut out. And after the miscreants had maimed her thus they taunted her, saying \"Go, tell who cut out thy tongue, and if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe, write down thy mind.\" I sometimes think that the condition of the Colored-American now is quite similar to that of this unfortunate maid. With the ears of the public deaf to his cry for justice , and deaf to his appeal to be given an equal chance along with others, has not his tongue practically been cut out? And if the press in reflecting public opinion and catering to public taste refuses to permit its columns to be the vehicle thru which the Colored American may express his woes and his wrongs, what good does it to him, pray, if he does play the scribe and write down his mind? And when he tries to secure employment he is cold-bloodedly told that No Blacks need apply, has not this cruel race prejudice\n\n\n\n7\npractically cut off his hands?\nWhile photo-plays like the Birth of the Nation and other instrumentalitie.\nare used to create sentiment against the Colored-American, it is almost\nimpossible to secure an opportunity to present anything in the Colored\nman's behalf. Next to the Colored man who tries to arouse the conscience\nof this nation to the injustice perpetrated upon 10,000,000 of his\npeople, the most unpopular man at present, perhaps, is the occasional\nwhite man who insists upon pleading his Colored brother's cause. The similarity\nbetween the race problem, as it presents itself at the present\ntime and the question of slavery before the War is very striking indeed.\nThere are to day, as  there were then thousands of men and women whose\nvery souls cry out against the injustice of which Colored-Americans are\nthe victims. But, so unpopular has it become to array the various kinds\nof injustice of which Colored people are the victims before the public\nand to arraign those who instigate and perpetrate them that only those who\nhave the blood of the martyr flowing thru their veins have the courage\nto attack them.\n     At the close of the War, if an abolitionist or a union soldier had\nbeen told that in less than forty years, much of the work which it cost\nmillions of treasure and rivers of blood to accomplish would be practically\nundone in a large section of the United States, he would have dismissed\nsuch a prediction as to ridiculous and impossible to discuss. And yet,\nthat is precisely what has happened. The constitutional amendments which\nconferred the elective franchise upon the Colored-American are to day, as\nthey have been for years practically a dead letter in every State in a\nlarge section of this Republic. And, if one dares call attention to\nthese illegal practices, he is accused of waving the bloody shirt and of\nstirring up sectional strife, than which nothing could be more criminal.\nPublic wrath is no longer turned against the sinner, if you please, but\nagainst those who call the sinner to repentance. Moreover, one hears\nlearned arguments advanced every day to prove that it was an undpardonable,\nan egregious blunder to confer the elective franchise upon a race\njust emerging from bondage.", "25", 29, 29, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00598", "[* Oct 20 --1928 *]\nUp to Date\nA Brief Survey of \nCurrent Happenings\nBy MARY CHURCH TERRELL\n[* Boston, Mass  Parker House *]\n\nVERILY there is nothing new under\nthe sun.  Nothing illustrates that\nbetter than some news which has just\ncome from Great Britain.  An Englishman\nhas recently written a book\nto prove that the sun revolves around\nthe earth and the earth stands still.\nBut this Englishman is thirty years \nat least behind the Rev. John Jasper \nof Richmond, Va., who startled the\nworld one bright morning by saying,\n\"The sun do move and the earth do\nstand still.\"  The Rev. Jasper had a \nfamous sermon which he used to\npreach to prove his contention that\nthe sun revolved around the earth.\nAnd when it was known that he \nwould deliver this sermon the elite of\nRichmond often went to hear it.  And\nnow, after the gentlemen who in recent\nyears proclaimed the doctrine of\na motionless earth and a speeding\nsun has long ago been gathered to his\nfathers, along comes an Englishman\ntrying to steal his thunder.  But all \nof us will give the palm to Rev. Mr. \nJasper of Richmond for having made\nthis scientific discovery first.\n*  *  *  \nTHOSE who are interested in the\nnonwhite races (and surely all of\nus are) are wishing the Chinese well\nin their effort to unite all sections\nand factions into one strong government.\nNow that the Nationalists \nhave won the civil war and are trying \nto bring the whole country under \none flag they are being strongly,\nviciously opposed by Japan.  It certainly\nis a great pity that these two \npeoples are fighting each other, when\none of them is trying to take its\nplace among the great powers of the\nearth after having been divided into\nwarring groups for so long.  Japan\ndares Manchuria to unite with the\nNationalist government and threatens\nto give China trouble if this\nunion takes place.  But, since Great\nBritain, the United States and several \nother nations have decided to\nrecognize the Nationalist government,\nit is not probable that Japan\nwill attempt by force to prevent\nManchuria from uniting with it.\nThese strong nations have also\nagreed to allow China to take charge\nof her tariff herself.  Very soon,\ntherefore, she will have a much\ngreater revenue than she has ever\nenjoyed before.  The old treaties,\nwhich were so unjust to China, have \nbeen terminated, so that within a few\nmonths she will have money enough \nto increase her army and make any\npreparations to defy Japan which \nshe considers necessady.\nSurely Japan will not be so stupid\nas to start anything rough with\nChina, now that the Nationalist government\nhas the support and sympathy\nof practically all the great\npowers of the world. Japan has heard\nspokesmen for both the United\nStates and Great Britain declare that\nthey consider Manchuria an integral\npart of the Chinese republic.  She \n\ncertainly will not fly in the face of \nprovidence, therefore, by opposing\nthe union of those two tracts of\nChinese territory.  Of course Japan \ndeclares that she is simply insisting\nthat a certain old pact be respected.\nBut the Nationalist government\ncomes back hotly with the statement\nthat this pact, which gave both Japan \nand the United States rights to\nwhich they were not entitled, was\nmade by the Peking regime, which it\nhas just overthrown and that consequently \nit does not consider itself\nbound to observe it.  There is reason \nto hope that Japan will retreat\nfrom her position to keep Manchuria \nfrom becoming a part of the new\nChinese republic.  It is said that she \nhas agreed not of offer any further\nobjection to the proposed union if \nManchuria will promise not to hoist \nthe Nationalist flag for three months.\nAfter that time has expired she will \nnot interfere.  If Japan believes that\nsuch an arrangement will enable her\nto withdraw from the controversy\nwith dignity, let us hope Manchuria\nwill agree.  Let the nonwhite races\ncome together somehow. \n*  *  * \nTHANKS to a doctor in Brussels, \nBelgium, it is no longer necessary \nfor a woman to have wide or broad\nfeet.  Observing how unhappy some\nof the sisterhood were, because their\npedal extremities spread over too \nwide a surface, he set about to remedy\nsuch an unfortunate situation.\nThe method employed is as simple\nas can be.  The resourceful doctor\njust amputates one pair of little toes,\nor maybe two pairs, as necessity requires,\nand presto, change, the lady \nhas a pair of feet so narrow that she\ncan easily squeeze them into a \ntriple A.  This custom is said to be\nspreading over Europe rapidly and\nan American woman who resorted to\nthis surgical operation to reduce the\nbreadth of her ample feet, declared\nthat she received two marriage proposals\nin a week.  With such advertisement\nto comment it the practice\nof cutting off the little toes to improve\nthe appearance of milady's\nfeet will grow by leaps and bounds. \n*  *  *  \nAt last it has been discovered that\nputting students on their honor\nduring examinations is a failure.\nThose who hate to say disagreeable\nthings claim that eve though students\ndo not cheat, nevertheless they\nhave a right to expect the professor\nto be present during an examination.\nThe student may want to ask a legitimate\nquestion or he may want to\nconsult the professor about something\nwhich he has a right to discuss, \nsay those instructors who have decided\nto give up the honor system \naltogether.  There is no use subjecting\neither the young or the old to\ntemptation unnecessarily.

All of a sudden the\nIndian has assumed great importance\nand is a gentleman to be reckoned\nwith.  Both political parties are overturning\nheaven and earth to get the\nred man's vote.  A few years ago he\ndidn't have a vote, that is to say,\nmany of them did not, and nobody \nseemed to care a fig whether they\nhad one or net.  But ever since the\nIndianship Citizenship act was signed \nby President Coolidge on June 2, 1924,\nthe copper-colored beneficiaries thereof\nhave been cultivated by the politicians\nmore and more assiduously.\nAnd now, if you please, we are being\ntold that in some of the states the\nIndian actually holds the balance of\npower.  Oklahoma has the greatest \nIndian population with more than\n120,000 red men to its credit--nearly\nthree times as many as can be found\nin any other state.  And here the\nDemocrats are going to roll up their\nsleeves to save the state for friend\nAl.  Oklahoma had always been\ncounted as safely Democratic till \nPresident Harding captured it in 1920,\nbut now since a man who tells the\nworld that he is an Indian and isn't\nashamed to say so is a candidate for\nthe vice presidency on the Republican\nticket, the Democrats are not so sure\nof it as they would like to be. \nIt used to be rather difficult for the\nIndians who wanted to exercise their\nright of citizenship to do so because\nthere were comparatively few facilities.\nBut all this will be changed \nat the approaching election.  There\nwill be polling places and ballots and\nall the other paraphernalia thereunto\npertaining so that the Indians may\ncast heap many votes for their kinsman,\nCurtis, or Al Smith.\nSome years ago wise men declared\nthat the \"Indian was a vanishing\nrace,\" and he would trouble his white\nfriends who had robbed him of his\nlands but a short while longer.  But\nthere are nearly 17,000 more Indians\ntoday than there were 20 years ago,\nso it does not seem that the red an\nis dying a natural death as rapidly\nas was expected.  At any rate, he is \n\nconsidered a very important factor\nin the coming election and both\nparties are eagerly seeking his vote.\nLet us hope he will get more recognition\nif he does his duty at the polls\nthan some other groups we might\nmention.\nAlthough there are only 350,000\nIndians in the United States they \nhave been well represented in congress \nin recent years.  There have\nbeen two senators with Indian blood\nin their veins--Senator Curtis, part \nKaw, and Senator Owen of Oklahoma,\npart Cherokee--with Representative\nHastings of Oklahoma, part\nCherokee, in the house, and Houston\nB. Techee (Cherokee), register of the\ntreasury under Woodrow Wilson.\nThese Indians are the only men who\ngive any color to the congress of the\nUnited States.  Another group of\ncitizens numbering at least 12,000,000\nhave had no representative in congress \nfor 27 years.  Why?\n*  *  *  \nAN interesting health survey has\njust been made in Hagerstown, \na community consisting of 8,000 \nwhite people in western Maryland.\nThe result of this investigation is\nconsidered especially valuable because \nit is based upon facts obtained \nfrom a population exclusively white.\nThe report discloses that there is less\nsickness among persons in the early\n20s than at any other age.  The death \ntoll during infancy and early childhood\nis decidedly higher than at the\nperiod of late childhood and adolescence,\nbecause babies are more\nsusceptible to disease than they are\na few years later.  Old people die\nfrom organic diseases, the investigation\nshows, while children fall victims\nto respiratory ills.  Since the\nvarious diseases have been listed and\na record has been given which shows \nhow susceptible to them each age is,\nthis is said to be one of the most important\nhealth charts which has ever\nbeen made.

A well-to-do\nwhite woman from a distinguished \nfamily has just bequeathed her some\nvaluable property in that city where\nour friend \"Jim Crow\" rules the roost\nas a general rule.  Charlotte's mother\nhas been a domestic in Miss Margaret\nAnderson's family for a long time.\nShe evidently has given great satisfaction.\nShe probably brought her\nlittle daughter to the house where\nshe was working, or they may have\nlived there.  The story does not enlighten\nus on that point.  But we do\nknow that Miss Anderson was so\nfond of her domestic's daughter that\nbefore she passed away a few days\nago, she left her the bulk of her\nproperty.  The will was duly recorded \nin the office of the register of \nwills, so it will not be easy to break.\nNow Miss Charlotte Johnson, the\ndaughter of a domestic, owns a house\noutright at 288 King George St., and\nhas a one-third interest in a dwelling\nat 242 King George St.  She has also\na life interest in a two-story brick\nstore on Main St., which is now occupied\nby a druggist.  Miss Anderson\ndid not forget Charlotte's mother,\nwho had cooked and sewed for her\nso many years.  She left her a one-third\ninterest in a house at 244 King\nGeorge St.  When Hester, the mother,\ndies this property will revert to her\ndaughter, Charlotte.  All of the dwelling\nhouses mentioned are in prominent\nresidential sections a short block\nfrom the Naval academy reservation.\nAll the officers dressed up in their\nfine uniforms and their families live\nnear Charlotte Johnson's house and\nwill pass right by it.  That will really\nbe the fly in the ointment, so to speak. \nNobody but white boys can attend\nthe institution in which young men\nare trained for the navy.  The parents\nof boys who are not white pay taxes\nwhich support this institution, but\ntheir boys are excluded from it just\nthe same.  Well, the officers and their\nwives cannot bar Charlotte Johnson\nfrom the home which she now owns\nright in their midst.  Even if the\nhouse is destroyed, she will still own\nthe land upon which it was built.\nMiss Anderson was brought up in this\natmosphere reeking with race prejudice,\nbut she was not affected by it.\nShe believed she owed a bit of gratitude\nto the woman who had served\nher so faithfully and she probably\nbecame greatly attached to the\ndaughter.  Charlotte evidently did her\nduty to justify this attachment.\nMiss Anderson's two sisters who\nsurvive her were not mentioned in\nthe will.  She has a one-third interest\nin some of the holdings with them.\nIt will be interesting to see how this\nunusual will works out.  All we ask\nis that Charlotte Johnson gets what\nhas been bequeathed to her.\n*  *  * \nRECENTLY Prof. R. D. McKenzie\nof Washington university told the\nInstitute of Politics in Massachusetts\nthat the marriage quarantine which \nthe white man is trying to maintain\nis fast breaking down at different\npoints.  Especially is this true in the\nPacific islands, he says, where human\nbeings of different races and colors\nhave been intermarrying for years.\nPeople of various nationalities have\ngone to these outposts of civilization\nfor gain, have met and have thrown \nall the conventions of their home\nlands to the winds.  Without bothering\nabout the color or the race of the\nindividual who pleased them, they\nhave married to suit themselves, so \n\nthat there are crossings of the human\nspecies galore.  The question as to\nwhether it is wise or unwise to permit\npeoples of different physical type\nto intermarry does not disturb even\na little bit the folks who dare thus\nto fly in the face of tradition and\ncustom.  The professor says the human\nanimal today is a mongrel anyhow,\nfor he is the product of a wide \nvariety of racial types.  It has always \nbeen impossible to control the impulses\nof human beings by conventions\nand laws.  Miscegenation has\nbeen taking place for centuries and\nit is still going on today.  So far as\nthe United States is concerned, there\nare comparatively few here who can\ntruthfully claim to be of unmixed\nblood.  For this is a racial melting\npot indeed!\n*  *  *  \nIF a husband stays out night after\nnight at a club till the wee small\nhours and loses money playing poker,\nis the club liable for damages to the\nwife who is deprived of his companionship \nand a part of his income?\nThis is what the United States supreme\ncourt has been asked to decide.\nMrs. Gladys Anderson of McGill, Nev., \nhas sued the McGill club, where her\nhusband spent much of his time and\na large part of his salary, which\ncaused her \"worry, humiliation, sickness \nand grievous mental pain,\" she\nsays.  She insists that the club is a \npublic nuisance and has instituted a\nsuit against it for that reason.  The\nstate courts have dismissed the suit,\nholding that there is no provision in\nlaw warranting action against a club\non such grounds.  Now the agrieved\nwife has asked the supreme court to\nreverse this decision.\nThere are scores of women who are\nwaiting with bated breath upon the\noutcome of this unusual suit.

To be sure there is no\nbirth certificate to prove this is true,\nbecause when the hero of this story\nmade his appearance on this mundane\nsphere, birth certificates were\nnot in style.  But Mr. Li Chingyun \nhas seen sights and related experiences\nwhich leave no doubt whatever\nin the minds of some who have heard\nhim that he is as old as he claims\nto be.  On his 150th birthday he celebrated\nthe occasion by gathering\nabout him the 188 members of the\nfamily.  When he was asked to tell\nothers how they can live as long as\nhe has, he replied:  \"Keep a quiet\nheart.  Sit like a tortoise.  Walk \nsprightly like pigeon.  Sleep like a \ndog.\"  Perhaps there are some who\nwould not care to live as long as this\nChinaman has.  There are many conditions\nin life in which death is a\nreal benefactor.  It gives rest to the\nweary, surcease from sorrow to the\ngrief-stricken and relief from bodily\nills to these racked with pain.  There\nare many things worse than death.\nHowever, the old Chinaman seems\nperfectly satisfied with his lot and is\nevidently glad that he is alive.  Still\nlonger life to him! \n\n\nNovember 24-1928\nUp to Date\nA Brief Survey of\nCurrent Happenings\nBy MARY CHURCH TERRELL\n\nFOR a long time the churches of\ndifferent denominations have been\ndiscussing the desirability and the\nfeasibility of uniting.  Last May the\nMethodist general conference which\nmet in Kansas City voted to refer to\na committee the proposal for uniting\nwith the Presbyterian church.  The\nPresbyterian general assembly which\nmet at Tulsa a short time ago followed\nthe example of the Methodists\nby voting to refer the union of the\ntwo denominations to a committee\nalso.  But the Presbyterian general\nassembly declined to consider the proposal\nfor a conference in the immediate\nfuture with representatives of \nthe Congregationalist, Universalist\nand Christian churches.  This decision \non the part of the Presbyterian is\nsaid not to mean that they are opposed\nto union with these denominations.\nAll three of these denominations, \nit is explained, follow the congregational\nor independent policy in\ngoverning their churches.  The Presbyterian \nchurch does not do this.\nFor that reason, those interested in\nthe subject declare that it is wiser \nto wait till the denominations which\nhave a common policy unite, before\nan effort is made to join together in\none great union those which are dissimilar\nin church government.\nNinety per cent of the ministers \nof the Congregationalist, Universalist \nand Christian churches are in\nfavor of uniting with the Presbyterians, \naccording to a vote among\nthem which has just been taken.\nThis is very encouraging indeed.\nNothing is more discouraging and\nmore ridiculous than the attitude of\nChristian churches which object to\nunion.\n*  *  *\nTHE only real heroes in the Vestris\ntragedy were black men.  Every\nchild in the United States who has\na drop of African blood in his veins \nshould be told the story of the heroism\nwhich black men displayed when\nthat English ship went down.  it is\na story which should never be allowed\nto grow old.  Certainly two\nnames stand out in bold relief--Lionel\nLicorice, who was a quartermaster\nand who was described as \"a little\nBarbados Negro,\" and Gerald Burton,\na giant.  Not a white man aboard\nthat ill-fated ship rendered the service\nto human beings in peril and distress \nwhich those two black men did.\nNo matter what may come out later\nin the investigation, the world knows\nthe magnificent courage and marvelous\npower of endurance and resourcefulness \nunder mountainous difficulties\nwhich Licorice and Burton \ndisplayed.  For there were some white\npeople who o wed their lives to these\nmen who gave them credit for it and\ndescribed existing conditions as soon\nas they got the chance. \nA young man from South America,\nwhere, by the way, there is no prejudice\nagainst people with dark skins\nexcept that which is injected by citizens\nfrom this country, hailed Lionel\nLicorice as the outstanding hero of\nthe disaster.  This young South\nAmerican was saved after he had\nbeen swimming and floating 14 hours.\n\"That little Negro did what the officers\nof the Vestris failed to do,\" said\nRamos.  \"He took charge of boat No.\n14 and not only saved the passengers \nin it, but occasionally jumped out to \ncatch people people floating in the\nwater.  By the time the American\nShipper picked up the boat he had\nsaved 20 lives.  I cannot say that the\nofficers of the Vestris could be\npraised for their endeavor to save us.\nThe quartermaster was the only\nmember of the crew who exerted himself\nin our behalf.\"\nAnd yet, in spite of testimony like\nthat from a man just rescued from \ndeath, a Washington newspaper declared\nthat tales were being told\nabout a \"black gang seizing the boats\nand leaving struggling women to\ntheir fate.\"  Nothing shows more\nshockingly than that how deliberately\nunjust some newspaper men are to a\ngroup which they prefer to misrepresent\nand slander.\nBut Lionel Licorice was by no\nmeans the only black hero in the\nVestris disaster.  \"If it hadn't been\nfor Gerald,\" said a white woman, \"we\nwouldn't be here.\"  She was referring\nto herself and another woman who\nhad been floating for long, weary,\ndespairing hours in the sea.  The\nrescued women acclaimed Gerald\nBurton, a stoker, as a hero.  When\nthe water crept up in the boiler room\nand the Vestris was clearly doomed,\nBurton remained below and kept up \n\nsteam in an upper boiler to give\npower to the radio generator, which\nwas the last hope of the sinking ship.\nAnd Gerald Burton stuck to this\nperilous post when the vessel was\nstanding almost on her beam ends.\nWhen an overloaded boat capsized\nBurton was one of the men who\nrighted it.  He did this six times \ntill the 50 or 60 survivors had become \na mere handful.  Finally, this giant\nin strength and marvel in courage\nfound himself struggling in the water\nwith two white women.  \"Stay with \nme and I won't let you drown,\" he\nsaid.  And he kept his word manfully.\nThe two women testified that Burton \nkept shouting to them as they swam\nto be of good courage because he\nthought he had seen an answering\nwave from the ship which they hoped\nwas coming toward them to save\nthem.  Burton tore off part of his\nshirt and kept waving it wildly in\nthe air to attract the attention of\nthe people on the ship which he saw\nat a distance.  And when the Wyoming\nfinally steamed up and rescued\nthe two white women and the two\nblack men the officers said they\nwould probably not have seen the\nshipwrecked people if Burton had not\nkept waving his shirt.\nAnd while we are talking about the\nblack heroes of the Vestris, let us not\nforget those brave stokers who fed\ncoal to the huge boilers up to the last\nminute the vessel was afloat.  Those \nhalf-naked stokers with water almost\nengulfing them, deep in the\nbowels of the liner, stuck to their\nposts till one fire was washed out\nand the ship rolled over on its side.\nThey told their superior officers that\nthere was so much water in the forward\ncoal bunkers they couldn't draw \non them, but the black stokers were\nsent back.  \"We're being flooded, sir,\" \nthey reported to the chief engineer a\nlittle later.  \"Go back to your posts,\"\nhe commanded, and back they went.\n\"We can't work any more,\" they said.\nAgain they were sent back into water\nalmost up to their necks.  And again\nthey obeyed.  No sooner had the\nblack firemen gone below than the\nship rolled over and they barely had\ntime to scramble up to the deck before\nit sank.  Hats off to the brave\nblack men of the Vestris.  Let's talk\nabout them and keep the memory of\nsuch courage, endurance and heroism\ngreen forever.\n*  *  *  \nIF science keeps on making impossible\ndiscoveries there's no telling\nwhat may happen.  She is mixing \nnature's children up terribly.  A \nscientist from Europe has proved\nbeyond a doubt that monkeys, rats\nand other animals may be bred to a \ndefinite color, then changed by breeding \nto another color.  Not only can\nhe change the color of these animals,\nbut he can alter their habits and their\ncharacteristics as well.  Of course,\nit was demonstrated long ago that\nplants could be varied to an almost\nunlimited degree.  But very few\nscientists themselves believed that\nthe same thing could be done with\nanimals.  It has already happened,\nhowever.  There is a breeding institute\nin Germany where you may see\nmore than a thousand combinations\namong rats, monkeys and other animals\nwhich give them all varieties of\ncolor and alter the texture of their\ncoats.  For a long time it was considered\ndoubtful whether these types \nproduced by crossing different animals\nwould be permanent.  But this\nGerman wizard seems to have no difficulty\nin making his new creatures \nreproduce themselves.  He has proved\nthat their changed color and their\ncharacteristics are really permanent.\nThere is no telling what kind of animals\nwe may see in the future.  The\nfeatures and characteristics and customs\nof all living things may be\nchanged, human beings included. Nobody \ncan predict how far this science\nof breeding may take us.\n*  *  *  \nTHE poultry business will doubtless\nbe entirely revolutionized by a\ndiscovery which a World war veteran \nhas just made.  By means of an \nX-ray treatment he has been able to\nmake the sex of a chick in the egg\njust what he wants it to be.  He can\nhave an \"all hen hatch\" whenever he\nwants one.  This will be good news \nfor some of us who always happen\nto come home with a rooster from \nthe meat market, when we have been\nassured by the presiding genius of\nthe establishment that it is a nice,\ntender pullet.  Several scientists have\ndeclared they believe that the veteran\nhas accomplished a startling innovation\nwith far-reaching possibilities.\nIt will certainly help the poultry men. \n\n", "72", 29, 29, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00604", "Dec. 1 - 1928\nUp to Date\nA Brief Survey of Current Happenings\nBy MARY CHURCH TERRELL\n\nWhat is going to become of us when mechanical men will be employed to do many of the jobs which the genuine article is employed to do today?  That is a serious questions now.  Once a distinguished man who had promised to open an exhibition in Great Britain sent word at the last minute he couldn't come.  Provoked at this man's failure to appear, an English scientist built a mechanical man, \"Robot,\" to take his place.  This mechanical gentleman was originally created by American electrical engineers, by the way.  Now this \"Robot\" is about to show what he is really going to do.  In the lingo of the street he is now strutting his stuff in New York.  \"Robot\" is monarch of all he surveys in a big electrical distributing station which will soon supply power enough to light 300,000 homes.  In the structure over which this mechanical gentleman presides there is an impressive array of machines, switches, bus bars and dials.  Nobody will be there in that building but \"Robot.\" He will start and stop the machines himself with no human being in sight.  Three miles away, however, a man who has not been made by electricity will control his machine-made brother.\n\nIf this were only an interesting stunt it would not be so important after all.  But this is more than an experiment in electricity.  It is a threat which electricity is making to real, honest-to-goodness men.  A station as large as the one of which \"Robot\" has been placed in sole charge ordinarily requires the services of 12 to 18 men.  One operator three miles away at the center of an electrical control system can open or close any switch or do anything else that is necessary with the assistance of Mr. \"Robot\" alone.  There is one thing certain.  If real flesh and blood men are unable to find jobs, those made by electricity will find plenty to do.\n\nIn his acceptance speech at Topeka, Senator Curtis called attention to the fact that there are in the United States today between 26,000,000 and 27,000,000 women over the age of 21 entitled to vote.  He declared that \"as the years pass, these women are becoming increasingly alive to their opportunity to take a large and important part in the management and control of the country's affairs to enforce recognition, change and improvement in their own particular problems and those which interest them, and to become a distinct power in deciding all questions of vital concern to every citizen regardless of sex.\"  The vice presidential nominee also stated emphatically that \"from the first Republican party had welcomed and encouraged this development and has given women substantial recognition in its councils.  It believes in and practices the principle of full equality between man and woman.\"  And then Senator Curtis mentioned the important positions of honor, power and trust in the various departments of government to which women have been appointed.\n\nIt is truly a fine record and the Republican party has a right to feel that it has acted quite handsomely toward white women.  But what about the recognition accorded to another group of women who are not white?  What has been done for them?  Echo can only answer, \"What?\"  Not only have no rich, juicy political plums fallen into their basket, but in some parts of this country these women are not allowed to vote.  Under the headlines, \"Our Women Are Not Allowed to Register,\" one of our newspapers reported conditions in Virginia during the Harding-Coolidge campaign as follows:  \"It is not at all creditable to the solid South, dominated by our white fellow citizens that they have deemed it wise and for the best to throw all of the obstacles they can in the way of Afro-American women qualifying to vote, when they apply to do so, the same as women of other race groups.  It is a reflected upon the spirit of fairness and justice which our white fellow citizens expect of others in all matters where the rights and interests are concerned.\"\n\nThe treatment to which these women were subjected when they tried to exercise their right of citizenship was outrageous.  The registration officers asked them all sorts of ridiculous questions when they sought to qualify as voters and did everything in their power to prevent and discourage them from voting.  Perhaps conditions have improved somewhat since women were first granted the suffrage in 1920.  But it is still a well known fact that thousands of our women who would gladly cast their ballots in the approaching presidential election will be unable to do so unless prodigious effort is made to assist them.\n\nWomen who belong to the disfranchised group in a large section of this country would welcome the opportunity of changing and improving their condition if they could get it.  Do the presidential and vice presidential nominees of the Republican party really know the conditions under which many women who have always been loyal to it and to this government are living?  If they do not, somebody should tell them.\n\nThere is nothing like a sense of humor to keep people from making themselves ridiculous.  If the \"dry Democrats\" who met in Memphis a short while ago had possessed this, they could not possibly have issued a statement they made.  When somebody present it to the assembled group. they would all have laughed uproariously instead of adopting it as their slogan, and let it go at that.  But these gentlemen actually sent this delicious bit of pious pretense out to the world:  \"For the sake of the Democratic principles which Governor Smith has abandoned and transgressed, we appeal to the the millions of Democrats of the Union who revere the Constitution and respect the law to co-operate with us in wrestling democracy from the unclean hands of Tammany hall by defeating the candidacy for president of prohibition's most dangerous foe.\"  Undoubtedly some of the men who voted for that statement did so with their tongues in their cheek.  They winked at each other with an understanding nod, I am sure.  They could not possibly have suppressed a smile when they put themselves on record as revering the Constitution and respecting the law.  Some of them must have laughed out loud when they heard men in that group pledge themselves \"to repudiate the brazen attempt to commit the party (Democratic) to a policy of nullifying the Constitution.\"  To quote George Rothwell Brown, the brilliant, broadminded paragrapher for the Washington Post, \"The only lessons in nullification that this country has ever learned have been taught by the wet-drinking, dry-voting South that is forcing prohibition on the North through votes in congress based on a disfranchised population.  Watch your step, Dixie, what you really want to be afraid of is a lesson in Constitutional enforcement.\"\n\nIf we started out to find evidences of progress which we intended to record, we should discover so many of them it would be necessary to write a book instead of a short article.  Knowing this to be a fact I shall confine myself to a single instance.  Even though our national association met in Washington several weeks ago I want to call attention to a statement made casually by the chairman of the credential committee.  In giving her report to the number of delegates to the convention (and there were 636) the chairman stated that a few years ago it was sometimes difficult to read the credentials presented by the delegates because they were so poorly written and so badly spelled, but that not a single one handed in at the recent convention was either too illegible easily to read or misspelled.  That denotes progress made in a comparatively short time.  Innumerable evidences of the strides ahead made by our women might be given, but this one statement of the chairman of the credential committee furnishes one as striking and as tangible as once can cite.  \n\n\nDec. 8 - 1928\nUp to Date\nA Brief Survey of Current Happenings\nBy MARY CHURCH TERRELL\n\nWhat in the world is the matter with the police in some of our large cities?  In Philadelphia they are putting the \"guardians of the law\" into cells so fast it makes one's head swim.  These men who are supposed to protect the public from lawlessness of all kinds have been guilty of many violations of the law themselves.  They have been protecting bootleggers and getting big money for it.  One of the captains of police, it was said, would have made $4,000 in a short time.  He probably salted down much more than that.  One of the bootleggers had a get-rich-quick scheme which would have put him into Rockefeller's class very soon and would have made old Midas green with envy.  This gentleman had a neat little method of doctoring alcohol so that it looked like the real thing.  He made at least $30,000 a year selling these supposedly \"rare liquors\" to prominent residents of New York and Philadelphia.  The one reason one hesitates to believe that part of the story is because it is hard to see why any prominent resident in New York should come way over to Philadelphia to get his stuff, when there is enough and to spare at home.  Some of the political leaders were getting rich by collecting big money from bootleggers for protection - on one occasion alone this statesman got a bagatelle of $12,000.\n\nBut Philadelphia is not standing alone in this exposition of graft among her policemen and politicians.  Pittsburgh has discovered that she has some house cleaning to do herself.  There is evidence aplenty that bootleggers and gamblers have been paying the police big money to be \"protected.\"  One of the police magistrates who was dismissed has stated that every official of the administration from the mayor down knew all about the widespread corruption in the police bureau and that graft had been paid to police for vice, gambling and liquor privileges.\n\nRight here in the nation's capital the police department has had a great shake-up and men have been dismissed from the force for violating the law.  There is every reason in the world why the bootleggers and the police who protect them should clamor loudly for the 18th amendment.  Those two classes of citizens have no reason in the world to want the Volstead law either changed or repealed.  It suits them to a \"T.\"  Meanwhile, however, we are growing lawbreakers on every bush and tree.  We are being ridiculed and condemned for our hypocrisy everywhere.  The United States of America is today the most lawless nation in the civilized world.\n\nThere may be no more children entering school in 1930 than there were in 1920.  A nation-wide survey of the school situation has just been made and the bureau of education of the department of the interior has published some interesting facts.  There is a \"steadily and rapidly decreasing birth rate in the United States,\" the survey shows.  If these same conditions continue for a number of years, school enrollments will become stationary, especially in the lower grades, the bureau says.  Any material decrease in the birth rate must in time have its influence upon the number of children who are old enough to enter school for the first time each year.  In is quite evident that the number of 6-year-old children is not increasing very rapidly from year to year.  This is partially accounted for by the fact that fewer immigrants are allowed to come into the country than formerly.  The bureau states also that more Colored children are attending institutions supported by the public than they did a few years ago.  [?] 13 percent attended such schools while 36 percent now to go to public schools.  The number of children who are attending public schools as compared with those who go to private schools is rapidly increasing from year to year.\n\nIn a variety of ways white men who write for the press often misrepresent the group which is not white.  A newspaper man who syndicates short editorials which appear in a large number of dailies declared not long ago, \"The Negro in the South is as true to his own standards as other men are, but he will take a wife without benefit of clergy and feel that he does no wrong.  It is the white man's law that requires marriage, not his.\"\n\nIn the face of the well known immortality in the United States without regard to race, color or previous condition, it is indeed strange that any man who has the slightest regard for truth should single out any division or group as being especially prone to disregard laws making for decency and morality.  In the large cities of this country, not to mention Europe, it is growing more and more common for men and women to live together as man and wife \"without benefit of clergy.\"  This has been especially noticeable since the World war.  It is hardly possible that \"the Negro in the South\" sins more in this respect than do other groups who are white.  Not long ago a man who has been studying the problems of marriage and divorce in this country for a long time declared that if something drastic is not done to change the present tendency, the old-fashioned marriage will be practically obsolete in 50 years.\n\nEven though this man is recognized as an expert, nobody can believe that his prophecy can possibly come true in so short a time a 50 years.  But his statement is quoted to show how rapidly white people are transgressing the law which the moral and the self-respecting are supposed to obey.  This expert certainly was not talking about \"the Negro in the South\" when he addressed an organization of white women to whom he made the startling statement.  This habit of injecting something uncomplimentary, untrue and slanderous about those who have been the victims of such propaganda for years is altogether too common among the white writers of today.  They are always easing something into their releases which causes those who read them to lessen or lose their respect for the group  whose shortcomings and defects are so often grossly exaggerated.  But what can we do to remedy this situation?  Even if a correction of such statements were sent to the newspapers in which they have appeared, only in a very few cases would they be published.\n\nIf you had happened to be in your national capital election day you would have witnessed a sight which you could have beheld nowhere else in the United States.  In a striking and picturesque manner you would have seen the citizens observing what was called \"Humiliation day.\"  They were protesting against being disfranchised.  While citizens in every state of the Union were voting for a president of the United States, those who live in the capital of the country where not allowed to cast a ballot.  Airplanes \"bombarded\" the capital city with balloons which called attention to Washington's \"Day of Humiliation.\"  There was a great float appropriately decorated which staged a street demonstration in front of the White House and the District building.  Scores of Washington's leading business men and representatives of many civic organizations joined in the parade.  The float was nearly 20 feet high and was a mass of autumn foliage topped with evergreens.  Seated in the center was a young woman and by her side a man who represented the \"Voteless District of Columbia\" with a closed ballot box between them.  The North, South, East and West were each represented by men and woman appropriately dressed.  Locked ballot boxes were stationed at several of the principal corners of the city and in front of the White House.  Signs and banners depicting the deplorable plight of the citizens were carried in the parade.  One of them which was borne by an officer of the American Legion read \"We were good enough to fight and we are good enough to vote.\"  Another read \"Taxed without representation, citizens of Washington pay more national taxes than do those of 15 states.\"\n\nIt is very gratifying to observe that many newspapers in all sections of the country are expressing sympathy with the voteless District of Columbia and are coming out strongly in favor of an amendment to the Constitution which will enfranchise them.  The voting strength of Washington is twice as great as it is either in Delware \"Delaware\" or Wyoming and six times as great as it is in Nevada.  Let everybody help the disfranchised citizens of the national capital secure the suffrage.  It is as unjust to tax them without giving them representation in the affairs of government as it would be to deprive citizens in other states of this right guaranteed them by the Constitution.

Mentally, morally and financialy they are advancing\nat a rapid rate. From the most renowned universities as well as from\nthe best colleges and high schools throughout the United States, Colored\ngirls have graduated with honor and have thus forever settled the question\nof their capacity and worth. A few years ago a large number of young\nmen and women of the dominant race and only one Colored girl competed for a\nscholarship entitling the successful competitor to an entire course through\nthe Chicago University. As a result of the examination which was held, the\nonly Colored girl among them stood first and thus captured this great prize.\nWherever Colored girls have studied, their instructors hear testimony to\ntheir intelligence, their diligence and their skill. Of the Colored teachers\nengaged in instructing our youth about 80% are women.\nEver since a book was published in 1773, entitled Poems on Various\nSubjects by Pyllis Wheatley, Negro Servant[s] of Mr. John Wheatley of [BO]\nBoston, Colored women have from time to time, given abundant evidence of [l]\nliterary ability. In sculpture we are represented by a woman upon whose\nchisel Italy has set her seal of approval; in painting by one of Bougerau!\npupils, whose work was exhibited a few years ago in a Paris salon, and in\nmusic by [h]young women holding diplomas from the best conservatories in the\nland. In the professions we have several lawyers, together with a goodly\nnumber of dentists and doctors, whose practice is lucrative and large.\nIn business Colored women have achieved signal success. A few years\nago the largest ice plant in Halifax, Nova Scotia, was owned by a Colored\nwoman, who sold it recently for a large amount. In the state of Alabama\nthere is a large milling and cotton business belonging to and controlled\nby a Colored woman, who has sometimes as many as forty people in her employ.\nAlthough conditions prevailing in that part of my country in\nwhich the Afro-American was formerly held as a slave are not always conducive\nto the moral elevation of Colored women, although sgeguards usually\nthrown around maidenly youth and innocence are frequently withheld from\nColored girls who are protected in this section neither by public sentiment\nnor by law, according to statistics compiled by men who would\ncertainly not falsify in favor of my race, immorality among the Colored\nwomen of the United States is not so great as among women with similar environment\nand temptations in certain foreign lands.\nIndefatigably in public work of all kinds Colored women engage.\nin order to improve their own condition as well as elevate their race.\nBy banding themselves together in the interest of education and morality\n\n\n\n3\nand by adopting the most practical means to this end, during the past thirty\nyears Colored women have exerted a powerful influence for good.\nThrough various organizations, both in the Church and out, and through the\ninstrumentality of the National Association of Colored Women which has at\nleast 10,000 members at the present time and of which it is my privilege\nto be Honorary President, kindergartens have been established and successfully\nmaintained; day nurseries for the infants of working women have been\nopened; object lessons in the best way to sweep, dust, cook, wash and iron\nhave been given; classes in German, English Literature and other branches\nhave been formed; efforts have been made to establish rescue homes and retreats\nfor fallen women and tempted girls; and charity of all kinds has\nbeen dispensed. In short, what our hands have found to do, that we have\ndone with all our might.\nIn their earnest endeavor to work out their own salvation, Colored\nwomen have often been generously aided and encouraged by their more\nfortunate sisters of the dominant race, many of whom are broad in their\nviews on the race problem, just and kind in their treatment of their sisters\nof a darker hue and strong in their determination to render them any\nassistance in their power. In the United States of America there is a goodly\nnumber of women who approach as near the ideal of perfect womanhood as can\nbe found anywhere in the civilized world. Without the sympathy and hearty\ncooperation of such women, the lot of Colored women would be sad and hard\nindeed. It is a great pleasure, therefore, for me to express in this public\nway on a foreign soil my own heartfelt gratitude and that of the [3,000]\n3,000,000 Colored women in whose name I speak to night, to the white women\nof the United States, who could not possibly have more capable or more\nnoble representatives than Susan B. Anthony, the veritable Abraham Lincoln\nin the emancipation of women, May Wright Sewall, Anna Howard Shaw, Hannah\nG. Solomon, Mary Wood Swift and Ida Husted Harper, who are presented with us\nto night.\nIndustrially, Colored women are heavilly handicapped in the United States.\nThere are comparitively few avocations and trades in which they are permitted to\nengage. So overcrowded are the pursuits in which it is possible\nfor them to secure employment and so poor is the pay in consequence that\nonly the barest livelihood can be eked out by the rank and file.\nGenerally speaking, Colored women are school teachers, dressmakers, nurses\nfor children and invalids, laundresses, chambermaids and cooks.

By the\ntime it arrived there it was estimated\nthat the Klan would reach the convention\ncity 50,000 strong.  Meetings\nto start the ball rolling were held in\nNew Jersey and in Long Island and\nthings were getting into ship shape\nvery fast.  But two exalted cyclopses\nhad a big fight in Freeport, N. Y.,\nand the red shirt parade never recovered\nfrom that blow.  As a rule,\nif you wait long enough murder will\nout.  No country is safe so long as\nthere is a large group of citizens in\nits midst who are willing to use such\nhigh-handed, lawless methods to accomplish\ntheir purposes as those to\nwhich the Klan resorts.  The wonder\nis that such an organization as the\nKu Klux Klan is allowed to carry on\nand send out propaganda from the\nvery capital of the nation.\n*  *  * \nPEOPLE who have made fun of\nthose who believe in \"Christian\nhealing\" will have something to think\nabout now that the Episcopal church\nhas declared emphatically that its \nbishops and deputies have reached\nthe conclusion that there is really\nsomething in it.  A report which was\nsigned by several bishops and renowned\nphysicians was presented to\nthe general convention which recently\nmet in Washington.  \"Christian healing,\" \nsays this report, \"has passed\nbeyond the stage of experiment and\nit value cannot be questioned.\"\nAmong the physicians who signed\nthis remarkable statement was none\nother than the great Charles Mayo,\none of the two brothers who established\nthe famous Mayo clinic in\nRochester, Minn., and who is said to\nhave been the first surgeon to demonstrate\nthat goiters can be successfully\nremoved. \nFor many years physicians expressed \ndoubt that human beings\ncould be cured of their various physical\nailments by faith in religion or\nby any influence which their minds\nalone could exert upon their bodies.\nMrs. Mary Baker Eddy, the founder\nof Christian Science, claimed that\nremarkable cures had been wrought\nby the faith which those who belonged\nto her church reposed in the\nmethods of healing which she recommended\nin her new religion.  Personally,\nit was always hard for me\nto believe many of the remarkable \nstories which I have heard about the\ncures which people have told me\ncould be ascribed to nothing but faith \nin an unseen power to heal.  Try as\nhard as I might, I could not grasp it.\nI was once the guest of a woman\nin Horner, N. Y., once called Hornersville,\nwho told me an astounding\nexpeience which she herself had had\na short while before she entertained\nme.  The day before she was to read\nan address to her club about her\ntravels abroad, she said, she fell and\nbroke her shoulder blade.  She did \nnot call a physician at the time and\nhad never done so, she declared.  And\nthe day after the accident she appeared\nbefore her club and filled her\nengagement as though nothing had\nhappened.  There was no doubt whatever\nshe had broken her shoulder\nblade, she said, for a physician to\nwhom the accident was described had\ntold her friends that this had assuredly\noccurred.  Although it was \nhard for me to believe my hostess,\nI dared not do otherwise, for she was\na woman of the highest integrity.\nMoreover, her friends assured me\n\nthat they knew what she stated was\na fact.\nNow that the bishops and other\ndignitaries of the Protestant Episcopal\nchurch in convention assembled\nhave [de]clared that \"such healing is\nan experience of mankind that can\nno longer be questioned,\" those of us\nwho have been \"doubting Thomases\" \nshould investigate the subject more\nthoroughly than we have ever done\nbefore.  We live to learn.  It is foolish\nto close our minds against new\ntruths of any kind.  \"Throughout the\nworld,\" says the report, which was\nsigned, mark you, by some of the\nmost distinguished churchmen and\nphysicians in the United States,\n\"spiritual healing no longer is the\nhope of a few, but the belief and\npractice of a large and rapidly increasing\nnumber of persons.\"  The\nopinion was expressed, however, that\nall faith healing should be carried on\nin close co-operation with medical\nscience and practice.  This will not\nbe concurred in by the dyed-in-the-wool\nChristian Scientists and others\nwho believe that if one has faith\nenough, neither doctor nor medicine\nwill be necessary to effect a cure.  To\nmake the report most emphatic, the\nlearned men who signed it commend\nto the church \"such efforts as are\nbeing made by trained men and\nwomen under sanction of Episcopal\nauthority to awaken men to the\ntruths of spiritual healing.\"  Mary\nBaker Eddy did not live in vain.  The\ntruths she tried to enunciate seem\nto be marching boldly and rapidly on, \neven if some of us cannot grasp them \nas well as we should like.  At any\nrate, when she was being ridiculed\nby the wise as well as the foolish\nbut a few years ago, no one would\nhave dared to predict that such a\nconservative body as the Protestant\nEpiscopal church in conjunction with\nfamous surgeons would urge ailing\nhuman beings to practice the methods\nof healing in which she so strongly\nbelieved.\n*  *  *\nAND now something else has happened\nto show what a complicated\ninstitution marriage may become\nevery now and then.  The latest\nproof of this fact is the effort made\nby the wife of a man who was nominated\npresident of the American Nation\nRetail Jewelers association to\nprevent him from receiving that\nhonor.  When she heard that the\nnominating committee had selected\nher husband for that office, she arose\nin the convention and protested vigorously\nagainst having him elected\npresident.  \"I won't have it,\" said this\nwife indignantly.  \"They can't elect \nMr. F_____ president.  He will be away\nfrom home so much that our life will\nbe nothing but a companionate marriage.\" \nBut the husband declared\nthat he had been the bread winner \nin his family for 25 years and intended \nto continue in that capacity.\nThat settled it and he was elected.\nThe wife was greatly upset, but was\nfinally persuaded to go to her hotel\nand then the delegates heaved a sigh\nof relief.  No matter what may be\nour opinion of the wisdom or the folly\nof a wife who publicly protests\nagainst having her hus[ban]d elected \nto a position on the ground that it\nwill necessitate his absence from\nhome continuously, we must give her\ncredit for having much more courage\nthan the average woman possesses.\nSuch a wife should also receive a\nrather high mark for originality.  It\nprobably has occurred to very few\nwomen that theirs is simply a \"companionate\nmarriage\" because their\nhusbands stay away from home a\ngreat deal.  They take the repeated\noften lon[g] drawn out absences of\nfriend husband as a matter of course. \n*  *  *  \nSOME of the states re realizing\nthat an effort must be made to\nprovide old age pensions.  It is becoming\nmore and more common for\ncorporations and employers to discharge\nmen and women at the age \nof 50 or less, under the pretense that\ntheir efficiency is on the wane.  Naturally,\nthis practice throws a burden\non the state.  At present in some\nstates even if a workman is totally\nand permanently disabled at his job,\nthe workmen's compensation law only\nprovides him with care and attention\nfor a few years.  If the men who are\ntrying to enact laws to promote the\nwelfare of workingmen succeed, employees\nwho are permanently and\ntotally disabled will receive compensation\nas long as they need it.  This\nprovision would certainly be a long\nstep in advance for workingmen.\n\n", "86", 29, 29, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00617", "HE\no  Defender\nGREATEST  WEEKLY\nGO, ILL., SATURDAY, JANUARY 26, 1929\n\nYS DISCR\nervations\nThe Trend of Current\nThought and Discussion\n\nRebuttal\nJ.

Simply effect\nfollowing cause.  Neglect followed by\na consequence.  Science is frank in\ndealing with questions.  It either answers\nthem, attempts to answer them\nor admits it cannot answer them.\nFor hundreds of years the scientific\nworld sought the answer to the\norigin of life.  Highest authorities\nin biological science applied themselves\nto it.  They arrived at a conclusion.\nThey could not tell what\nlife was, or is, but they told what\nonly could produce it.  Huxley said: \n\"The doctrine of Biogenesis--life only \nfrom life--is victorious.\"  And while\nTyndall confessed he wished it were\notherwise, he said:  \"I affirm nothing\nexists to prove that life has ever\nappeared independently of antecedent\nlife.\"  Now where there is life giving \nthere must be a life giver.

These facts have been recently\ngiven out by the Eastman Kodak\ncompany, which made an extensive\ntest with 5,000 children who were\ntaught by films in the public schools\nof 12 cities scattered from coast to\ncoast.  The gains of these children\nwere compared with those made by\n5,500 children who were taught by the\nold methods.  Dr. Ben D. Wood of\nColumbia university and Dr. Frank\nN. Freeman of the University of Chicago \ndirected the experiment for ten\nweeks last spring, so there can be\nno doubt either about the manner in\nwhich the tests were made or the\ncorrectness of the results which were\nobtained.\nTeachers co-operated in the experiment,\nand classes were chosen to be\nas nearly equal in ability as possible,\nso that those engaged in the test\nmight measure the aid given children\nby the movies.  Not only was it definitely\nestablished that those pupils\nlearn quicker and better, who are\ntaught partly by films, but it was the\nconsensus of opinion among all the\nteachers who took part in the experiment\nthat the movies in the classroom\nhave been most effective in\narousing and sustaining the interest \nof children, in improving the quantity\nand quality of their reading and\nin aiding them to apply the lessons\nlearned in school to their own personal\nexperiences and to the conditions\nwhich obtain in the communities\nin which they live.  It is not\nproposed to substitute films for school\nmethods used at present, or to revolutionize \nthe whole scheme of education,\nbut to use them to supplement\nthe means and devices which are now\nemployed.  In teaching geography\nfilms were shown which gave a true\npicture of the fisheries in New England, \nof the dairies in Wisconsin and \nof the methods of growing and converting\nwheat into bread.  In the\nteaching of general science films were\nused to explain compressed air, to\nshow how iron ore was converted\ninto pig iron, how water is purified\nand how to plant and care for trees.\nThere is no doubt whatever that\neverybody grasps anything much\nmore quickly when he sees what he\nis trying to learn with his eyes than \nwhen he reads the cold printed page\nabout facts which he must try to \nvisualize and then memorize.  Let us\nintroduce the movies into our public\nschools so that we may help the children\nacquire knowledge in the best\nand quickest way.\n*  *  *\n\"GOOD looks makes for good\nhealth.\"  That's what the superintendent\nof the St. Elizabeth's hospital \nfor the insane in the national\ncapital tells us.  Acting on that principle,\nDr. White has had a beauty\nparlor installed for the women patients\nwho are mentally ill.  A large\nnumber of the 1,300 women who are\nin this asylum patronize this parlor\nregularly.  \"The beauty treatment\ngives our women patients self-respect,\" \nsays the superintendent.\n\"It bucks them up, makes them take\nan interest in life.  It makes the patients \nforget they are in an institution\nand it makes them feel they are\non the same level with other people\non the outside.  We encourage our\npatients to buy nice clothes, if they\nhave the means.  If they cannot afford\nit, and we have to provide them with\nclothes, what we give them is far differenct\nfrom the drab uniforms of the \nold days.\"\nThere is no doubt whatever that\nDr. White, who is an expert on mental\ndiseases, has hit the nail on the\nhead.  One of the first signs that any\nhuman being is \"slipping\" is his indifference\nto his appearance.  It is a \nwoman's duty always to look as well\nas she can.  In her own home a \nwoman often fails to make herself\nas presentable as she should.  And\nright there she makes a big mistake.\nIt may not indicate that she is losing\nher mind but it does prove that she\nis losing some very valuable characteristics\nto which she should tenaciously \ncling.  Being obliged to do her\nhousework is no excuse for a woman\nwho is slovenly in appearance.\nHouse dresses are comparatively\ncheap and water with a little soap\nwill keep them clean.\nOne of my friends says that when\nshe begins to feel a bit depressed and\nobservers, as she passes a mirror,\nthat she is beginning to look old, she\nruns and puts on her high heel slippers,\ndons a becoming dress and\n\"fixes\" her face.  \"Then,\" says she,\n\"I feel twenty years younger, and I \n\nlook it too.\"  Dress certainly makes\na great difference not only in one's\nown personal feelings, but in the impression\nwhich one makes upon others.*  \nWhen people who are hunting \nwork and fail to get it, they should\nsee whether their personal appearance\nmilitates against them.\n\"We send women to the beauty\nparlor,\" says the superintendent of\nSt. Elizabeth's asylum, \"when we\nfind their hair is getting thin or their\ncomplexions are getting sallow.  After\na treatment at the beauty parlor they\ngenerally show a much greater interest \nin life and in themselves.\"  the\nCreator of the universe has given us\nflowers and trees, mountains and seas\nto beautify the world.  He certainly\ndid not intend that his creatures\nshould make no effort to beautify\nthemselves.\n*  *  *  \nTHERE is a new branch of the\nhooded order and its representatives\nhave very important duties to\nperform indeed.  They are the police,\nor Klavaliers, as they are called.\nThey are equipped with clubs, .45-caliber\nrevolvers and ammunition and\nwear uniforms which strikingly resemble\nthose of state troopers in New\nYork. These me appeared at meetings\naddressed by Thomas Heflin \nwhen he spoke against Governor\nSmith and the Catholic church.  When\nSenator Heflin spoke in New Jersey\nlast June, these Klan policemen\nhustled one man off the field and refused\nto tell him either who they\nwere or where they obtained their\nauthority. to force him to leave\nSeventeen of the \"Klavaliers\" were \nsent to guard Heflin when he spoke\nin Albany, but only three of them\nwere on duty in Philadelphia when\nhe addressed a meeting there on\nMemorial day.  The high official who\ngave this information to a newspaper\nreporter explained that this small\nnumber was sent to Philadelphia because\n\"Philadelphia is a Klan tow\nand nobody would hurt Heflin.\" \nThe Klan police post signs whe\nmeetings are to be held.  These are\nmade of cardboard, cut in the shape\nof arrows which points to the meeting\nplace.  It is very easy for Klansmen\nto understand these signs, because\nthe letters \"K I G Y\" appear \nupon them, which, being interpreted \nmeans, \"Klansmen, I greet you.\"\nWhile some of these Klavaliers have\npermits to possess and carry revolvers,\nmany ignore the law which in\nthe state of New York prohibits citizens \nfrom carrying revolvers without\na permit.\nWhen a man becomes a Klan policeman\nhe must take a special oath.\nAmong other things he says:  \"I,\n-----, of my own free will and accord,\nin the presence of Almighty\nGod, do hereby solemnly promise and\nswear that I will keep my mouth\nsealed to everyone and never reveal\nthe secrets of the rangers, such as\nsummons to meetings, business and\nthe identity of members, also any\nmission relayed to me by my major\nemanating from our exalted cyclops\nto any person unless instructed to\nreceive same and only upon a strict\nexamination.\"  A copy of this oath\nis in the possession of the New York\nWorld.\nHow long can a republic live and\nthrive if an organization like the Ku\nKlux Klan is allowed to grow to large\nproportions?\n*  *  *  \nWHILE Mrs. Eddy would have rejoiced \nat the rapidity with which\nher doctrines are being received by\nthe great men of the earth, nevertheless \nher heart would be saddened\nat the dissensions which have arisen\nin her church.  Only recently one of\nher closest friends tried to tie up \nsome church funds and announced \nthat she is now \"leader No. 2.\"  \"I \nclaim that I am the divinely authorized \nsuccessor to Mrs. Eddy,\" says\nthis Mrs. Gilbert of New York defiantly,\n\"and that I am leader No. w \nof the Christian Science church.\nMary Baker Eddy has been dead 18 \nyears and they claim that she is still\nthe leader of the church.

It\nwas Phyllis Wheatley, a young African\npoetess, who wrote a poem in his honor\nand in one of the lines addressed him\nas \"first in peace and honors\" several\nyears before the Declaration of Independence\nwas signed.\nIn this poetical tribute to George\nWashington the young African girl displayed\na knowledge of history and\nmythology such as few women living in\nthis country at that time possessed.  In\nexpressing her admiration for the man\nwho was fighting to wrest the Colonies\nfrom British oppression, she sings:\n\nFamed for thy valor, for thy virtues\nmore,\nHear every tongue thy guardian aid\nimplore.\nAnd she concludes her panegyric in\nthe following lines:\nProceed, great chief, with virtue on\nthey side;\nThy every action let the goddess\nguide!\nA crown, a mansion and a throne\nthat shine\nWith gold unfading, Washington, be\nthine.\n\nWith the poem went a letter to Gen.\nWashington, sent from Providence, R. I. \nand dated October 26, 1775; \"Sir,\" Phyllis\nwrote, \"I have taken the freedom to address\nyour excellency in the inclosed\npoem and entreat your acceptance,\nthough I am not insensible to its inaccuracies.\nYour being appointed by the\nGrand Continental Congress, together\nwith the fame of your virtue excite \nsensations not easy to suppress.

Then, accidentally coming\nacross the poem one day, George Washington \nmade the following comment\nupon it in a letter written to his friend\nCol. Reed:  \"In searching over a parcel\nof papers the other day in order to destroy\nsuch as were useless, I brought it\n(the poem) to light again.  At first, with\na view to doing justice to her poetical\ngenius, I had a good mind to publish\nthe poem, but not knowing whether it\nmight not be considered a mark of my \nown vanity than a compliment to her,\nI laid it aside till I came across it again\nin the manner just mentioned.\"\nThen, feel[?] it was his duty to\n[?]nowledge [?] black [?]\n\n\ncarpet, shivering with the cold.  If you\nhad asked,  \"What is your name, little\ngirl?\" she would not have understood\nyou, and, even if she had understood\nand answered your question, the little\nforeigner's name would have sounded\nvery queer to you.\nShe had been stolen from her native\nland, packed like a sardine in a slave\nship with many others of her countrymen,\nand suffered the horrors and tortures \nof what was called \"the middle\npassage,\" and had been brought by \nwhite men into this country to be\nsold as a slave.\n*  *  *  *  \nA LADY who wanted to train a young\nwoman servant to take the place\nof an old one who was growing too\nfeeble to work went to the slave market\nin Boston to see what she could find\nin that line.  The pathetic face of the\nshivering child appealed to this woman\nso strongly that she bought her, in\nspite of the fact that her little body\nappeared very frail.\nSixteen months from that time the\nyoung slave girl was reading the most\ndifficult passages in the Bible.  Six\nyears from the day she was sold she\nhad become so proficient in speaking\nand writing the English language that\nshe had written a poem to the University\nof Cambridge, 9 years from \nthe day she had been bought as a \nslave she had published a poem on the\ndeath of a distinguished clergyman and\n12 years later after entering Mrs. Wheatley's\nservice her volume of poems was published\nin London.\nPhyllis was very fortunate in having\nMrs. Wheatley as her mistress.  Let us \npause long enough to give a vote of\nthanks to that lady.  The law did not\nforce her to be merciful to the little\nslave and certainly nobody expected\nher to give the girl a chance to develop \nher mind.\nIn her new home Phyllis became the\nspecial servant of Mrs. Wheatley's\ntwins, Nathaniel and Mary, who were \n10 years older than their slave.  One day\nMary saw the little African trying to\nform letters on the wall with a piece\nof chalk.  She doubtless thought it\nwould be great fun to teach her. She\ntried, and the progress made by her\nblack pupil was the sensation of that\ntime.  What a debt of gratitude Phyllis'\nrace and the whole world owe to\nMary Wheatley!  Very soon the girl began\nto write poems \"for her own amusement,\" \nthe preface of her book states.\n\"She had no intention ever to have\npublished them,\" said her master, \"nor\nwould they now have made their appearance\nbut at the importunity of\nmany of her best friends.\"\nBoth the extent and variety of the\nslave girl's knowledge are amazing.

She only knew she came\nfrom somewhere in Africa.  She must\nhave been born either in 1753 or 1754\u2014\nnot later than 1754, it is thought.  She\nwas probably between 7 and 8 years of\nage when she was dragged more dead\nthan alive from the slave ship in Boston.\nProbably because of the long hours\nwhich the girl spent in study, reading\nand writing, when she should have been\nasleep, coupled with the household work\nwhich, as a slave, however highly favored,\nshe was obliged to perform, Phyllis' \nhealth began to fail when she was\n20 years old.

Knowing that many would\ndoubt that the African girl really wrote\nthe poems, Mr. Wheatley had some of\nthe most distinguished people in New\nEngland vouch for that fact.\nIn one of the preliminary pages of\nher book, his excellency, the Governor,\nThomas Hutchinson;  the Lieutenant\nGovernor and John Hancock, the first\nsigner of the Declaration of Independence,\ntogether with 15 others, affixed\ntheir names to the following statement: \n\"We whose names are underwritten do\nassure the world that the poems specified\nin the following pages were (as we\nverily believe) written by Phyllis, a \nyoung Negro girl who was but a few\nyears since brought, an uncultivated\nbarbarian, from Africa and has ever\nsince been, and now is, under the disadvantage\nof serving as a slave in a\nfamily in this town.  She has been examined\nby the best judges and is\nthought qualified to write them.\"\nWhen Phyllis was 25 she married a\nman of her own race and seems thereafter\nto have been very unhappy, indeed. \nThe estimates placed upon the\nability and character of this husband\nseem about as contradictory and varied\nas they could well be.  According to\nsome, he was \"a Negro who kept a\nshop, wore a wig, carried a cane and\nfelt himself superior to all kinds of labor.\"\nOthers claim that he was a grocery \nkeeper, a baker journeyman and a\nman of all jobs.\n*  *  *  *  \nAt some time in his life there is evidence\nthat he was a lawyer, and\nat another time in his career he tried\nhis hand at medicine.  John Peters is\nalso depicted as \"a man who not only \nbore a good character but was a very\nremarkable specimen of his race, being\na fluent writer, a ready speaker and an\nintelligent man.\"  Under the title of\n\"Dr. Peters,\" we are told, \"he pleaded \nthe cause of his brethren, the Africans \nbefore the tribunals of State.\"\nBut whatever doubt may exist about\nthe ability and character of Phyllis'\nhusband, it is certain that he lost all\nhis property during the Revolution, was\nimprisoned for debt and was unable to\nsupport his family.

Those Juniors seemed to have the \nidea that the ball game was theirs and that \nthey might do with it whatever they pleased; \nif they shouted, Foul! foul it was, the decision\nof the referee to the contrary, notwithstanding;\nif they desired that '92 should win, '92\nmust win, regardless of '91's opposition. \nHaving permitted such ideas to enter their \npates, they proceeded to act accordingly with\nall the power of their lungs and vocal chords,\nstooping even to personal remarks when other\nmeans failed. \n  Such actions were very disagreeable to the \nother spectators as well as to the Sophomores,\n who were taking part in the game. When a \nskillful play is made it is very well to applaud\nand to give encouragement, but to dictate to \nthe umpires and referee what decisions they\nshall render is transgressing, by far, the role\nof a spectator.  It is quite a subject for speculation \nas to whether inter-class feeling alone \ncould have induced those Juniors to applaud\nand back the Freshman in so boisterous a manner,\nor whether the motive was still deeper\nseated, affecting, perhaps, their pockets. \nWhatever the motive may have been it would\ndoubtless have been better for those concerned \nhad they been less officious and more quiet. \nIt is to be hoped that they will be so hereafter.  \n-----------------------------------------------\n  It is gratifying to notice the increased \ninterest taken this year in the work of the Literary\nSocieties. The exercises are no longer\nomitted, as they were almost every other \nSaturday last year; and in addition to this, the\nmajority of those on duty usually make it \na point to be present. \n  Of course these are exceptions. Some of \nthe students are so constitutionally lazy that\nthey will shirk any duty whatever, it it involves\na little extra work; then some are compelled\nat times to be absent; hence, there \nsometimes occurs a combination of the two \nclasses of absences, which makes a break in \nthe regular work. \n  As a rule, however, the exercises are good,\nwhich seems to show a renewed desire to\nmake beneficial this useful auxiliary to the \nregular course. \n-----------------------------------------\nThe campus has been very much improved\nin its appearance, lately, by the removal of a\nportion of the fence.  Its appearance is quite\nnovel, and instills one with a sense of liberty\nand unrestraint.  The removal of all obstacles\nhas made it very pleasant and convenient for\nthe student in his perambulations, as well as\nfor several ruminants which, in defiance of\nmunicipal law, still wander about the streets\nwithout a guardian. A further improvement, \nwhich we might suggest would be the removal\nof the remaining portion of the fence.  It \ncertainly affords no protection to the campus\nnow that a part has been removed, while it \ndoes detract from its best appearance. \n  There is, however, a tendency on the part of \nsome of the boys, to take undue advantage of\ntheir liberties. Not one of them would think\nof riding horseback about the campus were\nthey obliged to open a gate, but now it seems \nto be a great delight to them to make a tournament \npark of the campus, and to imitate ye \nknights of ye olden time.  This may be very \ngood exercise, but it is questionable whether\nthe benefit derived by those participating will \ncompensate for the injury which the campus\nsustains, especially during this wet weather. \n--------------------------------- \n The last Thursday in November is rapidly\napproaching. The college student has already\nbegun to dream of home, with its familiar \nscenes and faces, of the Thanksgiving dinner\nwith its well supplied board, of the savory\nturkey and of the pumpkin pie.  \"For this is\nThanksgiving Day.\" Every student is probably \nready and willing to give thanks for a \nday of rest from the cares and toils of student\n\n\n\nMARIETTA COLLEGE OLIO.               43\nlife. Would that they were equally ready and \nwilling to attend to their duties again when\nthe day of feasting and thanksgiving is passed. \nIt seems to take the average student full the \nremainder of the week to recover from the effects \nof this one day.  It is a question in college \npolicy whether it would not be just as \nwell to release the student from college duties\nfor the rest of the week for the sole purpose \nof recuperating.  Many of the students go\nhome and expect to visit there until the following\nweek, while those who remain at college \nwould think it quite contrary to an old\nand well established precedent to be well prepared \nfor their recitations during the few remaining \ndays of the week. \n-----------------------\n  A recent number of the Athens Current expresses\nfully the feeling which should exist \nbetween institutions of learning. It extends \nto us the right hand of fellowship, and expresses\nthe interest taken by the students of \nthe University in the affairs of this College. \nA few years ago there was  a spirit of enmity \nbetween the two, which showed itself very \nobtrusively through slighting articles in the \nperiodicals of the schools. One was always\nwatching for something in the other which \nmight be ridiculed; and if nothing could be\nfound, something was invented. Hence there\nwas continued squabbling. We are glad this \nold spirit has died out; that the new set of \nstudents considers a feud unworthy the attention \nof a progressive generation.  Such petty\nquarrels belong rather to the dark ages, than\nto the enlightenment of the nineteenth \ncentury. They must give way to the brotherly\nfeeling which should exist among all striving\nfor knowledge. \n The OLIO welcomes this expression of goodwill\nas the beginning of a new era of friendship \nbetween the two institutions, and hopes\nthere may be frequent expressions of interest\non both sides. We join hands with you, and \nreturn your greeting.  \n-----------------\nThe election is over and Mr. Harrison is \nelected.  The accompanying excitement, \nwhich was very moderate among the students \nin comparison with that of the country in \ngeneral, has almost wholly subsided.  A few \ntardy returns are still to come in, and a few \nridiculous wagers are still to be paid.  Now \nthe people can take a calm retrospect of the \n events of the last few months, and decide a \nquestion which could not be answered in the \nheat of the conflict: Whether the country \nhas gained or lost by the campaign through \nwhich it has just passed. \n  That the nation, as is declared by some political\nnewspapers; has been saved from ruin, \nis a statement wholly unworthy the consideration \nof an intelligent mind. Hence it may be \n thrown aside as not affecting the question. \nThere then comes up the fact of the education \nof the people.  The campaign has undoubtedly \nbeen a great education. How many thousands \nare now well informed on the question of \nthe tariff, who before knew nothing about it?\nHow many have become familiar with the resources \nof our country, with the internal \neconomy of our government, and with its relations \nto foreign nations? These persons have \nthus become better citizens, better business \nmen, better legislators; and as the good of the \npeople is the good of the nation, no one can \ndeny that this has been a vast gain to the \ncountry.  Besides, we have become more \nawakened to the condition of a portion of our \npopulation, which will probably secure the attempt \nat some remedy. \n  But to offset these gains, the country has\nsuffered a heavy loss.  We hardly accept the\nstatement that has been made, that business \nhas been injured to the extend of half a billion \ndollars, but that the country has suffered a \ngreat money loss cannot be denied.  Immense \nsums were wasted in campaign expenses, and \nbusiness suffered a stagnation from which it \nwill not immediately recover.  Some would\nsay that this expense is justified by the great \ninterests at stake. \n  In campaigns of late years, all of which \nhave been almost as costly as the last, there\nhave been no great issues before the country.\n  In the present, protection and free-trade\nclaimed the attention of the people; but even \nthis issue was practically lost sight of in the \nbitter animosities of party strife.  Does the \nresult justify the great cost? We say most\nemphatically, no! Education can be obtained \nmore cheaply than it is furnished under the\ncostly tutorship of a national campaign. Besides \nwhat can offset the bad moral influence \nof an arousal of sectional feeling, and of the \ncirculation of calumny and slander by those \nvery organs which should aid in improving the \nnation's morals? Again, the country generally \ngoes on quietly and prosperously through a \nfour year's administration ; and experience has \nshows that there is no reason to believe that \nthere will be any violent or radical change at \nthe beginning of the next four.

He had promised \nto do that and he always kept his word. The train had no sooner started \nthan he felt in his pocket for a letter.

In the course of the discussion, he refers to the experiments of of Robert Bakewell of Dishley, in Leicestershire, in producing choice breeds of sheep by artificial selection. He describes Mr. Bakewell's method as follows:\n   \"He first traveled over England, and part of the continent, to discover and select animals of the same species, possessing certain peculiarities of form, and other qualities which he was desirous to render permanent. By selecting two animals to breed from, which possessed the desired qualities in an eminent degree, and afterwards selecting from their offspring those in which these qualities were most conspicuous and breeding again from them, the peculiarities were further increased. By continuing the same selection through four or five generations, he obtained races that would transmit the same qualities permanently to succeeding generations.\"\n   Then the author applies this principal to explain the appearance of new forms of Mollusca in the tertiary beds, as follows:\n   \"Let us, however, imagine, what is very possible, that a number of individuals of one species of bivalve or univalve shell were driven, during a violent storm, into a distant part of the ocean, where the animals could no longer obtain their accustomed food, but were still able to support life by ailment of a somewhat different kind. Let us suppose that the annoyances to which they had before been subject, from natural enemies or other causes, were changed for annoyances of another kind. Under these different circumstances, is it probable that the animals themselves would undergo some change, and modify the construction of their shells in some degree, to render them better suited to the new conditions in which they were placed? Thus, in the course of a few generations, we should have a race which conchologists would call a distinct species.\"\n   To this the author adds this footnote in the fifth edition (1838): \"What was above stated hypothetically in the fourth edition of this work may now be asserted as ascertained facts. Dr. Harlan, a distinguished American naturalist, informed the author that testaccous Mollusca removed from one river to another in America were observed in time to change the form of their shells. Mr. Gray, in the Philadelphia Transactions, 1833, states that great varieties of form are produced in shells of the same species, by a removal from calm to agitated water.\"\n   Here the chief points of Darwin's theory of the origin of species are expressed. They are founded, also, upon observed facts. The results produced by artificial selection are taken as examples of what would take place in nature under the assumed circumstances; and this \"natural selection\" is proposed as a sufficient explanation of the appearance of \" a race which conchologists would call a distinct species.\"\n   The author states also, referring to Mr. Bakewell, \"I have heard him say, that he scarcely knew any assignable limits beyond which these changes, both", "8", 36, 36, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-023:00737", "4\nencouraged him and then again she didn't. The knowing ones explained Ruth\nBradley's treatment of Jack Conrad by saying that she was too sure of him\nOthers contended that she must be a lineal descendant of Alexander, the\ngreat, because she was always seeking new worlds to conquer. Whether Miss\nBradley loved Jack Conrad or not, it would have done her very heart good\nto introduce Tom McClellan to some of her friends with that glance of the\neye and incline of the head which would plainly indicate to them that here\nwas another scalp dangling at her belt. After mature deliberation Miss \nBradley decided to attend the party that evening.\nWhile the guests were enjoying the refreshments, Alice Stanley began to tell a\nstory. \"The funniest thing imaginable happened this morning\", said she.\n\"Right after the postman came, the girl brought me a letter. Without looking\nat the address, as I usually do, I opened it. Lo and behold, it was\nnot for me at all, but for some Miss Jerome from an individual by the\nname of Thomas McClellan. He was evidently a stranger in the city and it\nwould not take a fortune teller to discover he was very much smitten\nwith the young lady's charm[s]\". \"See how sanctimonious Ruth Bradley looks\" interrupted\none of the young ladies. \"She looks as mad as a March hare\",\nsaid another. Neither one of the young women who had observed Miss Bradley's\nexpression knew anything about her acquaintance with Tom McClellan,\nso malice did not inspire their remarks, but there were two others who did and who concealed their not to say able knowledge with difficulty. \"I'll bet dollars to doughnuts\",\nsaid one of the young men, \"that the letter delivered at your house on\n2nd street was intended for somebody living at the same number on Q street.\nLetters sent to those two streets are always getting mixed up, the letter\ncarriers say. I saw a fellow rip roaring mad the other day, because his\ntailor's bill intended for 2nd street had been delivered at his girl's\nhouse on Q street and her little brother had opened it just for fun\"\n\"But listen to my tale of woe\", exclaimed one of the young men in the\ngroup. \"I invited a young lady to go to the theatre one night and told her\nif she could go, never mind answering the note. when I went to her house\n\n5\non I street the night I was to take her to the play, I found her ready to \ngo somewhere else with another fellow! I learned afterward that the letter\nsent to her house on I street had been delivered at the same number on\n1st street. \"Tell me, Miss Stanley\", said one of the group, \"why on earth\ndid the postman leave a letter addressed to Miss Jerome at your house,\nwhen nobody by that name lives there?\" \"Very easily explained\", was the\nreply. \"Jane knew we were expecting company. So when the postman asked\nher if Miss Jerome was staying at our house, she took it for granted that\nwas the name of the young lady who was coming to pay a visit, told the\npostman so, and he gave her the letter. [It never occured to me, though, that it was intended for somebody on Q street, or I should have forwarded it.\"] [When the handwriting] Without looking at the address, [taking it] I opened the letter, taking\nit for granted, of course, it was intended. [Then after] I had read the first line or two before realizing it was not [intended for me] mine\n\"Alice\", said Ruth Bradley, a short while after the story had been related, after that any curiosity was so [piqued]aroused [that] I just could not stop. -[*over*]\nI want to show you a beautiful handkerchief I have just received.\nIf you will be at home tomorrow morning, I'll bring it over\", \"By all\nmeans\", was the reply. Dont fail to come. I'll look for you.\" \"Whatever you do save the [*3*]\nletter [*4*] Alice [*2*], said she, I'm dying to see it\".\nThe next morning at ten oclock Ruth Bradley was standing at Alice Stanley's \ndoor. After a general conversation the letter was produced and both young\nladies laughed heartily over its contents. During her merriment, however,\nMiss bradley was careful to take Tom McClellan's address. She could have\nstood the dissapointment incident to his failure to call, but her humiliation\nand indignation rose high every time she recalled the expression\nworn by the young ladies to whom she had boasted of McClellan's infatuation\nfor her. She determined to write that young man a letter which he\nwould not soon forget and then let him go. Jack Conrad knew nothing about\nit, that was one consolation, anyway. He should never know it either.\nIf he ever heard it, she would deny it in to to. \n\"Well I'll eat my hat. This is a scorcher right.\", said T.L.

The Pastors, therefore, get the funds\nand entrain for the convention where this money is delivered to\nthe Finance Committee. Once it is there, the Machine starts\nto work.\n\nNow Machines are held together by two things, money and\npatronage. The money having been brought for a specific purpose,\nthe question is, How is it maneuvered to benefit the\nMachine? First, by the abuse of the expense accounts. A committee\nappointed by the President audits your expenses, and this\ncommittee knows whether or not you are with the Administration\nand very frequently will audit according to your loyalty and not\naccording to the justness of your bill. One makes a grave mistake\nif he thinks that a Baptist position is an empty honor.\n\nNot only has The Machine a good sum of money as a material\nbasis of operation, but it has patronage at its disposal. What\nPatronage has a Baptist convention? I need not consume space\nby naming all the board members, editors, secretaries, ushers,\nspecial writers, missionaries, and field agents. They are there\nand by the hundreds. But the Machine has another kind of \npatronage more potent than office dispensing. A recommendation\nfrom a national or State official goes a long way in securing\na desirable pastorate. The Machine takes good pains to see that\nonly deserving children go before a congregation with the proper\nmagic.\n\nLast but not least, The Machine has an educational foundation.\nThis is the work of the Official Organ and the Publishing\nBoards. As printing is a precarious venture, it is not surprising\nthat Official Organs consume a lot of the money sent up for the\nCause. It was shown at one Baptist convention that $15,000 had\nbeen given to the Publishing Board in five years; that the Board\nmembers had loaned the Board of which they were members\nmoney, and that the local pastors had received advertising for\ntheir local work that would have cost thousands had they gone\nto an uninterested concern. This money was not sent to the\nconvention for that purpose, but the expenditure is justified on\nthe ground that people must know about the work. A perusal\nof the subscription files will show ninety-nine per cent. of\nthe subscribers are preachers who know already about the Cause.\n\nThe Machine, therefore, is no bald depredation, but rather\nthe finesse of connoisseurs. The propensity in the Negro repressed\nby political ostracism surges forth in Religious and\nFraternal activities. And may I add that here is one reason\n\n\nECCLESIASTICAL MACHINES            9\n\nwhy Negro preachers should contend strenuously for the civil\nliberty of the masses, if for no other. The only feasible program\nis one of curtailment and regulation rather than abolishment. A\nreformatory program must have as its objective two things:\ncurtailment of expense accounts and the abolishment of perpetuity\nin office. \n\nIn view of these considerations I offer a few suggestions:\nFirst, That there be in all of our conventions an installation of\nthe budget system, and that the convention and its boards be held\nstrictly to it; second, That all accounts be audited by certified\naccountants; third, That the many missionaries and field agents\nbe abolished; fourth, That there be a limit to the term of office\nof all executives that are supposed to be purely honorary; fifth,\nThat the Official Organ be made democratic in practice as well as\ntheory; sixth, That national meetings be held every three or \nfour years instead of annually.\n\nCORPORATE WORSHIP\n\nTHE task of working out a service of worship, adapted to\nthis particular audience (that of the new Chapel), will take\ntime; and it will require the co-operation of faculty and students.\nOne insidious foe will have to be overcome year after year, viz.,\nthe persistent idea that religion is only an individual affair, and\nthat one goes to church purely for what one may get out of it\nfor oneself. One of the great objects of common worship is to\nsuggest that all individuals are related in a common life. God's\nSpirit operates through this corporate relation of human lives.\nAnd a service of worship is supposed to unite people in this\ncorporate feeling, where they may recognize their relation to\neach other and to the common Spirit of God, working through\nall and in all and for all. This is why common worship is a\ndifferent thing from private religious devotions. This is also\nwhy the faculty and students of a college need to come together\nin an atmosphere conducive to deliverance from all small and self-\ncentered concerns. To produce such an atmosphere no pains\nshould be spared to build up for the Chapel a large and competent\nchoir. Music, and especially this type of music which has proved\nits survival value through centuries, is one of the providential\nagencies for uniting people in one great common experience.-\nPrinceton Alumni Weekly.", "118", 37, 37, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00356", "1893.

However, as dances are infrequent\nin Grizzleville, they were soon absorbed\nin the full enjoyment of this one.\nLike magic, the sounds of merriment suddenly\nseemed the most distracting sounds to\npoor Patesy.

While \neveryone else was absorbed in the pleasures\nof the time, she lingered in the shaddowy\nchurch with its glossy greens and scarlet berries.\nTime had softened the pain at the heart \nand left her subdued and tender.  It is one of\nlife's strangest mysteries that our most shallow\nfaults require the bitterest of potions for ridding \nthe heart and mind of their subtle effects.\nNot once had the offended minister referred\nby word or look to that evening that seemed\nages ago to Patesy.  She thought of this tonight,\nand her eyes suffused with tears as she\nrecalled the incident. Oh, how she wished\nthere was some way of apologizing for the\nfoolish words, but since he had spoken of\nlove, such was out of the question.\n\"Ah, well! some day he may find I'm not\nso vain and heartless after all.\"  Brushing the\ntears away she turned to go, when a sudden\nthrobbed wildly as she essayed to speak.\n\"It was despicable in me; I-\"\n\"Patesy, I love you- Sweet Shrub!\"\nThere was no mistaking the pleading of\nthose eyes.

Thus nature, ever true to its \nimmortal principles of economy, here also has\nmade one of the chief features both useful and\nbeautiful at the same time.  Whether large or \nsmall, long or snub, the nose always retains its\ngeometrical form of a triangular pyramid. Its\nroot, placed between the eyes, represents the\ntop of the pyramid, its nostrils its base.  The root \nis formed by two little bones joined together.\nThe root is all of supple gristle.

GRIGGS \n\nIN American this the twentieth century is an age of industry \nand commerce. It is an era in which money and material wealth \npredominate. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries territorial \nexpansion, independence, and the development of political \nmachinery had their sway. In the nineteenth century the development \nof political ideals and the moral question of slavery \nconfronted the people. But in the twentieth century it is money\nwhich rules the nation; it is economic progress which college men \nadmire; and it is a job which pays a good salary that the masses \ndesire. The genius in books is transforming himself into the \ngenius of industry. The scientist of the classroom is becoming \nthe scientist of the manufacturing firm. The whole nation is an \narena where materialism is the universal sign of prosperity. \nLiving in such an age, men must move according to the currents \nof the time. Every group must secure an economic footing or it \nwill have no place in the new order. To won and rule automobile \nplants as a Ford, is to fashion legislature; to dominate Wall \nStreet as a Morgan, is to get recognition in politics; to own chain \nstores as a Copeland, is to make one's presence in the economic\nscheme of supply and demand imperative. Just at the moment \nwe are not interested in the industrial progress of all the various \ngroups in America; we are primarily concerned with the problem \nof one group which is nearest to our hearts. We are interested \nin the issue of Negro business and the American body politic. \n\nFirst of all, let us consider facts pertaining to Negro business. \nAt present there are over 70,000 Negro business organizations \nof all kinds. The annual volume of trade amounts to over \n$1,500,000,000. Of the various enterprises there are three which \nare outstanding. First are the insurance companies. It is said \nthat the Negro race has 36 insurance companies which do an \nannual business of $385,000,000. Second in importance are the  \nbanks. There are 73 banks with a total capital of $6,250,000. \nThird comes the manufactories of toilet goods. The more prominent \nof these are the Madam Walker plant and the Poro College. \nAs a race we have an aggregate wealth of over $2,000,000,000. \n\nWhat then is the significance of these facts? Are we really \nmaking progress? Does our business put us in a really prominent \n\n\nNEGRO BUSINESS AND THE AMERICAN BODY POLITIC \n\n21\n\nplace in the industrial world? Does it make our race a \npowerful unit in the American democracy? Our educators tell \nme that we have made more progress than any other people in \nthe world, in so short a time. Yes, but that is in the realm of \neducation. Our ministers inform us that we are a powerful unit \nin America. That is in the field of religion. Our insurance men \nand bankers say that we have made a sound start in business.  \nTrue, but they speak simply in terms of banking and insurance. \nAll flatter us with vain and one-sided conclusions. As a matter \nof fact, we have done nothing in business; I repeat, we have done \nnothing! Who employs 95 per cent. of our Negro workmen?\nHow many factories for the manufacture of commercial products\ndo we own? If the white industrial plants close their jobs to \ncolored workmen, where shall we work? How can we live?\nHere is your answer: The Negro owns only two small plants \nwhich make commercial products on a considerable scale. White \nmen employ 95 per cent. of our people as laborers. If they dismiss \nus from their factories we are doomed to starvation. We \nshall walk the streets of the world's richest republic as beggars. \n\nSome say that because of the Negro's ability to work long \nand with cheap wages he will never be without a job. But that \nis not true. The Virginia Pilot tells us, \"Due to the influx of \nforeign labor, and the demand for skilled laborers, together with \nthe clamor of white people for jobs, the Negro is gradually being \ndisplaced by white workmen.\" We Negroes must cease depending \nupon the charity of others. We must create our own industries. \nWe must become economically independent. Then we \nshall have a place in which to make an honest living.   \n\nHow then can we get industries in order to become economically \nindependent? First, we must be stimulated to inventions \nby giving ourselves a technical education; we must learn \nto be skilled workmen. Second. our good inventions must be \ncommercialized and put into factory systems and supported with \norganized capital. Third, we must have men who have the \nproper qualifications to manage our businesses. Finally. we must \nmerge our businesses with corporations in order to withstand \ncompetition. And we must give to the public what it wants, at \nthe cheapest possible price.  \n\nWhat then are the benefits to be derived from this independence \nin business? Will it make us a power in the American \nbody politic? Is prejudice too strong against us? For an answer \nto these questions turn your eyes to the Jew.

L. DUCKETT\n\nOUR colleges were founded by those who had faith in God \nand in man. Notwithstanding many handicaps, our preachers \nand teachers have been encouraged in their tasks until they \nwaked up or walked into a scientific atmosphere. To-day the\nimperative need for our work in science is that it shall be practical. \nThe specialist's feeling is too strong in our colleges. Our \nmodern science halls are too commonly looked upon as training \ncamps for medical men and nurses. There is need for more \nphysicians, it is true, and the waiting lists in our medical schools \nare long; still we must keep in mind the more general training \nrequired for the student body. The science in our colleges \nshould be of such nature that the average student will have a \npositive prejudice in favor of health and sanitation, and be \neager to work for the health of the individual and the community. \nFurther, we need such training on our colleges as will assist a \nman or woman in choosing a vocation. Opportunities are all \nabout us. The farmer who knows something about plant and \nanimal breeding grows cotton under boll weevil conditions and \nraises cattle while pests are increasing. The mother who has\nhad applied physiology knows something about the care of children. \nScience should not simply be taught in order that something \nmay be seen to happen, but to create a desire to know in \norder to live a better life by understanding more fully the world \nin which we live. It must be understood that a woman who is \ndressed in a large apron and who knows the chemistry of foods, \nmeans just as much in a community as the nurse in her uniform \nor the physician in his office. Men and women must realize that \nthey are living now, and not for themselves, but for the community \nand for their children's children who will come into the \nworld facing ever changing and perplexing conditions. \n--------\nMR.

When\na babe is first born the fluid which is contained\nin the mother's breasts is a laxative and is intended\nby nature to cleanse the bowels of the\nblack substance called the meconium; therefore\nit is proper that the infant should not be\nfed, but put to the breast as soon as the mother\nis rested. Colic is not apt to occur if the\nmother's diet is correct. If it does ensue, lay\nheated flannel on the bowels. Do not overfeed\nthe baby even with breast milk. Do not\ngive the baby a taste of everything which you\neat. Babies who feed in this way are prone to\ncolic. Avoid everything acid yourself and keep\na flannel band around the stomach and bowels\n(loose, not tight) for the first year of an infant's\nlife.

Fairness\nwould not allow us to consign him to mathematics courses in\nwhich he would gain little or no power, when in his natural field\nhe might make extraordinary progress. If his aversion is due\ndirectly or indirectly to inadequate teaching or lack of understanding\nthe elementary branches, we sympathize with him and\nearnestly pray for better preparatory schools and teachers. Professor\nJames Byrnie Shaw of the University of Illinois says:\n\"Owing to early inadequate teaching and to lack of understanding\nthe meaning of the elementary parts of mathematics, a large\npart of the entering class in any university or college will come\nin with a dread of the subject, and sometimes a loathing for it,\nwhich will interfere seriously with success in passing a freshman\ncourse, and, what is of more serious import, will pass on to succeeding\ngenerations the idea that it is a branch of the curriculum\nof little interest, to be learned only with an extraordinary amount\nof work and worry.\" What is to be done with this type of\nstudent? We are to organize classes and study groups to help\nhim get his bearing and encourage his efforts. The necessary\nwork and worry will pay large dividends.\n\nDoctor William David Reeve writes: \"The trouble has been\nthat we have spent so much time on the elementary phases of the\nsubject trying to make sure that the child learns everything before \nhe goes on, that we are not able to give him much in advance\nof what his ancestors had. As a result, a number of colleges\nand universities are teaching little in the first two years beyond\nhigh school work.\" He clearly suggests that the teachers are\ntrying to make the students know as much as they do before they\npass.\n\nShould college mathematics be required of all students who\npurpose to finish college? This question is answered emphatically,\nNo. Students may carry enough mathematics in their high\nschool course to include much of the work done in the freshman\nyear in college. If the student has done the work well and\ndesires to use the four years of college for studies foreign to\nmathematics, he should not be required to pursue college mathematics.\nOn the other hand a student who has covered his large\namount of mathematics, and has done it well, shows special\nability along mathematical lines and should be encouraged and\nurged to follow mathematics or a field related to it. But he\nshould not be required to do so. The case of those who are\ndeficient in mathematical ability has already been covered.\n\nA PLEA FOR MATHEMATICS IN OUR COLLEGES     17\n\nDoctor Reeve suggests further that not so much mathematics\nbe taught but more about mathematics. Sylvester says, \"The\nfine arts are four: Plastic, Music, Lyric, and Mathematic.\" Doctor\nStory defines mathematics as \"The art of exact thinking.\" In\npresenting the soul of mathematics to the college student, the\nfine arts appeal should be more often presented. To quote Professor\nShaw again:\n\nUsually no account is taken of the appeal that mathematics should\nmake as a fine art, an art whose constructions are as fascinating as music;\nno account is taken of the philosophical character it has, as a branch of\nhuman thought with continuous growth for centuries, permanent in character,\nits investigations dominating the advance of thought, its results penetrating\nthe profoundest questions of philosophy. Compared with the values\nmathematics possesses of a philosophical and artistic character, its utilitarian\nvalues sink into insignificance.\n\nMany forms of algebraic equations are beautiful architectural\ndesigns when cleverly grouped. The group theories of\nadvance mathematics \"handle ethereal substance\" and are\n\"capable of becoming silent Music.\" Henry P. McLaughlin, of\nthe English High School of Boston, says: \"In mathematics, the\nname of the muse is familiar: it is Rigor-Logical Rigor-which\nsignifies a kind of silent music, the still harmony of ideas, the\nintellect's dream of logical perfection.\" It should be noted that\ngeometry offers an extensive field for rigor in logic. Professor\nKeyser, of Columbia University, says: \"Thinking is not essential\nto life but it is essential to human life. All men and women as\nhuman beings are inhabitants of the Gedankenwelt, they are\nnative citizens, so to speak, of the world of ideas, the world of\nthought. They must think in order to be human.\" Mathematics\nas an art develops man as a thinking member of a large family\nof thinkers. The thoughts they think are of both substance and\nfancy. The satisfactions they bring are mental as well as economic.\nWe agree with Plato, that mathematics is necessary for\nentry into philosophy, and with Omar Khayyam's poetic demand\nthat from a mathematician's point of view we must treat the\ndata of life as they are rather than as they may be or as we\nregret they have been.\n\nThe young men and women who are planning to enter, as life's\nwork, the fields of applied science-engineering, chemistry, mechanics,\nand the like-are willing to take mathematics courses\nand are likely to assume the proper attitude toward them because\nthey see them as means to an end.

Any race or group that \nfor one reason or another does not follow, in large numbers, the \napplied sciences, will have few of its college students choosing  \nmathematics in their college course. The number of mathematics \ncourses in their colleges is a variable dependent upon the number \nof students electing life work in fields of applied science. Find \nscience buildings and even science courses outlined in a college \ncatalogue but accompanies by no proper mathematical courses to \nsupport them, and you will find an institution where men and\nwomen are not getting the proper training for careers as scientists. \nSuch a situation is a serious one. Four years' studying \nwithout the attendant four years' training are four years of misdirection \nand often waste. Professor Harry Rice of Worcester\nPolytechnic Institute said before a group of teachers of mathematics, \nthat mathematics teachers are agreed that students \nshould have a little trigonometry, differential calculus, and integral \ncalculus since these will be of use to them in their daily \nlife. John Perry of England said many years ago: \"In these \ndays all men ought to study natural science. Such a study is \npractically impossible without a knowledge of higher mathematical\nmethods than those of the mere housekeeper.\" As examples \nhe mentions the use of logarithms in computations, knowledge \nof and power to manipulate algebraic formulae, the use of \nsquared paper, and the methods of the calculus. He further says:\n\"I have the belief that the study of physical science and therefore \nthe study of mathematics by everybody, however poor or \nhowever rich, is of utmost importance to our country, not merely \nfor the knowledge it gives but for producing the scientific habit \nof thought, giving to every unit of the population a power to \nthink for itself and so producing the greatest happiness and \ngiving the greatest strength of all kinds to the nation.\"\n\nIf the teachers in the elementary and secondary schools are \nto be better prepared, and the future requires that they must be, \nthe prospective teacher must take more courses and have more \nopportunities to grow mathematically. Mathematics is not only\na tool for science; it is also a tool in use in the more advanced \ncourses. Every new course calls for a drill in topics previously \nlearned.

Develop the \nlove for the soul of mathematics in more college young men \nand women, and more who are financially able will study it as \na life work and create colonies of mathematicians comparable \nto colonies of painters and sculptors. The works of art produced \nin such colonies will be theories which will make possible \na new acceleration in scientific discovery. \n\nWe contend that mathematics should have a larger place in \nour colleges, because, first, it is the art of exact thinking and \nas such is the sine qua non in education; second, it is the indispensable \ntool of science; third, it is a philosophy that challenges\nthe intellectual mind; fourth, it is a body of material directly \nor indirectly needed to better our instruction in mathematics in \nthe elementary and secondary schools. \n\n-----------\n\nTWO great tests in mental discipline are accuracy and \nhonesty. It is far better to master a few subjects thoroughly \nthan to have a mass of generalizations about many subjects. The \nworld will have little use for those who are right only a part of \nthe time. Whatever may be the standards of the classroom, \npractical life will require something more than 60 per cent. or \n70 per cent. for a passing mark. The standards of the world are\nnot like those set by the faculty, but more closely resemble those \nset by the student body themselves. They are not at all content \nwith a member of the musical organizations who can strike \nonly 90 per cent. of the notes. They do not tolerate the man \non the diamond who catches only 80 per cent. of the balls. The \nstandards which the student body set are high. They want  \naccuracy that is well-nigh complete. They may be willing to \nview with considerable tolerance those who break the rules of \nthe school, but they will not fail to mete our condemnation and \npenalty to those who break the rules of training.

Here they grew, in the wildest, \nsweetest profusion in such beauty and elegance \nthat it seems as though this frightfully \nnamed, out of the way spot, was really designed \nby nature as the floral storehouse for \nthe entire state; the very name of the \nplace warrants this idea, in that it was \nharsh and night-marish enough in sound to \nhold creation at a safe distance, Grizzleville. \nWhether the sweet-tangle wildwood ever \nsheltered a mansion built for \"Papa Bruin\"\nand family, such as little Goldie Locks once \nfound, I cannot say, but from observation I \ncan say that such a few strangers ever wandered\nthrough this \"Wil-o'-the-Wisp\" district \nthat the simple country folks rarely had \nan opportunity of realizing how terror inspiring \nthe name Grizzleville really was; that \nsome spiteful fairy was present, though uninvited, \nat the christening, I have always felt \nvery certain.

During the preceding year mighty \nefforts were put forward toward building a \nchurch. For years, in fact ever since the \noldest among them could remember, they had \nworshiped beneath widespreading trees, seated \nupon rude benches, not that this temple was \nnot grand enough, arched above by God's \nown vault snow-capped and blue, hallowed, \nnot alone by breathing creation, but the\nwhispering winds that \"cometh and no man \nlisteth\" permeated with the exquisite incense \nof tender blossoms that \"toil not nor spin\"\nbut faithful hearts felt the need of a permanent \nhome that should stand like the \n\"house built upon a rock,\" independent of \nthe elements, and to-day sees the work done, \nand the care and worry of it all, like an old \ngarment is thrown aside. \n\nProud expectant faces are assembled to \nkneel in the new edifice, and listen to the \n\"oft-told story,\" while their Bethel is dedicated", "23", 37, 37, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00368", "[done, ? top line of page is cut off]\nthe center of things than the other, and where\nto the other only solid walls are seen, to the\none doors fly open on every hand. To find\nthe explanation of this seems most easy,\nas I think.  The difference of view is owing \nto the difference in the relation sustained to \nthe Lord Jesus Christ.  But I can almost feel \nthe reader objecting here, for he says are they \nnot both christians, what then can be the difference \nin their relation to Christ? Simply \nthis:  the difference of their consecration.

If two by\ntwo they would make an effort each Sabbath\nevening to keep one pew full of people to \nhear the preaching of the gospel.  In this\nway they may render lasting service to the \nsouls of the lost. \n  Again, the members of the circle can be a \ngeneral lookout committee among young people\nand make frequent and earnest efforts to\nwin any who are wayward from the sins and\nfolly of the world to the following of the King. \nCertainly this is the end and climax of all\nchristian effort, and the christian worker who\ndoes not have this in mind as the ultimate end\nto be reached is an aimless worker and is only\nbeating the air. \n   Another open door which is entered altogether \ntoo infrequently is a service which \nmany of the king's daughters could render to \nmothers, not their own mothers always, but \nthe mothers of other children.  Let me sketch \na picture.  In a little home, cozy and neat, a\nyoung mother is charged with the care of two\nor three children.  The father goes early to\nwork, returns late.  For days together he\npresses a kiss upon the brow of this sleeping \nchildren and says \"good-by,\" and at night he\nbends over the crib, and kissing them says\n\"good-night.\" For days together they never \nsee him, and he does not really see them. \nWith those children the mother lives through\nthe week from Monday until Sunday, and\nSunday passes without any change and on \nMonday she takes up the round again. \nShe does not get to church on the Sabbath. \nShe has no opportunity for social enjoyment. \n\n[top line of page is cut off]\nhinges. \n I was reading a few days ago that great\neschatological chapter in Matthew where are\nenumerated some signs of the end of our\nworld.  I noted, as I have often done before,\nthe end is conditioned on the preaching of \nthe gospel to all nations.  How few realize\nthe rapidity with which the gospel is being\npromulgated.  If the present rate of advance \non heathen kingdoms be not retarded, it is\nestimated that within two decades every nation\nand tribe will have heard the gospel, and \nMatthew says then the end will be.  Many of \nus in the middle life may yet live to see the great \nuniversal storm when the elements shall melt\nwith fervent heat and the heavens shall be\nrolled up as a scroll. \n  Now, while I write, there are passing several\nchildren. One has been run off the walk\nand has had to take to a muddy, unpaved\nstreet.  He is running at good speed, jumping\npools of water and bids fair to reach the other\nwalk safely, and thus come ashore to good\nfooting.  But just before he leaps to the curbing\nI see other children with waving arms \nconfronting him and driving him back to the\nmuddy street, and I say, this is like life.  For \nwhen a man has been once run off into the \nmud, there are multitudes to help keep him\nthere.  The children who stopped the boy's\napproach to the other sidewalk did it merely\nbecause he was pursued and on the run. \nThis is what men and society do to-day.

Y.\n\n?mundane sphere from time immemorial,\nhas more points in common with these erudite\nphilosophers, who never tire of ventilating \ntheir ideas upon the negro, than any other \nbird, beast or fowl with which zoology has acquainted \nme. \n   Like geese they follow each other.  As soon\nas one announces a mental, moral or physical \nweakness in a certain portion of the race, the\nothers immediately wag their learned heads, \ncrying, yea, yea, verily, verily.  Without the\nslightest individual investigation, they seize\nupon this important discovery and wisely pronounce\nit a racial weakness, when it is in \nreality only the result of untoward circumstances.\nLike geese, they mean well, and their\nhissings do no harm among thoughtful people, \nwho readily see the flaws in their arguments. \nBut, since many good substantial citizens of \nthis great republic spare little time from their \nregular work for solid thinking, these verbose \nconglomerations of specious syllogisms, invented \nto prove false propositions, may be accepted \nas genuine philosophy. \n   A certain Dr. Brinton has lately been engaged \nin proving the mental inferiority of colored \nyouths.  One of the reasons for reaching\nthis remarkable conclusion is the following \nstatement: \"Colored children up to the age of \n14 or 15 years, are as interested in their studies \nas white children, but as they grow up to \nmanhood and womanhood they lose interest\nin mental occupation.  This is due to traits of \ntheir ancestors, which do not make themselves\nmanifest until maturity.\"  The fallacy of\nascribing as heredity what may be easily accounted \nfor by the condition of the negroes in \nthis country is patent to every thoughtful \nperson.  If it be true that colored children of\nmore than fourteen or fifteen lose interest in", "25", 38, 38, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-024:00124", "7\nthe low plane of inferiority and public contempt \nupon which the laws and customs of the South \nhave solemnly sworn he shall ever remain. \nIt is impossible to conceive of anything better calculated \nto discourage a struggling people and to\ndeprive them of every vestige of racial self respect \nthan the contemptuous and wantonly cruel comments \nof the Southern press upon Mr. Washington \nfor dining with the President of U.S.\n  If the assassin of the martyred  McKinley  had \nbeen invited by Roosevelt to break bread with him, \nthe outcry and clamor could not have been \nlouder or more severe. Indeed if the murderer \nhad not paid the penalty of his awful crime \nwith his life and had gone south after serving his sentence in full, he could have received shelter \nand been offered hospitality by Southerners  \n[*and rather than entertain a gentleman like*] would have scorned and rejected [a man] Booker T. Washington. \nThe corner stone of every argument \nbased by Southern contributors to the journal Symposium \nhas been the unalterable and irrevocable inferiority \nof the Negro.  In defiance of History one writer \ndeclares that \"the good old Anglo Saxon race has been \nthe mother of all that has been done in this world's \naffairs.  Above it floats the pure white flag of superiority. \nGod ordained morality and virtue are its  \ncompanions.\"  Think of it!  God ordained morality and \n\n\n8\nvirtue of the Southern Anglo Saxon, in spite of the wholesale debauchery of poor, defenceless slave women for more than two hundred \nyears during slavery, in spite of the frightful \nattacks upon the virtue of black women which have been made ever  \n[by southern white man today] since the war. \n  After a statement has been repeated a \ncertain number of times, men grow to believe it, no \nmatter how tottering the foundation upon which it \nstands. The Anglo Saxon believes in his towering \nsuperiority over every other race upon the face of the \nglobe. Other peoples have entertained the same opinion \nof themselves, which to day must rely upon the past for \ntheir fame. The American Negro has heard so \nmuch about his own inferiority that some really \nbelieve it is true and sigh to be white in consequence.  \nIt is an indication that he aspires to the \nhighest and best and purest to which mankind \nmay attain.  Instead of blaming the Negro for \" the inordinate \ndesire to be white\" Anglo Saxons who believe they have \na corner upon superiority should admire and praise \nhim for it.  At his best the Anglo Saxon is as \nnoble a creature as the human mind can conceive. \nIf he lived up to the creed which he professes to \nbelieve, he would indeed be but little lower than \nthe angels.

[April,\n\nago with a ton of coal, one half soft and the\nother hard. It struck me as being rather\npeculiar, but I had hardly thus reasoned before\nI saw that there was a board at the center\nof the wagon dividing the two kinds of\ncoal. \"Ah!\" said I; \"that is it. The dividing\nline is everywhere.\" I thought of the two\nthieves on the cross, one on either side of\nChrist, and said, there the cross is the dividing\nline. And as the cross was the dividing line\nthen, it is the dividing line to-day. Plant it\nwhere you will, its historic arms part the\nworld. On one side prayer and intercession;\non the other, vituperations and blasphemy.\nReader, on which side are you? Go into\nsocial life and the dividing line is there.\nSometimes we marvel that a line appears in\nthe churches, yet, as between the tares and the\nwheat, the dividing line is there. We shall\ngrow together until the angel harvesters gather\nthe wheat and cast off the chaff.\n\nI stood at the railway station taking leave\nof my friends, but could scarcely hear a goodbye\nor word of cheer for the uproar of escaping\nsteam from the engine. At last I stepped\naboard the train; the baggage was thrown \ninto the car and then a hush fell upon that\nnoisy engine. The hush was so perfect that\nI looked out toward the engine and in a\nmoment more I saw it move itself like a\nthing of life and we were off. I took that\nengine as a symbol of life and activity. I\nsaid, why did not the engine start off without\nabating the noise and tumult? As there came\na moment of calm to that engine before\nassuming its tasks, so I believe there comes a\nperiod of calm to man before assuming important\nactivities. Great births of time are\nnot the loud speaking ones. The coming of\nChrist was out of a prophetic silence of four\nhundred years. The revival of letters of the\n\nthose to whom God had given liberty. This\nwas the mistake of imperial Rome, who\nthought to crush out a kingdom mightier than\nherself. This is the mistake of infidel and\nsceptic to-day who seek to obstruct the way of\nthe King. If men are inclined to forget that\nGod hath a hook in the nostril of nations and\nthat He leadeth them whither He will, let\nthem read over the record of the past. Those\nnations which have dared to lift their puny\narm against the kingdom of Christ have\nfound themselves between the upper and\nnether millstones of His providence, and have\nbeen ground to powder. Rome, the great\nantagonist of Christ's kingdom, lies now like\na wreck on the face of history, her glory departed.\nLet men beware to-day how they\nattempt to roll opposition in the way of the\nKing, for whosoever stumbleth upon him\nshall be broken, but on whomsoever he falleth\nshall be ground to powder.\n\nNIGHT.\n\n(Written especially for RINGWOOD'S JOURNAL.)\n\nSayest thou, \"Night hath no eyes?\"\nTurn, turn thine orbs above,\nTo the diamonds in the sky,\nSmiling down in quiet love.\n\nO, Night! with thy soft light,\nOf moon and twinkling stars,\nThy shadows are dispelled,\nBy many thousand smiles.\n\nSeason of sweetest rest!\nWhen nature sinks to sleep\nIn peace, to dream\nOf hopes and loves and bliss.\n\nO, Night! thy quiet peace\nPervades my restless soul.\n\nPHILADELPHIA, PA, March 6, 1893.\n\nRev.

Evarts Hall.\"\n   But, gentlemen, the youth who throng the eastern gateway of our Law School must be taught that if human happiness depends in a large degree upon civil liberty, liberty itself can not exist without virtue. Character can be developed and maintained in no other way than by denying oneself all desires which reason does not authorize and regulating one's conduct in all things by prudence, fortitude, temperance, justice, and benevolence. Integrity without break or blot and conscience alive and alert- softened by a genial sympathy and sweetened by courteous readiness for service to others-are the attributes of a virtuous character. What name represents these qualities so deserving of admiration in the friend, the citizen, the patron, and the statesman? Here there must be no error in selecting the courtly and brilliant ideal as the exemplar of our youth rather than the plain and simple, but withal composed and honest, features of the maid who met Hercules in the way and repaid his favor with the distinction and power so justly praised by the moralist and so widely celebrated by the poets.\n   We again point to the name above our threshold as most typical and illustrative--not only of the milder virtues of cheerfulness, benevolence and magnanimity, but also of the more masculine ones of constancy, gravity, fortitude, fidelity and firmness; then, too, we find that these well defined traits of character are peculiar to the lineage of him whom we honor tonight, and are traceable backwards through the stock whence he sprang to Roger Sherman and Jeremiah Evarts, and forward to the sons who serve society in the army, the forum and the church and to the daughters who minister to the poor, the ignorant and the afflicted, and who are mothers of families.\n   But virtue is the offspring of knowledge. The will must be informed before it can be virtuously conformed. Man must know the good and the true before he can externalize it.\n   The difference in the knowledge possessed by individuals constitutes largely the difference between them.\n   The difference between nations is said by Buckle to be found in the difference between the knowledge possessed by the great men of each, the directions this knowledge takes and the degree of its diffusion among the people.\n   Whoever promotes learning lives fully up to the dignity of human nature; learning in the mental and moral spheres corresponds to light in the physical world and it ought to be as common as water and as free as air.

His  object was\nto provide in the Government building at Chicago\na separate display for \"the colored people\nof the United States of America to exhibit\nworks of art, field products, livestock, inventions,\nmanufactures, and such other articles\nraised, fabricated, produced or owned by colored\npeople.\"  Had this proposition been offered\nearlier in the session, it would have been enacted\ninto law, but, as usual in al; legislation relating\nto the interests of the Negro, \"the gods seemed\nopposed.\"  This bill failing to become a law left \nthe colored people without distinctive representation\nin the great pageant of the century, and\nthe authorities of the Exposition in doubt as to\nthe best method of remedying this apparent\noversight.\nThe opinion of the press of the country seemed\nabout evenly divided in regard to what the colored\npeople were entitled to in this connection.\nMany newspapers declared a separate exhibit\n[?] which to illustrate [?]\n[?] in the [?] of World's\nFair intended.  the colored folks themselves\nseemed unable to grapple with the subject.\nSuch men as the Hon. Frederick Douglass,\nLynch, Bruce, Cheatham, Price, Cook, Smyth,\nLangston, Townsend, Carson, and the [?]\nbishops and clergymen were tardy in making\nsuggestions, but in due time were conferred\nwith by the Exposition authorities.  Matters\ncontinued in this disorganized state from 1890\ntill 1892.\nDuring 1891, the colored people became restless,\nand as usual began to make their appeals\nto the President of the United States, to ascertain\nwhy they were ignored in this great American\nevent.  They were met with the response\nthat as American citizens they has the same\nprivilege as their white fellow-countrymen, and\nit had been deemed best for the interests of all \nto have no special or separate displays for any \nclass or race at the Columbian Exposition.  This \ndeclaration coming from the Chief Magistrate\nseemed final.  For a time it was partially accepted\nby the colored people until publicly\nknown the American Indians were to have a \nseparate exhibit at the Fair.  This somewhat\nexasperated our people, for is such were to be\ninaugurated there certainly would exist a discrimination \nbetween the Negro and Indian, ex-\n\nand benevolent enterprises for the past thirty\nyears, such as Mr. F. G. Barnadoes, who superintended\nthe Colored Mason's Exposition held\nin the District of Columbia, worked night and\nday to place the proposed measure in a way\nthat it would not be antagonized.  They were\nfinally successful in this, and, as mentioned. on\nthe 18th of July Senator Chandler's amendment,\noffered by Senator Pettigrew, passed the Senate\nunanimously, becoming a part of the general\ndeficiency bill.\nThe measure referred to by Senator Kyle had\nbeen favorably reported in the House and placed\nupon the calendar through the efforts of Congressman\nHarter, of Ohio.  It passed the Senate, \nbut was stricken out of the sundry civil appropriation\nbill by the conference committee, composed\nof Senators Allison, Hale, and Gorman,\nand Representatives Holman, Sayers, and Cogswell.\nIt will be interesting to note from time to\ntime, during the progress of the World's Fair, \nto see whether or not colored people will\ngreatly enthuse over a National and International\nenterprise in which they are hardly noticed\nas American citizens.

Hood, in 1880, and \nhis church labors have been crowned\nwith uniform success.  he has\nfilled with the greatest denomination, proving\nhimself to be an able preacher,\na working pastor and a splendid\nfinancier.  He is an attractive pulpit,\norator, a strong reasoner, and \nat the same time rich in fancy and\ncopious in illustration.  He has\njust built in Carlisle, Pa., the second\nlargest and finest parsonage in\nhis denomination.\nRev.

Rev. Alexander Walters, D.D., the bishop\nwho is now presiding at the 65th annual session\nof the Philadelphia and Baltimore Annual Conference,\nwas born in Bardstown, Conn.  At the\nage of eight, he was consecrated to the ministry\nby his parents and shortly after entered school\nto that end.  He joined the Kentucky Annual\nConference when but eighteen years of age,\nand has been actively engaged in preaching\never since.  Having served in this conference\nfor a number of years, he was transferred to the\nCalifornia Annual Conference, in which he\nserved successfully for three years.  he possessed \ngreat ability as a financier, collecting in\nthis time $16,000.  From this conference, he\nwas appointed to the following important pastorates\n-Chattanooga and Knoxville, Tenn.-\nwhere with his Christian example and fiery\nzeal, he accomplished a great work.  The four\nyears spent in the above cities are telling results\nof his ability as a church builder and\nfinancier.  In 1889, he traveled abroad, spending \nsome time in visiting, England, Scotland,\nIreland, Germany, France, Belgium, Switzerland,\nItaly, Egypt, and the Holy Land.  Served as pastor\nof Mother Zion Church in New York\nfor nearly five years, he being the most successful \nin this church for over forty years.

Armstrong and Gen. O.O. Howard.\nIn 1863, Lincoln immortalized his name by the\nemancipation proclamation; Charles Sumner's\nname is sacred because of his devotion to the\ncause of the Negro soldier; and added to this\nlist is the name of S.C. Armstrong, who devoted \nhis life since 1868 to the educational development\nof the race.  All these named are in the\nbeyond, Gen. Howard alone remaining.\nGen. S.C. Armstrong for twenty-five years \nprior to his death was principal of Hampton\nNormal and Industrial Institute, situate at\nHampton, a town and county seat of Elizabeth\nCity County, Va., on the west bank of Hampton\nRiver, a small inlet of Hampton Roads, two and\none-half miles from Fortress Monroe, and \nseventy-five miles southeast of Richmond.  This\nschool would never have been had\nnot Gen. Armstrong persuaded the\nAmerican Ministry Association\nto buy the land on which the school\nis located.  this association is one\n[?] [?] Church, and\nis located comprised [?] for [?]\npurchased one hundred and twenty-\nfive acres, to which many more\nhave been added.\nThe Institute was incorporated\nin 1870, and in 1872, the State of \nVirginia awarded to it $95,000,\none-third of the proceeds of the \nCongressional land grant, for the \nsupport of an agricultural and mechanical\nschool. The hall containing\nthe school-room, printing\noffice, and boys' dormitories was\nerected in 1870, chiefly by the aid\nof the Freedmen's Bureau.  It is\nin the form of a Greek cross.  At\nfirst the school was designed exclusively\nfor the education of colored youth,\nbut in 1878 or 1879 the\ndoors were thrown open to Indian\nyouth, and in 1892 there were 680\npupils taking advantage of the free\ntuition, and were being instructed\nby 80 teachers, under the charge of\nthe principal, Gen. Armstrong.  \nBeside an English education the\ngirls were taught laundry, kitchen,\n\nFields, of Newport News, Va.  As to Gen. S.C.\nArmstrong, none too much credit can be given him.\nHis heart was in the work.  He was born in\nthe Sandwich Islands, but early in youth came\nto this country.  He was patriotic when the\nUnion needed his services.  After the was he\nwas connected with a branch of the Freedmen's\nBureau at Hampton, and there conceived the\nidea of the school.

There is no \ngroup of citizens in the United States\n which has suffered so much because \nof the lawlessness of the dominant \nrace as we have. And after this \ncommission studies the cause of the \nwholesale lawlessness which has \nmade the United States a by-word \nand a hissing among the nations of \nthe earth, it is going to see what can \nbe done to stop it. Isn't that enough \nto make any man smile who is identified \nwith that portion of our citizenry \nwhich has been the victim of \nso much lawlessness as ours has?\n\n\"But, now that one women and \neleven men have been selected to \nserve on this commission, how in the \nworld can they keep one hundred \nmillion people from breaking laws \nand committing crimes??\n\n\"The president doesn't expect those \n12 people on the commission to stop \nlawbreaking all at once. He wants \nthem to study the reason why so \nmany people violate the laws. There \nmust be some definite reason why \nthere is more disrespect for law in \nthe United States than in any other \ncivilized country in the world.\"\n\n\"Suppose the members of that commission \nare smart enough to lay \nhands on that 'reason', do you think\nthey will have courage enough to \npresent the facts as they find them, \nor will they do a little side-stepping \nand beat around the bush?\"\n\n\"Say, friend, give me something \neasy. I don't like to venture a guess \nabout that.\"\n\n\"A whole lot depends upon the kind \nof people the president has appointed \non this crime commission. Where do \nthey hail from?\"\n\n\"Don't call it 'crime commission!'\nIt will be known as the national commission \non law observance and enforcement.\nTo answer your question,\nall sections are represented. The dean  \nof the Harvard law school and the \nwomen president of Radcliffe college, \nwhich is the women's annex to \nHarvard university, represent the \neducational forces of the country.\nThen there is the attorney general \nand the man who was the attorney \ngeneral under President Taft. Practically \nall of those live in the North \nand East.    \n\nThe the West is represented by \na man from Iowa, one from Illinois \n(he lives in Chicago, of course), one \nfrom California, and another from \nWashington. The Middle states are \nrepresented by Ohio. What about \nthe South?\"\n\n\"Don't worry, dear boy, the South \nhas its quota, all right. Our good \nRepublican presidents always take \ngood care of the South. There are \nthree representatives from that section. \nOne is a gentleman from New \nOrleans, one from Alabama and another \nfrom Virginia.\"\n\n\"Suppose nine members of the \ncommission discover that the real\nreason the people of this country \nbreak the laws in such a wholesale \nfashion is because the South has been \nsetting a bad example for 50 years \nby violating the 14th and 15th amendments \nto the Constitution, will they \nhave nerve enough to say so?\"\n\n\"There you go again. I a neither \na prophet nor the son of a prophet.\"\n\n\"If the national commission on law \nobservance and enforcement decides \nthat this country still continue to \ngrow more and more lawless unless \nall the provisions of the Constitution\nare carried out to the letter, will the \nmembers recommend that the 14th \nand 15th amendments shall be strictly \nenforced?\"\n\n\"Which way is the wind going to \nblow day after tomorrow? I have \njust told you that I am not the seventh \nson of the seventh son. I am no \nfortune teller, either.\"\n\n\"What can we, ourselves, do to help \nthis commission learn the facts?\"\n\n\"We can do a great deal. The National \nEqual Rights league has already \nsent a clear, strong, courageous \nstatement to the chairman of the \ncommission calling attention to various\nforms of lawlessness of which \nwe are the helpless victims. Let other \norganizations do the same thing.\"\n\n\"Well, all I've got to say is, if this \ncommission really reports the facts a \nbetter day for many of us will soon \ndawn. The right of citizenship which \nhas been snatched away from us in \none section of this country will be \nrestored. The convict lease camps \nand the contract labor horror will be \nabolished. Lynching bees will not be \nso popular as they have been in the \nweary, dreary past, for members of \nthe mob will not be allowed to go\nscot free. They will be caught and \npunished for their diabolical crimes. \nIf the Jim Crow car laws are still \nenforced at least the railroads will be \nobliged to provide equal accommodations \nfor all without regard to color\nor race. \n\nThe educational facilities of Colored \nchildren will be greatly improved. The\nschool funds will be more evenly divided \nthan they are today. \n\n\"There is every reason to hope that \nthat commission on law observance \nwill be a Christmas gift to more than \n12,000,000 people in the United States. \nIf the members really tell the cause \nof the many crimes that are committed \nand will recommend the only \nremedy which can cure existing evils \n-- namely, that the laws be enforced \nimpartially for all.\"\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n", "151", 37, 37, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00388", "2     THE COLORED AMERICAN, WASHINGTON, D.

After the sermon a large \ntion\n\nWOMAN AND ANARCHY.\n___\nHer Pen and Voice Should be on the\nSide of Law and Order.\nWoman's influence is vast and far-reaching.\nEvils affecting the morality, politics and society\nof the Nation, have frequently been corrected if\nnot entirely removed, by her persistent, vigorous\nattacks upon them.  Many specific instances\nof her power to mould opinion in the educational,\nindustrial and political world, and her\nsuccess in righting wrongs might be cited, but her\ninfluence is so universally acknowledged,and the\nproofs thereof are so numerous and familiar as\nto need neither argument or mention. \nWhen women, whose power for good might\nbe so great, sit quietly in the midst of lawlessness \nand barbarity and make no effort to throw\ntheir influence on the side of law and humanity,\nthey are in a great measure responsible for the\nexisting evils.  This is especially true, when\nmany of the atrocities are committed in their\nname and for their sakes.  In view of this fact\nthe world has a right to hold Southern women\nto a large degree responsible for the lawless \ncondition of that section.  The frequent lynchings\nand burnings of helpless victims, many of\nwhom are innocent and upon none or few of\nwhom is guilt proved by due process of law,\nmust be laid at the door of Southern women.\nNot a word have they uttered as a body in\nprotest or denunciation of barbarities which\nmake the cheek of cruelty pale.  One of their\nsisters applies the match to a man saturated\nwith kerosene and together with others equally\nsavage and unnatural stands calmly by to see\nhim burn alive.  The roasting flesh and the\npiercing shrieks of the agonized victim, far\nfrom appealing to the tender mercies of women\nwho assist at such atrocities, only whet more\nkeenly their fiendish depravity and arouse\nmore powerfully the low, cruel instincts of the\nanimal.  If there are women in Texas who\nlove order, women to whom such atrocities are\nrevolting, women whose hearts are tender and\nnot stone, the world does not know it.  Such\nsilence on the parts of mothers and wives of\nthat section is criminal.  Only one interpretation\ncan be put upon it.\nThere is no escape for black men who assault\nwhite women in the South.  The tacit acquiescence\nin the lawlessness and barbarities of almost\ndaily occurrence can not be based upon the\nfear that condign and swift punishment will not\nbe visited upon the criminals.  Justice is not\nblind in the South.  Her eyes are not holden\nthat she may not see black suppliants pleading\nbefore her and dark forms kneeling at her\nshrine.  The goddess becomes a fury in the \nSouth, and is terrible in her vengeance and\nwrath.  There is neither reason nor excuse for\nthe silence and lethargy of Southern women.\nThey are encouraging mobs which disgrace civilization\nand which true womanhood repudiates\nand loathes.\nIt is, however, neither surprising nor inexplicable\nthat the Southern woman lacks the\ntenderness and mercy which are the crowning\nvirtues of her sex.  The very food which nourished\nher and her mothers, the luxuries which\nthey enjoyed, were for two centuries purchased\nwith the blood and debasement of the oppressed\nand the brutality  the oppressor.  The dehumanizing\ninstitu  of slavery has so hardened\nthe that neig  the atrocious barbarities\nperpetrated nor the graceful immorality practiced\nby the men m e the slightest impression\nupon them.  The flower of Southern femininity\nis descended from women who could look calmly\nupon the anguish of broken-hearted mothers \n\nFINANCIAL.\n25TH ISSUE OF STOCK\nOpened for Subscription\nand First Payment.\n___\nEquitable Co-operataive\nBuilding Association.\nSubscriptions for the 25th Issue of stock, and\nfirst payment thereon, will be received daily\nfrom 9 a.m. to 4\"30 p.m. at the office of the \nAssociation.\nSHARES ARE $2.50 EACH PER MONTH.\nThe assets during the past 12 months have\nincreased $140,76.49, making the total assets \n$1,455,988.00.\nFor pamphlets and information apply at the\noffice of the Association.\nBy order of the Board of Directors.\nJNO.

ROBINSON, \nVirginia's Editor.\n__________\nThe above portrait is a fair likeness of Magnus\nL. Robinson, of Alexandria, Va., who is now the\noldest Negro Editor in Virginia.  He was born\nin Alexandria, Va., November 21, 1852.  He received\nhis education through private schools.\nHe was a student at Howard University Law\nClass of 1868, but was compelled to give up his\nstudies on account of ill health.  He has taught\nsuccessively in the public free schools of Virginia,\nin all, nine years.  He entered Virginia\njournalism in 1879, and has edited a colored\nnewspaper in his State consecutively to this\nperiod.  He established the National Leader at\nWashington, D. C., in 1888.  In this enterprise\nthe late Frederick Douglass, Jr., was a colleague.\nHe removed the Leader to his home in 1890,\nand has conducted it very successively until the\npast week, when he consolidated it with the\nAlexandria Clipper.  He is now part owner of\nthe Clipper and jointly with Mr. N. B. Pain,\none of Alexandria's foremost young men, edits\nthe same.  Mr. Robinson is a member of the\nA. M. E. Zion Church, a leading member of\nvarious benevolent and literary societies.  He\nhas several times stood as the Republican candidate\nfor municipal honors.  He is now spoken\nof as a probable candidate for the Virginia legislature\nfrom the Alexandria district in the\ncoming State election.  As an organizer and all\nround man in journalism he has few equals. \n\nfrom whom babes were cruelly torn, and clinging\nchildren dragged without blushing for shame,\nor weeping for pity.  If now they are neither\ntouched nor annoyed by the torture and lynching\nof innocent men, is the natural effect of a \nwell-known cause.  Their stony hearts are so\nmany irrefutable arguments for the power and\nimmutability of heredity.  The early education\nof the Southern woman, from which it is difficult\nfor the most conscientious and enlightened\nto emancipate themselves, has neither broadened\nher mind nor deepened her sympathy.\nThe prevailing sentiments of communities, in\nwhich the spirit of oppression and riot is rife,\nthe oft-repeated opinions of daily associates who\nlend a rope, shoulder a gun, or furnish kerosene\nfor the frequent lynching bees, extenuate to a \ncertain degree the lethargy and acquiesence of\nSouthern women. \nPerhaps they have not yet arrayed themselves\non the side of law and right, because the awful\nresponsibility resting upon the mothers of future\ncitizens and statesmen of a free republic has\nnot been impressed upon them.  The argument\nthat Southern women could accomplish nothing\ntoward establishing order and eradicating existing\nevils will be advanced by no one acquainted\nwith the power they wield and the\nchivalrous deference paid to their opinions and\nwishes by the men.  Once let them raise their\nvoices against the atrocities which disgrace the\nStates, let them give unmistakable evidence\nthat the brutal conduct of the men is painful\nto them and the reign of King Lynch is over.\nIf Southern women recoiled from murderers\nwhose participation in midnight crimes is an\nopen secret, the number of their relatives\nand friends whose hands are red with blood\nwould perceptibly diminish.\nThe counsel of mothers, the remonstrance of\nwives, and the entreaty of daughters would\neffect more toward throttling lawlessness and\nstaying the assassin's hand than the tenets\nof justice or the statutes of law.\nKATE KIRK.\n[*Mary C Terrell -*]\n_________\nThe First Grand Picnic of the Season,\nGiven by the National Band.\nEverybody knows of the National Band of\nthis city.

It is obvious\nthat is our true moral and intellectual\nworth as a race, is ever to be known it \nmust be told by our own pen and\nthrough our own press.  If our habits\nof industry and economy, our virtues\nand accomplishments are ever to be extolled,\nit must be done through our own \ncolumns.  That there are two sides to \nour race life we admit.

No man has\ndone more for the Negro race in this\ncountry than has Prof. Langston. Let all\ngood people of Memphis come out and\ndo honor to his sacred memory.\n\nWith the ushering in of the newye a\nNew York became the second city in \nthe world both in point of population\nand volume of trade, and the greatest\nin the world having a democratic form\nof government.  The making of the great\ncity was fittingly celebrated an Mayor\nVan Wick may justly feel proud of \nhis distinction.  For a time the administering\nof the affairs for this important\ncity will be eagerly watched and carefully\nscrutinized as it is expected to\ndemonstrate to the world, to a very great\nextent, the superior advantages of a republican\nform if government for great cities.\n\nThe birth of a Negro news paper is\nalways a new life of uncertainty, for it\nfalls under the law that governs all life.\nNamely the necessity to struggle for existence.\nThe law of survival of the \nfittest is a hard law in the working out\nof the details of all life, but it is necessary\nlaw for the advancement of the world.\nPerhaps it is always true that a\nNegro News paper that can not live\nought not to live but in the many attempts\nto start and maintain a paper by\nNegro journalists which fail, there are\ntwo sides to the question.\nIt is true that many Negro papers are \nlargely filled up with matter for which\nno intelligent man can afford to pay or\ntake time to read, and is such papers\ndo not find a support that would\nmake life possible for them it\nwould be more to the point to blame the\nold and necessary law of the universe\nthan the people who do not furnish the\nnecessary subscription list.  But there \nare considerations which those who de-\n[?] [?] paper matter for [?] pay may\n\nMrs. Mary Church-Terrell\nBefore the Whittier Historical\nAssociation\nThe Whittier Historical Society in\nits Sixth annversity for Dec. 17 announced\nitself with the following phrase\n\"Engagement Extraordinary.\"  Generally\none knows what to expect when\nthe stock phrases announcing the glories\nof comming events are scattered abroad.\nBut this \"Engagement Extraordinary\"\ntelling of the coming of \nMrs. Mary Church Terrell was received\nwith exception in the ordinary\nlist of hand bills, for she is sufficiently\nwell known for excellent things\nto lead expectations in any place\nwhere she would be announced.\nThe people of Memphis expected much\nand were generous in faith towards her\nbecause she is their own.  But how much\nwas in store for them in her lecture but\nfew if any realized beforehand.\nThe subject of her address was Harriet\nBeecher Stowe and her characters.\nOnly a superior may take such a subject\nand make a success. No woman with\nthe characters of her creation is better\nknown than Harriet Beecher Stowe\nThere was nothing new that could be\ntold about her.  But the story is immortal\nand Mrs. terrell retold it so\nwell that it had to her hearers\nthe fresh and all absorbing\ninterests of the tale first told, and in \nthat Mrs. Terrell's excellency as a lecturer\nand artist was set forth.\nMrs. Terrell gained her point and\nwon her way to the end by her skillful\nintroduction.  Without any blast of\ntrumpets or any crescendo from the orchestra\nin the pit she quietly stepped \nupon the stage and drew back the curtains\nand showed the inside of a little\nchurch away up in Maine.  the holy\ncommunion was being celebrated and \nthe mangled and bleeding body of\nChrist was on the alter.  On the memorable\nSabbath day a sensitive and\nhighly spiritual woman saw it all in a \nnew light saw in the bleeding Christ the \nbleeding slave and in a flash to that\nwoman was given the inspiration which\nin turn gave to the world the immortal\n\"Uncle Tom's cabin.\"  So graphically\nand artistically by Mrs. Terrell was this\npicture drawn that she carried her audience\nto the end of her hour's lecture\nwithout their once flagging in interest.\nHarriet Beecher Stowe was well set\nforth with the writing of her great Novel\nas the center and climax of her life.\nThis done a resume of her characters\nwas so well given that those who heard\nsaw Aunt Chloe, Mars George, Eliza\nand George Harris with all the bright \nside of the old Kentucky life.

It may be\nwell to recall the salient facts of this\nremarkable case.  Judge Bailey, of Eau\nClaire, who was a candidate for re-election\nlast spring, objected to certain editorials \nand communications in a local\npaper severely animadverting upon\nhis official conduct and methods.  The\nwriter and editor having filed affidavits\nin contempt proceedings (instituted\nagainst them by the judge), alleging \nthe truth of their charges of unfairness, \npartiality, and incapacity \nagainst Judge Bailey, he angrily refused\nto proceed with the hearing, and\nmade an order adjudging his critics\nguilty of contempt.  The offenders were\nto be committed to jail, but a writ of\nprohibition from the supreme court\nsaved them from that punishment.\nThe supreme court, in reviewing the\ncase, points out the fact that the criticisms\nmade upon Judge Bailey had no \nreference to any action of his connection\nwith the case then pending.  Whether \njust or unjust, they were general in \ntheir nature, and referred to past conduct.\nThe court says it is well persuaded\nthe newspaper comments on\ncases finally decided prior to the\npublication cannot be considered criminal \ncontempt, and that they do not\nobstruct the administration of justice,\nhowever much they may tend to prejudice\nthe judge against whom they are \ndirected.  While it is of the first importance\nthat judges should perform their\ngrave duties unimpeded, it is equally\nimportant that the right of citizens \nand newspapers to criticise what they\ndeem arbitrary, unworthy and corrupt\nconduct should be jealously preserved.\nThe court says:\n\"Truly, it must be a grievous and\nweighty necessity which will justify\nso arbitrary a proceeding whereby a candidate\nfor office becomes the accuser,\njudge and jury, and may within a few\nhours summarily punish his critic by \nimprisonment.  The result of such a \ndoctrine is that all unfavorable criticism\nof a sitting judge's past official \nconduct can be at once stopped by the \njudge himself, or if not stopped, can \nbe punished by immediate imprisonment.\nIf there can be any more effective\nway to gag the press and subvert \nfreedom of speech we do not know \nwhere to find it.\"\nThis is a stinging rebuke, but justly\ndeserved, and one needed to remind\n[?]ogant and dictatorial jurists that\n\nProclamation.\nState of Tennessee,\nExecutive Department,\nNashville, Tenn., Dec. 29, '97\nTo the members of the General Assembly\nof the State of Tennessee:\nWhereas, various matters of public interest\nrequiring immediate legislation is \nare apparent, creating extraordinary occasion\nfor the assembling of the legislature\nof the State.\nNow, therefore, I Robert L.

The application\nof the lesson drawn was made in\na plea for the young of the church who\nare unsaved, and that especial effort\nshould be made for them during the \nweek of prayer.\nAt the close of the sermon the ordinance\nof the Communion was celebrated,\n\nREV. W. S. ELLINGTON.\nAt the First Baptist Church, Rev. W.\nS. Ellington took a text from Luke 13:\n8, \"This year also.\"  he said:-\n\"The old year has been caught up in\nthe flight of time and carried back into\neternity.  Let us rejoice in the opportunities\nthat the new year brings.\nLast year in spite of the early and latter\nrains, a great many lives were fruitless,\nthey yielded nothing but leaves.\n\"Years should teach wisdom.

Will\nyou do the same this year also?\n\"Is there a Christian here this morning\nwho has been luke-warm for the \nlast twelve months?

Many good things\nare being timely and well said by this\nclass of gentlemen which deserve to be\nknown beyond their own congregation.\nRead what they say.\n\nnot take into full consideration, the neglect\nof which contribute to the death of\nsome papers that might best live.  Surely \nno intelligent Negro can fail to feel\nthe need of a good newspaper for his\nown people in any community where\nthe numbers of the race are large.\nThe news paper is an educator and a\ndefender every where and there are no\npeople under the sun who need education \ndefense more than the Negroes.\nIt is a pity that in this Christian\nrepublic of ours that it can be said with\nany measure of truth that the white \nnew papers are generally inconsiderate \nand very often unfair in their presentation\nof the Negroes in their several communities\nin matters that touch them\nmost vitally.  If we were able to present\nour own side by intelligent, manly\nand fearless utterances through our own\nnews papar columns, we would get a \nhearing and respect in their own, that\nis now denied us.  To sustain such papers\namong us is a great task but by no \nmeans so great as we would make it.\nThere are among us men and women\nin every community who are able to defend\nby the pen which truly is ever\nmore powerful than the sword or mob\nviolence and if the masses of our eople\ncould be made to realize this possession\nof the race, which could so advance\nits cause; it would support able\nnews papers through which our strongest\ncould be heard to plead for the right\nand to teach the masses how ro demand\nthe right in ways that cauld not fail.\nTo whatever extent a Negro news paper\npresents itself as a ture teacher, and a\ndefender of its own people it should\nhave an abundant support.\nThe SENTINEL announces itself this\nweek as one come with worthy motives\nand high hopes.  It has provided itself\nwith an editorial staff who will seek to \nfurnish a paper that will commend itself \nto all.\nThe questions of the day, and a faithful\ndefense of the Negro where he needs\nit in news paper columns will be the\nchief things to be seen after, but short\nstudies in art, literary criticisms and\nliterary attempts by Negroes will\nbe things to be seen in the weekly columus \nof the SENTINEL.\n\nThe Commercial Appeal's Almanac\nfor 1898 has just been published.  It is\nvery comprehensive and accurate furnishing\n444 pages of the most useful information.\nThis periodical certainly\nmeets the demands of our wide awake\ncity, and the south.

In short\nthere was in all she said and did the\nevidence of the real cultured lady that\nshe is.  Mrs. Terrell graduated from Oberlin,\nClassical Course with the Class of \n'84.  Her immediate worth was apparent\nin that she was invited upon her\ngraduation to become register and tutor\nin Oberlin College.  this would have\nmade her a member of its faculty.  The\nhonor of this call was great for it was the\nfirst and only such that has ever been\ngiven to one of the Negro race by a College\nof such rank as Oberlin.

Afterwards\nshe went to Italy and in Florence studied\nItalian; having advantage at the same\ntime of the worlds famous art galleries.\nBehind all the culture from her advantages \nwas Mrs. Terrell herself, who\nat once appealed to all who met her aud\nmade them want to know her.\nThe people of Memphis were justly\nproud of this lady who had been a child\namong them and had gone our from among\nthem and become the Mrs. Terrell\nthat she is.\n\nNew Year's morning found the residence \nof Mrs. Wright Moore, 164 Beale\nSt. alight with brightness and cheerfulness.\nThe brightness of the day added\ngreatly to this beautiful home.\nIn it was assembled the Ruth Circl\nwith its invited guest which were ae\nfollows:-\nMrs. Mary Church-Terrell, the hon.\nored Guest.\nMrs. R.

Such an accumulation \nof small wares as many people\ngather about them is simply a weariness\nto the flesh.  Those who collect\nvaluable articles should provide tightly\nclosed glass front cabinets in which \nto store them.  The doors of these\nshould be kept locked, and if they are\nfurnished as they should be with dust-\nexcluding strips the work of keeping\nin order is very largely decreased.\nOf course if one has the means to\nemploy an unlimited amount of help\nand choose to risk disaster, that is their\nown affair; but on general principles\nso much bric-a-brac in a room is not\nonly unwise but an immensity of care\nand trouble.  The [?] [?]ese beautiful\nthings falls the most heavily upon\npeople of small means, who have artistic\ntastes and a little [?] the where-with-\nal to gratify them, and who gather\nabout them more c[?]e and handsome\narticles than they [?] storage space\nfor.  This means days and hours of\nwearisome and painstaking work for\nthe wife and daughter, as such tasks\ncannot, as a rule, be let to the class of\npersons ordinarily employed in such\nfamilies.\nEvery house of any [?]retension whatever\nshould have glass cabinets built\ninto the walls.  They cost but a trifle\nwhen the house is being built, and\nwould pay for themselves almost every\nweek in the year in the time and\nstrength of the house wife.  Lacking\nthis it is well to keep a portion of the\ntreasures packed away, thus avoiding\nthe continual care of keeping them in\norder.\nWhen carpets are banished from our\nhomes and stuffy dust-accumulating\nrugs are no more, hygienists tell us that\nwe will be a healthier and happier people.\nWhile bare floors are exceedingly\nunpleasant to a great many people, and\ncertainly are objectionable on the score\nof noise, they are much easier kept\nclean and have many points in their \nfavor.  The one improvement on bare\nfloors is good matting which is without\ndoubt the most useful and desirable\nfloor covering ever invented.  It\nis easily kept clean and the better qualities\nare surely handsome enough for\nall ordinary apartments.\nThere is a steady demand for fine mattings\nand this demand is increasing for\nbetter grades than are at present produced.\nFamiliarity with Japanese manners\nand methods has brought about a\ntaste for these floor-coverings, and although\nthe style of our dwellings will\nnot permit the use of Japanese mats,\nit is not unlikely that there may be some\ncompromise that will furnish precisely\nwhat is needed.\nElaborate table ser[?]ce makes more\nwork than almost any [?]her thing about\nthe house, but most [?]e who indulge\nin this are willing to [?]he additional\nburden upon thems[?] for the sake\nof the satisfaction [?] they derive\nfrom it.- N.Y.Ledg\n\nthey are no more above proper criticism\nthan any ordinary individuals.

Contrary to popular belief,\nhowever, it is no more frequent\nnor elective in its occurrence than formerly\nIt is simply a new name for the\nvery old and very common trouble\nknown as peritonitis, or inflammation\nof the bowels, which, until lately and\nbefore operative treatment was instituted,\nalways ended in death.\nThe trouble having been traced to the\nulceration or rupture of an inflamed\nappendix, causing the fatal peritonitis,\nthe early removal of the diseased organ\nvery naturally suggested the proper\nline of treatment.  It is, perhaps, not\ngenerally known by the public that the\nvarious foreign bodies, such as grape\nseed, cherry pits and the concretions\nusually found in the appendix, are merely\naccidental consequences of the inflammation\nrather than causes of it.  To \nsuch as never eat a grape without a certain\nmisgiving it may be comforting to\nlearn that it is a very rare circumstance\nto find a seed of the fruit lodged in the \nappendix.  In fact, it is now proven that\naside from the intestinal concretions\nwhich really form in the organ after the\nlatter becomes diseased there is scarcely\nan average proportion of three percent.\nin which foreign bodies, distinctively \nso called, are discovered.  That \nthese accidental or deposited substances\nare not absolutely necessary for the\nproduction of the disease is shown by\ntheir entire absence in a goodly number \nof the most severe cases.  Among the\nlatter may be mentioned a recent instance \nwhich has claimed much public attention.\nThe real cause of the disease is associated\nwith the destructive tendencies\nof a peculiar microbe called the colon \nbacillus, which always exists in the intestine,\nand is absolutely harmless until \nan inflammation or injury of the appendix\ngives it an opportunity for the development\nof malignant qualities.  The \nmicrobes then multiply with great rapidity, \npenetrate the walls of the weakened\norgan, intensify the inflammation,\nand finally escape into the abdominal\ncavity by ulceration or rupture of the\ntube, thus producing the fatal or septic\nperitonitis.- N.Y.Herald.\n\nA Slave to His Senses.\nScheminski- Vat?

Here and there an aged\nman reading a newspaper, or an employe\ndusting a sofa, or a clerk writing\nup the accounts;  but when the curtain\nof the night fails on the natural day,\nthen the curtain of the club house \nhoists for the entertainment.  Let\nus hasten up, now, the marble stairs. \nWhat an imperial hallway!  See! here \nare parlors on the side, with the upholstery\nof the Kremlin and the Tuileries;\nand here are dining halls that\nchallenge you to mention any luxury\nthat they can not afford;  and here are\ngalleries with sculpture, and paintings,\nand lithogrphs, and drawings\nfrom the best artists, Cropsey, and\nBierstadt, and Church, and Hart, and\nGifford--impassioned or placid;  shipwreck, \nor sunset over the sea; Sheridan's \nRide or the noonday party of the\nfarmers under the trees;  foaming deer\npursued by the hounds in the Adirondacks,\nor the sheep on the lawn.  On\nthis side there are reading rooms\nwhere you find all the newspapers\nand magazines.  On that side there\nis a library, where you find all\nbooks, from hermeneutics to the\nfairy tale.  Coming in and out\nthere are gentlemen, some of whom\nstay ten minutes, others stay many\nhours.  Some of these are from luxuriant\nhomes, and they have excused\nthemselves for awhile from the domestic\ncircle that they may enjoy the\nlarger sociability of the club house.\nThese are from dismembered households,\nand they have a plain lodging\nsomewhere, but they come to this club\nroom to have their chief enjoyment.\n\nsault on domesticity.\nHow are the great enterprises of art\nand literature and beneficence and\npublic weal to be carried on if every\nman is to have his world bounded on\none side by his front doorstep, and\non the other side by his back\nwindow, knowing nothing higher than \nhis own attic, or nothing lower than\nhis own cellar?

She systematically decoyed\nhim away until now he attends\nno church, and is on a rapid way to destruction,\nhis morals gone, his money\ngone, and I fear, his soul gone.  Let\nany Christian wife rejoice when her\nhusband consecrates evenings to the\nservice of God, or to charity, or to art,\nor to anything elevated;  but let not\nmen sacrefice home life to club life.  I\ncan point out to you a great many\nnames of men who are guilty of that\nsacrilege.  They are as genial angels\nat the club house, and as ugly as sin \nat home.  They are generous on all\nsubjects of wine suppers, yachts and\nfast horses, but they are stingy\nabout the wife's dress and the children's\nshoes.

The eye soon swelled\nuntil it was useless.  The deer was\nnow showing signs of fatigue.  Wood\nnoted this and thought he would be\nable to hold the animal if he could only\nget hold of its horns.  Watching an opportunity, \nhe soon had hold of the\nhorns with both hands.  For a few seconds\nafter accomplishing this feat the\nhunter labored under the impression\nthat a tornado had suddenly descended\nupon the canyon and was sweeping it\nclean.  As his senses returned he gradually\nrealized that the infuriated deer\nwas viciously trying to loosen his hold\non its horns, and a bucking broncho\ncould not have made quicker or more\nunlooked-for moves.  At one time it\nappeared that the hunter's feet were\nstraight up in the air, while perhaps\nthe next instant his feet would strike\nthe ground with a force that would\nbury them several inches in the soft\nearth.  Again, the animal would be\nwhirling the hunter around in a circle,\nclear of the ground.  Wood says he\nseemed to know just two things--one\nthat he had hold of something, the other\nthat he must not let go.  He doesn't\nknow how long the struggle lasted;\nto him it seemed a long time.  both became\nexhausted finally, and Wood concluded\nthat he would let go and scramble\nto a safe place to watch what was \ngoing on.  The same notion apparently\nstruck the deer at the same time, for\nthe combatants separated without a\nrenewal of the fierce struggle, and the\nhunter soon had a tree between himself\nand the deer.  He made no further attempt\nto seize the animal by the horns,\nbut whenever he could he struck it with\nthe club, and by this means finally succeeded \nin killing it.  The animal weighed \n193 pounds when dressed, and had 14 \npoints on its horns.--St. Louis Globe-\nDemocrat.\n__________\nA Cat That Likes Elevators.\nThe Philadelphia Bourse is the home \nof a very intelligent cat.

C. \nAyer's Cherry Pectoral.  It would be impossible\nto better state the value of this\nremedy than is done in Mrs. Dickson's\nletter, which is as follows:\n\"Memory does not recall the time when\nDr. Ayer's Cherry Pectoral was not used in\nour family, for throat and lung troubles,\nand the number of empty Cherry Pectoral\nbottles collected during the season, told\nwhere relief had been sought.  this\nmedicine was in such constant use in\nmy father's family, that when I had a\nhome of my own, and had childish \nailments to attend to, it still proved\nefficacious.  That terror of mothers--the\nstartling, croupy cough--never alarmed\nme, so long as I had a bottle of Ayer's\nCherry Pectoral in the house to supplement\nthe hot-water bath.  When suffering\nwith whooping cough, in its worst form,\nand articulation was impossible on account\nof the choking, my children would point\nand gesticulate toward the bottle;  for\nexperience had taught them that relief \n\nwas in its contents.\"--Mrs. W.

It had nearly ceased to breathe.\nHaving a part of a bottle of Dr. Ayer's\nChery Pectoral in the house, I gave the\nchild three doses, at short intervals, and\nanxiously waited results.

McCLELLAN.\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nThe Belfast gap in Elk Ridge of Middle\nTennessee was cut a hundred years\nago by early settlers of the state.  This\nroad crossing the south western section\nof the Highland Rim of the State leads \nthrough rich and prosperous districts. \nStanding in the Belfast gap you can look\ntwo ways, and in all, over a stretch of\nmore than a hundred miles.  Looking\nsouthward the eye passes on and\non over hills and valleys, beautiful\nbeyond word, that stretch away into\nNorthern Alabama.  Looking to the\nnorth the eye rests on the lovely basin\nof the state, which extends to the hills\nof the Cumberland at Nashville. Lewisburg,\nFarmington, Shelbyville, Columbia, \nMurfresboro and Franklin are the\nchief towns that lie in the basin directly\nnorth of the Belfast gap.  Lewisburg\nlies five miles distant from the gap but\nas one looks down on its old court house \nin the centre of the square of the town\nand the church spires that are ever\npointing souls heavenward it would seem\nthat one might almost cast a stone down\ninto that sleepy little town. All of these\nlie in rich farming districts, where the\nwhites and the negroes live on in them\nyear after year with all the prejudices\nand social differences common to the\nsouth, apparently in an uneventful way.\nNever the less, on a quiet stage among\nthese people the comedies and tragedies\nof life are played out with all the passions\ncommon to mankind.  There is\none story that is only twenty years past,\nbelonging to the town of Lewisburg that\nalways seemed to me particularly sad.\nAt the close of our Civil War Millie\nStillwell was forty and her daughter\nBarbara was nineteen.  Her husband\nwas dead.  We will call him her husband\nfor Millie's sake.  They had never\nstood before the altar and taken the\nmarriage vows, nor even before so much\nas a justice of peace and been pronounced\nhusband and wife after the ordinary\ncustom in marriage.\nIt was this way:  Old John Stillwell as\nhe was called, was rich and with his\nmoney bought the girl Millie when she\nwas young and pretty.  She was a negress\nand his slave but John Stillwell\nloved her.  With him Millie had all she\ncould have had in a lawful marriage\nexcept honor and in time at least she \nwas satisfied with her lot.\nLet moralists judge her according to\nthe times in which she lived, according\nto the controlling system of slavery in\nwhich she had no voice but was necessarily\na part, and according to the price\nJohn Stillwell paid for her in gold.\nShe was devotedly religious all her\nlife and a faithful member of the Nazarene\nBaptist Church, and on the judge-\n\nold age with Barbara and her grand\nchildren.  There was only one hitch in\nher chian of reasoning and that was at\nthe very beginning, namely where to get\na suitable husband to start off with on\nthis happy journey.\nThere was nothing about Barbara to\nindicate that she was a negro, but the\nfact that she was Millie Stillwell's child\nNow when it comes to matters of marriage\nthe mulattoes from the darkest\nbrown skin to the fairest octaroon are\njust as prejudiced against color as the\nwhitest Saxon that ever lived.  Indeed\nnot only the mulattoes but the blackest\nnegroes have very little use for color beyond\ntheir own natural and individual \nsupply.  This arises from the universal\ndiscriminations against negroes rather \nthan from any necessary innate dislike\nto color.  Millie Stillwell did not believe\nthere was any body in Marshall\nCounty good enough for Barbara unless\nBob Nowlin was an exception.  There\nwas just one objection to him.  Viewed\nin a most chartable light Bob could not \nbe called any thing more than a \"ginger\ncake colored negro.\" Indeed he was\nalmost black.  But then he had good\nhair and was almost as handsome a man\nas Barbara was a moman, and that was\nto say much in favor of his good looks.\nFor a long time Millie haulted on his\n\"ginger cake color,\" but by and by she\ncame to the happy conclusion that there\nwas no choice in the matter. Bob Nowlin\nwas the only man in the county that\ncould be considered, and once over this\nhitch Millie took Bob to her heart with \nall her plans.\nIn these first stages of consideration\nneither Bob nor Millie was consulted\nnor had either of these young people ever \ngiven each other any very serious\nthought, though they were occasionally\ntogether.  Barbara had read several\nlove stories, cried over one or two of\nthem and had had some girlish fancies\nof love that come to every girl of a \nhealthy mind and body by the time she\nis nineteen.  she had a nature capable\nof the most intense love but as yet nothing\nhad ever come into her life to awaken\nit.  She had her share of vanity. She\nknew that she was beautiful and the\nobject of admiration by black and white\nwhenever she appeared in town.  She\nenjoyed it and so did her mother, only\nher joy had with it a dumb dread and\nconstant anxiety.\nBob Nowlin ran away to the north\nsome years before the war broke out.\nHe had picked up considerable education.\nHe was thirty years old when the\nwar closed, and when he came home he\nwas chosen to teach the first Negro\nFree School in Lewisburg.  There was \nnot much sentiment  in his nature but\na good deal of the practical turn of mind\nand a love for the good things of this\nworld.  His school money was turned\nto account on a rich farm three\nmiles out on the Cornersville turnpike\nand in five years' time Bob Nowlin had \n\nBut there is a  ad to all things, let\nthem be joyous  ad. The summer and\nthe autumn pass  by  and the time came \nwhen it was only  weeks to Christmas.\nBarbara wa   o be married on\nChristmas Day. S  e how because of\nthis the little Be  lehem babe was\nthought of with a g  ater tenderness than\never before by Ba  ara.  Just two weeks\nbefore the weddin  day Bob had asked\nher to come over  o his house and advise \nabout some  preparations he was\nmaking for their  ouse keeping.  They\nroad over to his fa m early in the morning.\nBarbara was a little a bashed at\nfirst, but very soo  she forgot all in the\nnovelty of the sit ation.  The woman\ntryumphed.  The  eautiful new dishes\nthat Bob had boug t, the furniture and\nthe pretty new thi gs that were to be\na part of her new life carried Barbara\ninto the seventh  aven.  Nearly all the\nfore noon was sp  t before she started \nfor home.  It was   e happiest fore noon \nshe ever knew and the very last she was\never to have of ke  n youthful joy.  On \ntheir way home a  they were crossing\na small stream  sight of Barbara's\nhouse her pony sli  ped on a rock coated\nwith ice and fe  .  Barbary was badly\nhurt and when  ob leaped from his\nhorse and too h  up she screamed\ntwice from the p   produced in moving\nher and fainte  Robert carried her\nin his arms to the  ouse.  A passer by\nwho knew them   hed into town and\ntold Millie that  arbara had fallen\nfrom her horse and was killed. With anguish\nno mortal t ngue could ever express, \nMillie ran  ome, never stopping\ntill she had come t  her child.  Barbara\nwas still unconcio   with a few neighbors\npresent doing  all they could to restore\nher.  Soon af er Bob brought in a \ndoctor who arouse  her to conciousness\nonly to feel the mo  excruciating pains\nthat came with   movement.\nThu   he first time entered\nMillie Stillwell's home.  Month after \nmonth passed awa  and Barbara lay on\nher bed unable to  ove.  Sometime she\nwas delirious and  orn out with deepest\ndepression,  Throu h it all her mother\nwatched day and n ght by her bed side\nwith the tenderest  ve and compassion\nThe neighbors wee kind and made all\nthose pitiful little efforts to help that\nare so heart felt an  ng those of humble\nlife.  When any on  of them had any\nlittle extra good th  g a part of it to Barbara.\nMany were eager to help Millie\nnurse Barbara, bu  she would let no\none take away from her one hour of care\nfor her afflicted ch    For a long time\nBob Nowlin was ve   ithful in his inquiries\nand attenti   Barbara.  But\nby and by he slac   so little at first\nthat Millie blame   alous and suspicious\nheart. Bu   came with all\nits golden gleam   mortal loveliness\nwhich in t   ed into summer,\nand Barvar    bed ridden\nSoon Bob Nowli    was visible\nto more pers    ie Stillwell \n\nany abled bodied woman could do, and\nBarbara will never be what she was again\nyou know.\"  Millie looked at him\nwith eyes that read his very soul, and\nhe quailed under her gaze.  \"Put it like\na man Bob Nowlin.  Don't be a coward.\n\"You mean as you had not sworn before\nGod and man to take Barbara for better\nor worse, though it was only two weeks\nwhen you had pledged your self to take\nthat oath, now that poor Barbara is\nworse, smitten of God, though her heart\nis the same for you, still full of undying\nlove for you, you intend to cast her off\" \nNow Mrs. Stillwell I did not want you\nto put it like that, but I can not marry\na cripple, no one would expect me to\nmarry a cripple.  I am sorry but I hope\nyou will forgive any trouble I have\nmade.\"  Millie's scorn was unutterable.\nShe turned to go without a word but her\nwrath broke the flood gates of her\nheart and swept all discretion before it.\nShe stopped.  \"Forgive you Bob Nowlin?\nIf you lay dying at my feet and it\nwas your last prayer, I would not forgive\nyou. The curse of God be upon your \nselfish soul.  In your strength and selfishness\nyour are crushing my child under \nyour merciless heel, but as sure as\nGod lives he will avenge poor Barbara.\nI pray his curse upon you.  With this \ngreat bitterness she turned and left him.\nBob Nowlin went into the house, he\nhad no further desire to recon his stores\nand looked out in the darkness with\nforebording of evil.  His nature was intensely\na selfish one and Millie's wrath\nwas so terrible, he half felt that he was\ncursed.  Suddenly he was aroused by\nsome one's knocking at the door.  He\ndid not answer.  He was in no mood to\nsee any one but was much surprised\nwhen the door opened and Millie walked\nin.  She had gone but a little way on\nher journey home, when her great love\nfor Barbara conquered all her wrath and\nscorn.  \"I knew you were in here\" she\nbegan.  \"I have come back to ask you\nto forgive me for cursing you, and I will\npray God almighty's blessing upon you\nif you will only have a little mercy-\nGive me a little time Robert to get her\nwell and strong.  Just come in a half\nhour now and then so Barbara may not\nknow the truth yet, it will kill her to\nknow it now. Just come for a little while\nlonger and that is all I will ask. \"O I'll \nbe willing to do that Mrs. Stillwell if it \nis all understood between you and me.\"\nThank you Robert.  I would not ask that\ni f Barbara was not so sick.\nOnce Millie Stillwell was proud and\nspent many days in considering whether\nor not she could let Bob Nowlin, the\n\"ginger cake colored\" negro seek the\nhand of her beautiful daughter, and\nnow she was a suppliant at his feet even\nfor a few merciful visits.  so low and\nhumble was the mother fallen through\nthe exceeding great love for her child.\n(To be continued.)\n__________\nCWI-NAIN AND OTHERS.\nThe Philologist with Malaria and\nthe Intellectual Drug Clerk. \nThe philologist had an attack of malaria.\nHe went to the intellectual drug\nclerk and remarked: \n\"Will you kindly put me up ten five-grain\npills of cwi-nain?\"\nThe drug clerk, with the nonchalant\nconfidence of his kind, answered: \n\"Ten five-grain pills of ki-nin?  Certainly.\"\n\"No;  not ki-nin,\" said the philologist,\n\"but cwai-neen.\"\n\"I though you said cwi   in.\" \n\nAND THEY CAME BACK. \nFrenchmen Who Became Americans\nWithout Knowing It.\nIt is an old saying that when one has\nonce tasted Mississippi water in New\nOrleans, the Crescent City has a fascination\nthat cannot be resisted.  This is\nillustrated in the case of a gentleman\nof France who lately died in New Orleans.\nHe first came here before the \ncivil war, and in a three or four years'\nresidence attained a wonderful liking\nfor the manners and customs of the\npeople.  During the war the death of a\nrelative called him back to his native\nland--to the place of his birth--Toulouse.\nOf course, at first, he was glad\nto get back;  he met again the friends of\nhis youth;  he sat under his ancestral\nvine and fig tree and drank the wine of\nthe pleasant vales of Gascony.  It was\nnot long, however, before he began to\nbe disturbed in his mind.  A restlessness\npossessed him;  he was not able to take\npleasure in life.  Around him were all\nthe conditions that he considered essential\nto happiness--old friends, plenty \nto eat and drink, an amiable wife;\ncoming to him with agreeable regularity\nwas an ample income from the estates\nof his forefathers.  What was the\nmatter?  He couldn't make it out.  He\ncould not rid himself of the restlessness; \nhe could not find it possible to\nbe pleased with existence.  \"What is\nthe trouble, my wife?\" he said one day.\n\"France does not seem as pleasant as it\nused to be.\"  \"Now, I will tell you,\"\nsaid his wife, who was a wise woman.\n\"In Louisiana, you will remember, you \nused to take every morning before\nbreakfast one or two whisky cocktails;\nthen in the afternoon you would take\nanother cocktail, and in the evening\nyou used to drink your whisky and water\nbefore going to bed.\"  \"I believe\nthat is it,\" said the gentleman.  \"You\nare a treasure.\"  So he went to New\nOrleans for a barrel of good whisky,\nand for awhile he took his old-time \ndrinks, and the restlessness and dissatisfaction\nseemed in a way to depart\nfrom him.  But it was not long before\nhe was again going about the house in a \ngloomy and disgruntled frame of mind.\n\"It is no use,\" he said to his wife;  \"the\nwhisky does not do me any good.  These\npeople here are not the same as they\nused to be;  the manners are not the\nsame.  Since Louis Napoleon has come\ninto power all our good, free-and-easy\ntimes have gone away.  It is all bowing\nand smirking and politeness now.  I\nhave to do this, and have to do that, or\npeople frown upon me.  I am tired.\nI don't know why France, my native\nland, should have such an effect upon\nme.\"  \"I will tell you what is the matter,\" \nsaid his wife.  \"Well, what then?\"\n\"This is it,\" answered his wife.  \"You\nhave become an American without\nknowing it.  Your heart is turning toward\nour old home in New Orleans.\"\nThe gentleman's face brightened.  It\nwas a revelation to him.  \"You are\nright, my dear wife,' he said.  \"I wish\nfreedom of action; I love Louisiana; I\nshall go back to it;  I am become an\nAmerican without knowing it.\" And the\ngood couple did come back, and both\nhave died by the side of the yellow,\nfascinating, incomparable waters of the\nold Mississippi.--N.

T.\nDeWitt Talmage endeavors to draw\nthe line of demarcation between legitimate\nand illegitimate club life in the\ngreat cities.  The text is:\nLet the young men now arise and play before\nus.-II Samuel ii, 14.\nThere are two armies encamped by\nthe pool of Gibeon.  The time hangs\nheavily on their hands.  One army proposes\na game of sword-fencing.  Noth-\ncould be more healthful and innocent.\nThe other army  accept the challenge.\nTwelve men against twelve men, the\nsport opens.  But something went adversely.\nPerhaps one of the swordsmen\ngot an unlucky clip, or in some\nway had his ire aroused, and that\nwhich opened in sportfulness ended in\nviolence, each one taking his contestant\nby the hair, and then with the\nsword thrusting him in the side; so\nthat that which opened in innocent\nfun ended in the massacre of all the\n24 sportsmen.  Was there ever a better\nillustration of what was true then,\nand is true now, that that which is innocent\nmay be made destructive?\nAt this season of the year the club\nhouses of our towns and cities are in\nfull play.  I have found out that there\nis a legitimate and illegitimate use\nof the club house.  In the one case it\nmay become a healthful recreation,\nlike the contest of the 24 men in the \ntext when they began their play; in\nthe other case it becomes the massacre\nof body, mind, and soul, as in the case\nof these contestants in the text when\nthey had gone too far with their sport.\nAll intelligent ages have had their\ngatherings for political, social, literary\npurposes-gatherings characterized by\nthe blunt old Anglo-Saxon designation\nof \"club.\"\nIf you have read history, you know \nthat there was a King's Head club, a\nBen Johnson club, a Brothers' club, to \nwhich Swift and Bolingbroke belonged,\na literary club, which Burke and Goldsmith\nand Jonson and Boswell made\nimmortal; a Jacobian club, a Benjamin\nFranklin Junto club.  Some of these\nto indicate justice, some to favor the\narts, some to promote good manners,\nsome to despoil the habits, some to destroy\nthe soul.  If one will write an\nhonest history of the clubs of England,\nIreland, Scotland, France and the \nUnited States for the last 100 years, he\nwill write the history of the world.\nThe club was an institution born on\nEnglish soil, but it has thrived well in\nAmerican atmosphere.  Who shall tell\nhow many belong to that kind of club\nwhere men put purses together\nand open house, apportioning the expense\nof caterer and servants and \nroom, and having a sort of domestic\nestablishment- a style of club house\nwhich, in my opinion, is far better\nthan the ordinary hotel or boarding\nhouse?  But my object now is to speak \nof club houses of a different sort, such \nas the Cosmos, or Chevy Chases, or Lincoln\nclubs, of this capital, or the \n\"Union leagues\" of many cities, the \nUnited Services club of London, the\n\nOne blackball amid ten [?] otes will defeat\na man's becoming a member.  For\nrowdyism, for drunkenness, for gambling.\nfor any kind of misdemeanor, a\nmember is dropped out.  Brilliant club\nhouse from top to bottom.  The chandaliers,\nthe plate, the furniture, the\ncompanionship, the literature, the\nsocial prestige, a complete enchantment.\nBut the evening is passing on, and so\nwe hasten through the hall and down\nthe steps and into the street, and from\nblock to block until we come to another\nstyle of club house.  Opening\nthe door we find the fumes of strong\ndrink and tobacco something almost\nintolerable.  These young men at this \ntable, it is easy to understand what\nthey are at, from the flushed cheek,\nthe intent look, the almost angry way\nof tossing the dice or moving the\n\"chips.\"  They are gambling.  At another\ntable are men who are telling\nvile stories.  They are three-fourths\nintoxicated, and between 12 and 1\no'clock they will go staggering, hooting,\nswearing, shouting on their way \nhome.  That is an only son.  On \nhim all kindness, all care, all\nculture has been bestowed.  He\nis paying his parents in this way for\ntheir kindness.  that is a young married\nman, who, only a few months ago,\nat the altar, made promises of kindness\nand fidelity, every one of which he has\nbroken.  Walk through and see for \nyourself.  Here are all the implements\nof dissipation and of quick death.  As \nthe hours of the night go away the\nconversation becomes imbecile and\nmore debasing.  Now it is time to shut\nup. Those who are able to stand will\nget out on the pavement and balance\nthe lamp post or against the railings of\nthe fence.  The young man who is not\nable to stand will have a bed improvised\nfor him in the club house, or two not\nquite so overcome with liquor will conduct\nhim to his father's house, and\nthey will ring the door bell, and the\ndoor will open, and the two imbecile escorts\nwill introduce into the hallway \nthe ghastliest and most hellish spectacle\nthat ever enters a front door- a\ndrunken son.  If the dissipating club\nhouses of this country would make a \ncontract with the inferno to provide it\n10,000 men a year, and for 20 years, on\nthe condition that no more should be\nasked of them, the club houses could\nafford to make this contract, for they\nwould save homesteads, save fortunes,\nsave bodies, minds and souls. The 10,000\nmen who would be sacrificed by\nthat contract would be but a \nsmall part of the multitude sacrificed\nwithout the contract.  But I make a\nvast difference between clubs:  A theological\nclub, a ball club and two literary \nclubs.  I got from them physical rejuvenation\nand moral health.  What\nshall be the principle?  If God will\nhelp me I will lay down three principles\nby which you may judge whether\nthe club where you are member, or\nthe club to which you have been invited,\nis a legitimate of an illegitimate\nclub house.\nFirst of all I want you to test the\nclub by its influences on home, if you\nhave a home.  I have been told by a\nprominent gentlemen in club life that\nthree-fourths of the members of the\ngreat clubs of these cities are married\nmen.

He first caught\nsight of the animal in a dense thicket\nat the bottom of a deep canyon. Masses\nof brush were between the hunter and \nthe deer.  Having ten cartridges for his\nWinchester rifle, he fired eight shots\nas rapidly as possible at the animal.\nBelieving he had mortally wounded it,\nhe started down the side of the canyon\ntoward the deer.  When nearing the\nanimal it tried to run, and Wood fired\nhis remaining two shots at it.  Owing\nto the density of the underbrush,\nneither took effect.  Supposing the deer\nwas injured so badly that he could\ncrowd it until completely exhausted,\nand then cut its throat and finish it,\nWood once more started toward the \ninjured animal.  In an instant the deer\ncharged its human foe, who was only\nable to dodge the brute by reason of \nthe thick brush.  The hunter at once\nsaw that the deer was not going to be\nrun down in the manner anticipated.\nBut the hunter, who was out of meat,\nwas determined to conquer the animal,\nwhose hide was alone worth something.\nAn unusually fine pair of antlers also\nadorned its head.  Wood accordingly\nlaid down his rifle, procured a good,\nheavy club, and the fun commenced.\nIn the struggle which ensued, the brush \nfor a space of about two rods was completely\ntrampled down.  Several times\nthe deer plunged madly against trees\nbehind which the hunter had taken momentary\nrefuge. Once Wood dropped\nhis hat, and the deer tried to pin it to\nthe ground with its horns, but fell a\nfew inches in its calculations.\nWhile the deer was thus engaged Wood\n\nTHE HOSTETTER CO. WINS ANOTHER\nCASE\nInfringements on Their Bitters Not\nTolerated by United States Court.\nThe United States Circuit Court for the\nSouthern District of New York, Judge\nTownsend presiding, handed down an opinion\nDecember 23rd, 1897, granting injunction\nand accounting, in the suit of The Hostetter\nCompany against Isaac Sommers and Louis\nJoseph, for infringement on its Trade Mark.\nThe jurist states, in bold and clear language,\nthe rights accruing to the Hostetter Company,\nand the liability incurred by all who\nwould rob them, by fraud or misrepresentation,\nof the well-earned reputation and\nprofits of a business built up by the efforts\nof half a century.  The judge says, in part:\n\"The complainant is entitled to protection\nagainst the appropriation of its trade\nmark, by any and all unfair and dishonorable \nmeans, by any and a court of equity has power\nto grant such protection whenever it is \nsatisfied that an attempt has been made by\ningenious subterfuges, to invade the rights\nof an owner of a trade mark.  * * In\nthe sharp contest between the individual\nmanufacturer, who strives to acquire and\nretain the fruits of industry and honesty,\nand the field of keen rivals, seeking\nto wrest from him the prize of the public\ngoodwill, the inventive ingenuity of the \ninfringer has conceived a great variety of\ndevices for evading established rules of\nfair dealing. *  *  Courts of equity finding \nthat their ultimate object and effect\nwere to enable and induce the retail seller of\na fraudulent imitation to palm it off on an\nunsuspecting public for the genuine article,\nand thus to contribute to the infringement\nupon the rights of the original owner, have \nnot hesitated to apply the remedy.\"\n\nIntuition- What some people claim to\nhave when the succeed in making a good\nguess.-Chicago News.\n\nSoreness of the Lungs\nis a forerunner of serious trouble.

This irregularity may\nbe mistaken for real, organic heart disease.\nThe symptoms are much the same.  There \nis, however, a vast difference between the \ntwo: organic heart disease is often incurable;\napparent heart disease is curable if \ngood digestion be restored.\nA case in point is quoted from the New\nEra, of Greensburg, Ind.

There are\nmany things to discourage us, to be\nsure, but we have some blessings for \nwhich to be thankful.  Not the least\nof these is the rapid advancement made\nby our women in everything that makes\nfor the culture of the individual and\nthe elevation of the race.\nFor years either banding themselves\ninto small companies or struggling\nalone, colored women have worked with\nmight and main to improve the condition\nof their people.  The necessity of\nsystematizing their efforts and working\non a larger scale became apparent not\nmany years ago and they decided to \nunite their forces.  Thus it happened\nthat in the summer of 1896 the National\nAssociation of Colored Women was \nformed by the union of two large organizations\nboth of which had done\nmuch to show our women the advantage\ngained by concerted action.\nWhile it would be interesting to give\na detailed account of the wok done by\neveryone of the eighty-six members of \nour large family, it would require more\nspace that it is right for me to take.\nAt the risk, then, of omitting much that\nwould redound to the glory of the national \nassociation I shall, in a very general\nway, outline the work that we are\ndoing and state briefly what we hope \nto do.\nBelieving that it is only through the\nhome that a people may become really\ngood and truly great, the National Association\nof Colored Women has entered\nthat sacred domain.  Throughout\nthe twenty-six states in which the association\nis represented, mother's meetings\nhave been a special feature of the \nwork.  There has been a determined \neffort to have heart to heart talks with\nour women, that we may strike at the\nroots of evils, many of which lie at the\nfireside.  If the women of the dominant \nrace will the centuries of education,\nculture and refinement back of\nthem, with all their wealth of opportunity\never present with them, if these\nwomen feel the need of a mothers' congress\nthat they may be enlightened as \nto the best methods of rearing children \nan dconducting their homes, how much\nmore do our women, from whom\nschackles have but yesterday fallen, need\ninformation on the same subjects!  And\nso the association is working vigorously,\nand continuously to establish mothers'\ncongresses wherever our women may be \nfound.\nBy the Tuskegee Alabama branch\nthe work of bringing the light of knowledge\nand the gospel of cleanliness to \ntheir benefited sisters on the plantations\nhas been conducted with signal success.\nTheir efforts have thus far been confined \nto four estates, comprising thousands\nof acres of land, on which live\nhundreds of colored people, miles away\nfrom churches and schools, yet in the\ndarkness of ignorance and the grip of\nsin.\nIn some of the clubs of household affairs\nare discussed and instruction as to the\nbest way to sweep, dust, cook, wash\nand iron is given.  Against the one-\nroom cabin, so common in the rural\nsettlements of some sections, we have\nmade a vigorous crusade.  When families \nof eight or ten men, women and\nchildren are all huddled together in a \nsingle apartment, there is little hope of\ninculcating morality or modesty.  And\nyet, in spite of their environments which\nare so destructive of virtue, and through\nthe safeguards usually thrown around\nmaidenly youth and innocence are in\nsome sections withheld from colored\ngirls, statistics compiled by men, not inclined\nto falsify in favor of any race,\nshow that immorality among colored \nwomen is not so great as among women\nin countries like Austria, Italy, Germany\nSweden, and France.\n\ndred dollars, which its founders hope\nwill soon be increased.\nBy some of the association organizations\ncharitable institutions have been\nestablished and are either supported entirely\nor partially by the members.  Notable \namong these is the Old Folks'\nHome of Memphis, Tenn.  Mr. Merg's\ninstitute is an excellent example of a\nwork originated and carried into successful\nexecution by a colored woman\nwho is president of the organization in \nthat place.  The school was established\nfor the benefit of colored people on the \nplantations in the black belt of Alabama,\nBecause of the 700,000 Negroes\nliving in that state probably ninety percent\nare outside of the cities.  Waugh\nwas selected because in the township of\nMr. Meigs the population is practically\nall colored.  Insctruction given in this\nschool is of the kind best suited to the\nneeds of the people for whom it was\nestablished.  Along with their scholastic\ntraining girls are taught everything pertaining\nto the management of the home,\nwhile the boys learn practical farming, carpentering,\nwheelwrighting, blacksmithing\nand have some military training.\nHaving started with almost nothing\nonly nine years ago the trustees of the\nschool now own nine acres of land and\nfive buildings in which two thousand\npupils have received instruction, all\nthrough the courage and industry and\nsacrifice of one good woman.\nThe Chicago clubs are all active, earnest\nand progressive.  One of them puts\nforth all of its efforts in the rescue of\nfallen women and tempted girls.\nQuestions affecting our legal status as\na race are constantly agitated by our\nwomen.  In Louisiana and Tennessee\ncolored women have several times petitioned\nthe legislatures of their respective\nstates to repeal the obnoxious Jim Crow\ncar laws, nor will any stone be left unturned\nuntil this iniquitous and unjust \nenactment be forever wiped from the\nstatutes of the South.  Against the barbarous\nConvict Lease system of Georgia, \nof which Negroes, especially the female\nprisoners, are the principal victims,\nthe women of the national association\nare waging a ceasless war.\nBut with all the efforts put forth to\nuplift our race we feel that the one thing\nneedful to accomplish most rapidly and\neffectively, the purpose for which we organized,\nhas not yet been done.  As an \norganization of women nothing lies\nnearer our hearts than the children.  It\nis the kindergarten we need.  Free kindergartens \nin every city and hamlet in \nthis broad land we must have if the\nchildren are to receive from us what it\nis our duty to give.  Already kindergartens\nhave been established and successfully \nmaintained by several organizations\nfrom which the most encouraging\nreports have come.  May their worthy\nexample be emulated till in no branch\nof the association shall the children of\nthe poor, at least, be deprived of the\nblessings which flow from the kindergarten\nalone.  The more unfavorable\nthe environment of children the more\nnecessary is it that steps be taken to \ncounteract baleful influences on innocent\nvictims.  How imperative is it,\nthen, that as colored women we inculcate\ncorrect principles and set good examples\nfor our own youth whose little\nfeet will have so many thorny paths of\nprejudice temptation and injustice to\ntread.\nThe colored youth is vicious, we are\ntold, and statistics showing the multitude\nof our boys and girls who crowd\nthe penitentiaries and fill the jails appal\nand dishearten us.  But side by side with \nthese facts and figures of crime I would\nhave pictured miserable hovels from\nwhich these youthful criminals come.\nMake a tour of the settlements of colored \npeople, who in many of our cities\nare relegated to the most noisome sections\npermitted by the municipal government\nand behold the mites of humanity \nwho infect them.  Here are our\nlittle ones, the future representatives of\nthe race, fairly drinking in the pernicious\nexamples of their elders, coming\nin contact with nothing but ignorance\nand crime, till at the age of six evil\nhabits are formed which no amount of\ncivilizing or christianizing can ever\ncompletely break.  Listen to the cry of\nour children.  In imitation of the example\nset by the great teacher of men, who\ncould not offer himself as a sacrifice\nuntil he had made an eternal plea for the\ninnocence and helplessness of childhood,\ncolored women should everywhere\nreach out after the waifs and\nstrays who without their aid may be\ndoomed to lives of evil and shame.\nAs our organization, the National As-\n\n\nI do not obje[?] to it. But where the\nboy or girl is w [?] rking hi [?] way through\nschool and the parent, [?] I have observed\nin hundred[?] of cas[?], spends his\ntime idly or spend[?] his money for unnecessary\nthings, is a [?] to inflict\nsuch hardships upon our' [?]uth.  I have\nno faith in the doctri[?] [?] is best to\nthrow the youth up[?] [?] own resources.  \nIt is unnatu[?] [?]ndemened by\nthe laws of God and m[?] . The farmer\ncould with as much sense plant his\ngrain, see it germinate, turn it over to\nthe mercy of the elements, sit down and\nexpect full granaries.\nThe cost of tuition and board, where \nthe student pays all of his expenses, including\nfurnished room, table board,\nlights, fires, washing, physician, and hospital \nfees, etc., is only $52.50 a year at\nNormal.  It is about the same in most\nschools of this character.  It is $75 to\n$100 for schools of the grade of Fisk \nUniversity.  To this may be added the\nliberal allowance of $40 per school year\nof nine months for incidentals, including\nclothing, books, etc.  So we may\nconclude that from $92.50 to $140 per \nyear will pay a student through school\nand give him leisure for study.  Most of\nour Normal courses cover a period of\nthree years, which would bring the cost \nof such education at from $277.50 to\n$420.  Graduation from the Normal\ncourse gives a young person sufficient\ntraining and education to help him\nthrough life, taking only the utilitarian\nview of it.\nNow let us inquire: (7) How much\nof above estimated expenses is\nborne by the parent? (2) How much \nby the student? (3) How much by \ncharitable people on the scholarship plan,\nand then (4) how much remains unpaid?\nBut as we are now dealing with \nthe parent and child we dismiss the others.\nThe parent pays less than one-\nhalf of the expenses of students in the\nnormal schools.  Indeed, I think one-\nthird would be a liberal estimate.  Charitable\npeople, student labor and unpaid\naccounts represent fully two-thirds of\nthe expenses of students in our normal\nschools.  This speaks volumes for student\nlabor, volumes for charity and volumes \nfor the indulgence of creditors;\nbut very poorly for the parents.  I am\naware that these statements will be challenged\nby some person who will seek a\nkind of cheap popularity with parent at\nthe expense of the child and future generations.\nBut I speak the truth, as I \nhave seen it during thirty-one years of\nexperience in the school room.\nIt is wrong to burden the student with\nthe mental work necessary to education, \nwith the manual labor necessary to\nlearning a trade and then the hard task\nof providing means for his books, clothing,\netc.  A certain amount of leisure\nand exemption from burdens and\nstrains is absolutely necessary for the\n\nstruggles for education. Present processes\nwill not only tend to lower the\ngrade of scholarship, but will lessen respect\nfor the college and university and\nfor deep and profound learning.  A\nrace had just as well attempt to lay aside\nthe hammer and the saw, the shovel and\nthe hoe, the washtub and the needle, as\nto discard the college and the university.\nThe youth must be assisted into\na knowledge and use of all.\nIf our youth are failures when they\nleave school is it not often the fault of\nhard struggle in school, so that in haste\nto \"get through\" many essential details\nof a good education are neglected?  A\nyoung person who has to drag himself\nthrough school \"somehow\" or depend\nupon charity has not that boldness and\nself-assertion so absolutely necessary to\nsuccess and which is seen in the well\nbalanced young person whose parents,\nhis proper supporters, gave him that\nstrong id which can only come from\nthe parent.  If we will give our youth\nthat moral and financial support which\nthey should receive from us, I doubt if\nwe will find as many as 1 per cent.\nweaklings among them when they leave\nschool.  They will go forth encouraged,\nmanly young men and womanly young \nwomen, and not with a cowardly, slavish\nsense of obligation or under-estimation\nof their own worth.  It is just as\ndangerous to place a low, mean estimation\nupon one's self as it is to over-estimate \none's value.  Indeed, our salvation\nlies in putting into our youth a manly,\nnoble, self-respecting, ambitious character.\nI have not changed my views one jot\nor title on industrial education in the\nlast fifteen years.  But there is a painful\nharmful misconception of the mission of\nthe industrial school.  This false idea\nseeks not only to consign the youth in\nschool, but the entire race to a life of\nabject, ignorant drudgery.  The idea of\ndrudgery work in the industrial school\nis becoming dangerous.  the youth who\nis learning a trade needs time for actual\nstudy and reflection on the principles of\nthat trade, as he does for his lessons in\nliterary branches.  But he is usually \nrushed for time for study in the ordinary\nbranches, then rushed for time to\nstudy his trade; or under the popular\nidea of the \"practical\" he is forced into\nthe merest drudgery for means of support\nin school.  He has no time for\nsolid, substantial thought along either\nindustrial or literary lines.  Is it, then,\na matter of surprise that so many do\nnot succeed?  Yea, it is amazing that so\nmany do succeed so well.\nI want the boy or girl studying carpentry,\nshoemaking, sewing, agriculture\nto have the same time for reflection as\nthe boy or girl who studies law, medicine,\ntheology, pedagogy.  Only in this\nway can we elevate the cook-pot, the\nneedle, the saw, the spade, the plow and\nthereby ennoble and dignify labor.  Why\n\nprepared by the Spanish army.  It was\nnot long before the Seventy-first, either\nfrom fright or from the steady rain of\nshot and shell, went to pieces and was\nswept from the battlefield.  Then it was\nthat the gallant old Twenty-fifth Infantry\nsaved the American flag from dishonor\nand the American army from disgrace.\nIt is reported that a Spanish\nofficer said to a United States officer\nthat \"if you will take the Negro soldiers\noff the field we will whip the whole\nUnited States army.\"\nIt had not been more than six weeks\nsince these Chattanooga \"yaps\" had refused\nto sell those brave boys a glass of\nsoda water or a glass of beer in a tenth-\nrate saloon.  Although on their way to\nsave the nation's honor they were herded\ninto Jim Crow cars and made to ride \nas cattle.  Chaplain T.G. Stewart,\nthough ranking as captain in the army,\nalso was compelled to travel to and\nfrom the park with his family with the\ncommon herd and not permitted to\ntravel as a United States Officer.\nAt this writing about 1,500 colored\nsolored soldiers are encamped at Chickamauga,\ntwelve miles from this city.  A\nmore gentlemanly set of men we have\nnever seen.  I do not exaggerate when\nI say that they are angles when compared\nwith the while soldiers who were\nin camp here last summer.  The white\nsoldiers were a terror to the city, and\nit was dangerous for a woman of any\ncolor to walk the streets, even in the \ndaytime.  Many white ladies were grossly\ninsulted by those ruffians, not only on\nthe streets, but in the stores.  It was a\ncommon thing for those scalawags to \nseize a woman on the street and kiss\nher.  They lay around on the streets like \nany other hog, drunk as beasts, wallowing\ni ntheir own vomit.\nI have not seen a drunken Negro soldier\nsince last spring.  So for from being \nconsidered toughs, there have been\na series of entertainments given by the\npeople of this city complimentary to the\nsoldiers.  The other day Lieutenant\nProctor, colored, called a \"hill billy\"\ndown for not saluting him (Proctor).\nand had the little upstart marched off\nto the guardhouse.  Quite a little breeze\nwas started by this action on the part\nof the Negro officer, but Proctor having \nthe federal government at his back,\nthe little \"one-gallus\" newspaper reporters\nshut their mouths in short orders.  \nProctor, according to last reports,\nwas still wearing shoulder straps, representing\nthat he is a commissioned officer\nin the army of the greatest nation\non earth.\nThe Mayor of this city is reported to\nhave written letters to the Department\nasking for the removal of the Negro\ntroops on account of their conduct.  he \ndoes not say what sort of \"conduct.\"\nBut it is fair to presume, if we accord\nthe Mayor the credit of being honest,\nthat he would have them removed on\naccount of their excellent conduct.  The\ncontrast is so great between the deportment\nof these colored soldiers and that\nof the 50,000 volunteers last summer\nthat it is probable the Mayor would\nhave these conditions removed.  Poor\nold Chattanooga!  She shouted herself\nhoarse when the army took quarters at \nChickamauga.   Then she cursed the\nwhole thing out, because their presence\nwas so demoralizing; then she swore\nand damned because other cities got an\nopportunity to reap some of the lucre\nfrom Uncle Sam's boys.  then she\nsmiled when the Eighth Regiment and\nIndiana troops were billed to encamp at\nthe park; and now the Mayor of the\ncity has appointed himself a committee\nof one to dictate to the War Department\nto ship the whole thing away because\na mere man (white) got killed in\na dive where some colored soldiers happened\nto be passing.  It is gratifying,\nhowever, to know, according to the\nMayor's own statement, that the Department\nhas treated his communication\nwith silent contempt.\nWhat does the federal government\nknow or care about the Mayor of a \ntenth class town like Chattanooga?  The\nUnited States is a great big affair, and\na man who thinks that Uncle Sam\nwould move 1,500 soldiers at an expense\nof thousands of dollars just to gratify\nthe desires of a Mayor of a burg like\nChattanooga ought to get his school\nbooks and study Child's History of the \nUnited States. In the meantime Negro\ncaptains and lieutenants walk the streets\nof Chattanooga unmolested.\nSergeant Allen, who is (falsely) accused\nof shooting the white man, languishes\nin the county jail, waiting the\nnext term of the circuit court.\nI am not posted on international law,\nbut I do not think there is any other nation\nthat allows the civil authorities to\nhandle soldiers in the same way and on\n\n\n\n\n\n", "56", 37, 37, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00401", "gained by concerted action.\nWhile it would be interesting to give\na detailed account of the work done by\nevery one of the eighty-six members of\nour large family, it would require more\nspace than it is right for me to take.\nAt the risk, then, of omitting much that\nwould redound to the glory of the national\nassociation I shall, in a very general \nway, outline the work that we are\ndoing and state briefly what we hope\nto do.\nBelieving that it is only through the\nhome that a people may become really\ngood and truly great, the National Association \nof Colored Women has entered \nthat sacred domain.  Throughout\nthe twenty-six states in which the association\nis represented, mother's meetings\nhave been a special feature of the\nwork.  There have been a determined\neffort to have heart to heart talks with\nour women, that we may strike at the\nroot of evils, many of which lie at the\nfireside.  If the women of the dominant\nrace with all the centuries of education,\nculture and refinement back of\nthem, with all their wealth of opportunity\never present with them, if these\nwomen feel the need of a mother's congress\nthat they may be enlightened as\nto the best methods of rearing children\nan dconducting their homes, how much\nmore do our women, from whom \nschackles have but yesterday fallen, need\ninformation on the same subjects!  And\nso the association is working vigorously\nand continuously to establish mothers'\ncongresses wherever our women may be\nfound. \nBy the Tuskegee Alabama branch\nthe work of bringing the light of knowledge\nand the gospel of cleanliness to\ntheir benefited sisters on the plantations\nhas been conducted with signal success.\nTheir efforts have thus far been confined \nto four estates, comprising thousands\nof acres of land, on which live\nhundreds of colored people, miles away\nfrom churches and schools, yet in the\ndarkness of ignorance and the grip of\nsin.\nIn some of the clubs household affairs\nare discussed and instruction as to the\nbest way to sweep, dust, cook, wash \nand iron is given.  Against the one-room\ncabin, so common in the rural\nsettlements of some sections, we have\nmade a vigorous crusade.  When families\nof eight or ten men, women and\nchildren are all huddled together in a \nsingle apartment, there is little hope of\ninculcating morality or modesty.  And\nyet, in spite of their environments which\nare so destructive of virtue, and through\nthe safeguards usually thrown around\nmaidenly youth and innocence are in\nsome sections withheld from colored\ngirls, statistics compiled by men, not inclined\nto falsify in favor of any race,\nshow that immorality among colored \nwomen is not so great as among women\nin countries like Austria, Italy, Germany,\nSweden and France. \nThe Washington League has in operation\na training class for kindergartens,\nsewing classes for children, a mending\nbureau and a day nursery.  Much the\nsame kind of work is done by the\nKansas City League, Missouri; the Woman's\nEra Club, of Boston;  the Womans' \nLoyal Union, of New York, and\nother organizations. \nThe Phyllis Wheatley Club, of New\nOrleans, has in two short years succeeded\nin establishing a sanitarium and\na training school for nurses. The conditions\nwhich caused the colored women\nof New Orleans to choose\nthis special field in which to\noperate are such as exist in\nmany other sections of our land.  From\nthe city hospitals colored doctors are \nexcluded altogether, not even being allowed\nto practice in the colored wards,\nand colored patients, no matter how\nwealthy, are not received at all, unless\nthey are willing to go into the charity\nwards.  Thus the establishment of a \nsanatorium answers a variety of purposes.\nIt affords colored medical students\nan opportunity of gaining a practical\nknowledge of their professions,\nand it furnishes a well-equipped establishment\nfor colored patients who do\nnot care to go into the charity wards\nof the public hospital.  The daily clinics\nhave been a great blessing to the poor.\nIn the operating department, supplied\nwith all the modern appliances, more\nthan two hundred operations have been\nperformed last winter all of which resulted\nsuccessfully under the colored \nsurgeon-in-chief.  Of the nurses who\nhave registered some have already\npassed an examination before the state\nmedical board of Louisiana and are now \npracticing their profession.  During the\nNew Orleans yellow fever epidemic of\n1897 the Phyllis Weatley nurses were in\nconstant demand.  The best proof of the \nsuccess of the sanitarium is that the city\nof New Orleans has recently promised\nit an annual appropriation of two hun- \n\ncolored women have several time petitioned\nthe legislatures of their respective\nstates to repeal the obnoxious Jim Crow \ncar laws, nor will any stone be left unturned\nuntil this iniquitous and unjust\nenactment be forever wiped from the\nstatutes of the South.  Against the barbarous\nConvict Lease system of Georgia,\nof which Negroes, especially the female\nprisoners, are the principal victims,\nthe women of the national associat on\nare waging a ceasless war.\nBut with all the efforts put forth to\nuplift our race we feel that the one thing\nneedful to accomplish most rapidly and\neffectively, the purpose for which we organized,\nhas not yet been done.  As an\norganization of women nothing lies\nnearer our hearts than the children.  It\nis the kindergarten we need.  Free kindergartens\nin every city and hamlet in\nthis broad land we must have if the\nchildren are to receive from us what it\nis our duty to give.  Already kindergartens \nhave been established and successfully\nmaintained by several organizations\nfrom which most encouraging\nreports have come.  May their worthy\nexample be emulated till in no branch\nof the association shall the children of\nthe poor, at least, be deprived of the\nblessings which flow from the kindergarten\nalone.  The more unfavorable\nthe environment of children the more\nnecessary is it that steps be taken to \ncounteract baleful influences on innocent\nvictims.  How imperative is it,\nthen, that as colored women we inculcate\ncorrect principles and set good examples\nfor our own youth whose little\nfeet will have so many thorny paths of\nprejudice  temptation and injustice to\ntread.\nThe colored youth is vicious, we are\ntold, and statistics showing the multitude\nof our boys and girls who crowd\nthe penitentiaries and fill the jails appal\nand dishearten us.  But side by side with \nthese facts and figures of crime I would\nhave pictured the miserable hovels from \nwhich these youthful criminals come.\nMake a tour of the settlements of colored\npeople, who in many of our cities \nare relegated to the most noisome sections\npermitted by the municipal government\nand behold the mites of humanity\nwho infect them.  Here are our\nlittle ones, the future representatives of\nthe race, fairly drinking in the pernicious\nexamples of their elders, coming\nin contact with nothing but ignorance\nand crime, till at the age of six evil\nhabits are formed which no amount of\ncivilizing or christianizing can ever\ncompletely break.  Listen to the cry of\nour children.  In imitation of the example\nset by the great teacher of men, who\ncould not offer himself as a sacrifice\nuntil he made an eternal plea for the\ninnocence and helplessness of childhood,\ncolored women should everywhere\nreach out after the waifs and\nstrays who without their aid may be\ndoomed to lives of evil and shame.\nAs our organization, the National Association\nof Colored Women, feels that\nthe establishment of free kindergarten is\nthe special mission which it is called to\nfulfill.  So keenly are we to the necessity\nof rescuing our little ones whose\nnoble qualities are deadened and\ndwarfed by the very atmosphere which\nthey breath, the officers of the associations\nare now trying to secure means\nwith which to send out a kindergarten\norganizer, whose duty it shall be to\narouse the conscience of our women on\nthis subject and establish kindergartens\nwherever funds therefore can be secured.\nAnd so, lifting as we climb, onward\nand upward we go, struggling and striving\nand hoping that the buds and blossoms\nof our desires will burst into glorious\nfruition ere long.  With courage,\nborn of success achieved in the past,\nwith a keen sense of responsibility\nwhich we shall continue to assume, we\nlook forward to a future large with\npromise and hope.\nMARY CHURCH TERRELL.\nPresident of National Association of\nColored Women.\n\nA Plea for Our Youth.\nGive Them More Encouragement in\nTheir Struggles for Education--The\nTruth as It Is.\n\nPROF. W. H. COUNCILL\n\nIn an earlier number of Lynk's Magazine, \nI wrote on \"Occupations for Negro\nYouth.\"  I wish to present a few\nthoughts which stand behind my former\narticle.  Then I spoke of the hardships\nof the Negro youth after leaving\nschool.  Now I wish to speak of the\nhardships of the Negro youth in school.\nWe do not help our young people\nenough while they are in school.  In\nthousands of cases they are left to shift\nfor themselves.  Where there is a necessity\nfor such a life-and-death struggle,\n\npaid?  But as we are not dealing with\nthe parent and child we dismiss the others.\nThe parent pays less than one-half\nof the expenses of students in the\nnormal schools.  Indeed, I think one-third\nwould be a liberal estimate.  Charitable\npeople, student labor and unpaid\naccounts represent  fully two-thirds of\nthe expenses of students in our normal\nschools.  This speaks volumes for student\nlabor, volumes for charity and volumes\nfor the indulgence of creditors; \n\nMARY CHURCH-TERRELL,\nWashington, D. C.,--President National Association of Colored Women.\n\nbut very poorly for the parents.  I am\naware that these statements will be challenged\nby some person who will seek a\nkind of cheap popularity with parent at\nthe expense of the child and future generations.\nBut I speak the truth, as I \nhave seen it during thirty-one years of\nexperience in the school room.\nIt is wrong to burden the student with\nthe mental work necessary to education,\nwith the manual labor necessary to\nlearning a trade and then the hard task\nof providing means for his books, clothing,\netc.  A certain amount of leisure\nand exemption from burdens and\nstrains is absolutely necessary for the\ndevelopment of strong, mental and\nphysical manhood and womanhood.\nBecause a few youths of unusual mental\nand physical powers and endurance\nbeat down opposition and rise in spite\nof depressing and unfavorable conditions,\nit is no argument for placing\nheavy burdens upon the entire youth of\nthe race.  We would be justified in saying\nthat while adversity brings out\nmany noble and manly traits of character,\nyet many a successful youth had\nmuch that would lift the world higher\nkept in the background and even\nchoked and crushed by hard circumstances.\nIt is true that more noble \nyoung minds are permanently injured\nby hardships than are elevated by trial\nand adversity.  Every one who has had\nto come up \"through great tribulation\"\nis a friend to struggling youth.  Why?\nBecause he recognizes in himself many\nfailures due to lack of opportunity and\nto discouraging environments.  I struggle\nand pray every day of my life to\ngive young people a better chance than\nI had.  I do not want my boy, nor any\nother boy, to have the same bitter experience\nwhich marked my early efforts.\nI have slept in a cotton pen a whole\nwinter because I had no better place.  I\nhave washed an only shirt and then sat\ndown in the shade of a tree while it\ndried.  I wore a pair of \"Yankee\" drawers\nfor pants a whole winter.  I wore\nlow-cut shoes in winter, without socks.\nWhen a boy, I never had an undershirt\nnor dreamed of an overcoat.  I plowed, \nonce, three days for an old Greenleaf's\nArithmetic.  I only had split cedar for a \nlight three years.  Later, I walked eight\nmiles three times a week for three lessons\na week in physics and chemistry\nand paid a learned professor fifty cents\nfor each lesson.  God forbid that any\nboy, white or black, should ever be\nforced to battle against such odds!  We\nmust give our youth more encouragement,\nmore substantial aid in their \n\nseeks not only to consign the youth in\nschool, but the entire race to a life of\ndrudgery work in the industrial school\nis becoming dangerous.  The youth who \nis learning a trade needs time for actual\nstudy and reflection on the principles of\nthat trade, as he does for his lessons in\nliterary branches.  But he is usually\nrushed for time for study in the ordinary\nbranches, then rushed for time to \n\nstudy his trade;  or under the popular\nidea of the \"practical\" he is forced into\nthe merest drudgery for means of support\nin school.  He has no time for\nsolid, substantial thought along either\nindustrial or literary lines.  Is it, then, \na matter of surprise that so many do\nnot succeed?  Yea, it is amazing that so\nmany do succeed so well.\nI want the boy or girl studying carpentry,\nshoemaking, sewing, agriculture\nto have the same time for reflection as\nthe boy or girl who studies law, medicine,\ntheology, pedagogy.  Only in this\nway can we elevate the cook-pot, the\nneedle, the saw, the spade, the plow and\nthereby ennoble and dignify labor.  Why\nnot my cook have as much general\nknowledge as my doctor?  She is just\nas necessary to my physical, yea, my \nmental salvation.  Give the youth a better\nchance.  Let every trade and profession\nbe full of pure culture.  Millions\nof dollars must be put into brains for\nnothing else but for the sake of brains,\nregardless of utility.\nW. H.

JONES.\n\nAbout eight months ago the famous\nTwenty-fifth Infantry, colored, rolled\ninto Chattanooga amid the shouts of\nthousands of men, women and children,\nboth white and colored, who had gathered\nat the union depot to get a look at\nthose brave warriors who had for years\nheld at bay the red men of the West and\nkept the Stars and Stripes floating in\nthe \"land of the setting sun.\" The black\ntroops were then on their way to a foreign\nclime to shake the United States \nflag in the face of the most warlike nation \namong civilized people.\nIn the latter part of June they landed\non Cuban soil under the protection of\nthe fire of the American navy, and from\nthat time until they stormed the heights\nof El Caney the eyes of the nation were\nupon them.\nRegiment after regiment of the bravest\nmen of America (white) retired,\nshattered and torn to pieces under the\nSpanish fire, till the Seventy-first New\nYork, the sons of the blue bloods of\nthe Empire State, wheeled into line and\nfound themselves facing the deadly cannon\nin the blockhouses and the trenches \n\nI have not see a drunken Negro soldier\nsince last spring.

The people who\nwere \"hit hard\" by this change were\nthe wealthier citizens of Detroit, who\ninvariably invested in the vacant land of\nthe city and held it to the great disadvantage\nof the laboring people who were \nlooking to purchase homes.\nThe taxes were equalized between the\nrich speculator and the poor home\nowner.  The speculators have ever since\nbeen arch enemies of Mr. Pingree, but\nthe poor home owners \"caught on\" and\nthey are his friends.  The fight in Detroit\nwas perhaps the most sanguine \n     ever fought.  Mayor Pingree\ncontinued his reform work in every \ndepartment of the city and as his guns\nwere invariably trained upon some\ngrasping corporation or upon some dishonest\ncity officials who were waxing\nfat off corporation \"pork,\" it was not\nlong before the combined money interests\nof the city were endeavoring to encompass\nhis defeat.  He was boycotted\nby the banks;  the newspapers for a\ntime refused to publish the name of\nPingree, the clergy were intimidated \ninto silence or denunciation and the\nfederal office holders were his out-spoken \nenemies, but he went to New York \nfor money to carry on his business, published\ndaily bulletins in front of the city\nhall in lieu of a newspaper and was\nelected to the office of mayor four successive\ntimes by greatly increased majorities\nin spite of purses of a hundred\nthousand dollars raised to elect his apponents,\nand Republican money it\nwas, though he was always the Republican\ncandidate. \nThis bitter contest was, in 1896, removed \nfrom the metropolis of Michigan\nto the state at large.  The masses of\nvoters in the Republican party had\nbeen watching the course of events\ndown in Detroit.  Mayor Pingree had\nby this time gained a national reputation\nand the voters throughout the state \nhad come to love the one man they\ncould depend upon to fight their battles.\nAt the state convention held in Grand \nRapids in that year the Pingree forces\nhad returned enough delegates from the\nstate to overcome all opposition and\nnominate their man for governor, but\nleft control of the state organization in\nthe hands of the federal push.  The campaign\nthat followed was a peculiar one.\nword had been passed \"down the line\" \nfrom Washington to \"knife the governor.\"\nAll the speakers employed by the\nstate central committee avoided making\nany mention of the candidate for governor,\nalthough Pingree was a large contributor\nto the funds.  It was estimated\nthat form thirty to forty thousand Republicans\nwould vote against their candidate\nfor governor, and even on election\nnight the first dispatch sent out by\nthe state committee was that \"McKinley\nwould pull Pingree through.\"  When\nthe votes were counted, however, it was\nseen that Pingree pulled McKinley\nthrough by about 35,000 votes.  After\nhis election Governor Pingree at once\nset about to apply his tax reform ideas\nto the state at large and here he met\nperhaps stronger and more determined\nopposition than he did in the city..  Two\nvery interesting sessions of the legislature\nwere held, the regular session in\n'97 and the extra session in '98, at both\nof which attempts were made to tax\ncorporation property held by individuals.\nThis seems to have especially \naroused the Washington end of Michigan,\nfor the President and Senators \nfrom Michigan rewarded members of\nthe Michigan legislature with federal\npositions for voting against and defeating \nthis necessary reform legislation,\nwhich all concede would be just to all\nconcerned.\nThis they succeeded in doing and\nwould, perhaps, have been willing to let\nit go at that and make friends with the \n\nFRANCIS HERBERT WARREN.\n\nport their candidate to a man and that\nat least fifty thousand Republicans\nwould vote for Whiting notwithstanding \nhe had advocated a Belamy form of\ngovernment on the stump.  One peculiarity\nabout Governor Pingree's campaigns\nis that he is always beaten most\nbadly just before election, but when the\nvotes are counted he is always re-elected\nby increased majorities, and in this instance,\nafter the polling of an extra\nlight vote, owing to the bad weather,\nhe was re-elected by 80,000 majority.\nMcKinley's plurality in '96 was about\n50,000 after a most exhaustive campaign\nand on a full vote.  Governor Pingree\nstands today the one positive force in\nMichigan politics.  The whole people\nhave demanded, by petition, that his reform\nideas be enacted into law, ad are\ngiving him unstinted support to this\nend, while, of course, the corporations,\ntheir friends and coagitors, are offering\nwhat opposition they have at their command,\nbut it is weakening every day.\nGovernor Pingree has set about since\nhis re-election marshaling his forces for\nthe final contest in the coming session\nof the legislature next month.  It now\nlooks as though he would accomplish\nat this session all he has set out to do \nThe electors have returned Pingree\nmembers in sufficient numbers to, seemingly,\nmake his success reasonably certain.\nSo weakened are the federal forces by\nthe governor's recent big success at the\npolls that if they succeed in landing\nBurrows in the Senate again it will be\nby votes that are bought and paid for\nin cash.\nThe question is often asked by those\nof his enemies who have not kept posted\nsince he was first elected mayor of Detroit,\nwhat has he done for the people?\nSingle taxers do not as a rule credit the\ngovernor with being a single tax man\nby taking his annual message for eight\nyears together with the reforms he has\naccomplished, I have pronounced him\na good enough single tax man to meet\ntheir support.\nIn his first annual message to the\ncommon council of the city of Detroit\ngiven in 1890, he says among other\nthings: \"Persons who hold large tracts\nof unimproved property within the city\nlimits should not be permitted to grow\nrich through the enterprise of their\nneighbors without contributing their\njust share of taxes.  Such property\nshould be taxed according to its full\ncash value, the same as improved property,\nas the law plainly directs.\"\nAgain in 1892 he calls the attention\nof the alderman to the thirty millions\nof dollars of railroad property within\nthe city limits that is exempt from taxation\nfor no valid reason on earth, and\nsays:  \"Whenever an individual pays a\ndollar of municipal tax he contributes \ntwenty-five cents to the coffers of these\nprivileged corporations.\"\nIn his message to the council in 1893 \nhe says: \"Railroad companies exert so\nmuch influence upon legislation that it\nseems almost impossible to procure the\npassage of an act compelling them to\npay their just proportion of the burden\nof taxation.  Still this scandalous\nand notorious fact should not prevent\nus from making every possible effort to\ncompel these companies to pay local\ntaxes.\"\nIn another page in the same message,\nhe says: \"It seems to me that as long\nas the general tax law of the state requires\nall forms of wealth, whether consisting\nof real or personal property, to\nbe equally assessed, high-priced paintings,\nstatuary and furniture should be\nassessed at somewhere near their approximate\nvalue.  I understand that\nthis has never been done here.  There \nare houses in Detroit which contain\nfully $150,000 worth of property of this\nkind which is not assessed at more than\n$5,000.  *  *  *  There is no reason \n\nommendations could not be questioned.\nThe railroads of the state had hitherto\nbeen let off with light specific taxes\nwhile individuals were fully taxed according\nto the value of their property,\nespecially the poorer ones.  Governor\nPingree, ably seconded by Senator Robinson\nand Representative Atkinson,now\ndeceased, in their respective houses,\nmade an herculean effort to equalize the\ntaxes of these companies together with \ntelegraph and express companies, but\nwere thwarted in their efforts as above \nstated by the Washington wing of Michigan's\nRepublicans.  The work alone,\nhowever, in the thirty-ninth or last legislature,\nis not lost.  It awakened the\nvoter to a realizing sense of his duty\nto return as members of the state assembly,\nmen who will serve their interests\ninstead of serving the interests\nof these corporations, and the result is\nthat the assembly to meet this winter\nis mostly made up of men who will embody\nwithin the statues of the state all\nof the reforms mentioned and perhaps\nmore.  The bill offered by Senator\nRobinson for two sessions bids fair to\nalso become law.  It provides for 2-cent\nfares for the lower peninsular and 3 \ncents for the upper peninsular.  The\nrate now is 3 for the lower and 4 for\nthe upper, respectively.  Mention should\nhere be made of the Hon. Joseph Dickerson,\nof Detroit, a colored member of\nthe last session of the legislature.  So \nhonest and conscientious was he in the\nservice of the people that he was recomended\nfor renomination by the Pingree\npeople and was renominated and\nelected, running far ahead of his ticket\nin his district.  Mr. Dickerson made\nseveral speeches in behalf of honest taxation\nduring the sessions of '97 and '98. \nWith Governor Pingree in the chair \nand a reform legislature the people of\nMichigan may well feel proud and secure,\nknowing that their long suffering\nis now to be relieved.  Not so, however,\nwith the people of the nation.  They are\nnow pretty much carried away with the\nsuccess of war but will soon again\nbe brought to a realyzing sense of the\ninjustice of national taxation.  In my\narticle on \"Site Value Taxation,\" appearing\nin the Christmas number of the\nFreeman for 1895, I endeavored to explain\nto the readers the injustice of\npresent tax laws.  What is true of Detroit\nand Michigan is largely true of the\nnation.  The remedies that apply here\nwill apply to the nation.  Would it not\nthen be wise to elect a Pingree for president.\nNo doubt that if the nomination\nwere to be made next week Mr. McKinley\nwould undoubtedly be renominated,\nbut would it not be wise two years\nhence to nominate a man with ability\nto reform the tax laws?\nMcKinley tariffs are a failure and this\nis attested to by no less a personage \nthan Senator Hanna who was quoted\nin Cleveland the other day as saying\n\"that it would be necessary to tax tea\nand coffee to produce sufficient revenue\nfor government purposes.\"  Governor\nPingree does not believe in taxing the\npoor women's tea and coffee.  He does\nbelieve in compelling the tax dodgers to\npay their just share of taxes, and so doe\nex-President Harrison believe in compelling\nthe rich bond holder to pay a\njust proportion.  When this is done\nthere will be no need for a tax on tea\nand coffee; indeed, if the rich were compelled\nto pay taxes in proportion to\ntheir holdings and in proportion to\nwhat the poorer people now pay the\ngovernment would not know what to\ndo with the money.  But you always\nhear a rich man like Mr. Hanna devise \nsome way to raise money but the right\nway.  They are forever heaping more\nburdens upon the poor than they can\ncarry and it is high time the people pay\nmore attention to who they return to\noffice.  They should choose men in\ntheir conventions who will serve their\ninterests instead of serving the interests\nof corporate wealth.  Yea, you shoul\ncommence at the precinct caucus and\nsend delegates to the conventions who\nyou can depend upon to make no mistake.\nThe Republican party in Michigan\nis now thoroughly Pingreeized. Let\nthe black men of the Sough and elsewhere\nhelp to reform the party everywhere\nto the end that we may obtain \nour just rights and equal oportunity to\nearn and retain our share of the good \nthings in life without having to pay our\nrich neighbor's taxes.

They should be given our undivided attention in this presidential campaign and unlist our hearty support.\n\nFor instance, we shold inform ourselves about the agricultural situation; try to understand the farmers' worries and woes and find out why they are lying awake nights bemoaning their unhappy fate. Of course, we should study the tariff, and know why the Republican party believes in protection [the tariff].  This is a question which concerns everyone in the United States - black as well as white - and we should spend a few moments trying to learn what the Reconstruction Finance Corporation has done; why President Hoover appointed it; and how it has worked.  I like to talk about it because what I don't know about it would fill several large books, but I, like other people, like to discuss things that I don't know anything about.  I do know this much however, that if that Reconstruction Finance Corporation had not functioned successfully, a great many people would not be able to write checks on banks today and feel sure that those checks would be honored, and some banks would have failed.  To be sure, a great many have kept their doors open because of the help received from this Reconstruction Finance Corporation which President Hoover named.\n\nThere is the bonus, and a whole lot of other questions which we should understand.  But I insist that when the group which is represented here to day looks over the Presidential Candidates, there is a very important and vital question which should be considered and discussed.  Some people claim that the race question should be entirely eliminated from the presidential campaign and that colored people should forget all about their race when they pick a presidential candidate.  If the conditions under which the colored people live in the United States were exactly like those confronting the majority of other citizens, I suppose that we should forget all about our race and consider nothing but the qualifications of the presidential candidate and the issues involved.  But that is not the case and you have to face facts as you find them in this old world and not as you like to have changed.  Every colored man and woman in this country should work with might and mane to keep the Republican party in control of National affairs, for no group of citizens will lose more if the Republicans lose and no group will gain. Every right which the colored people of this country enjoy has been bestowed upon them by the Republican Party. The constitutional amendments which abolished slavery and conferred the elective-franchise upon ex-slaves were written and passed by the Republican party.  On the other hand every law which takes from colored people the rights to which they are entitled as citizens has been enacted by the Democratic party.  Every measure designed to debar them from privileges which other citizens enjoy has been passed by the Democratic party.  From the moment the Dem. party was organized until the present day its attitude toward colored people has been hostile [a history of] in-season and out.  Every law which has been enacted to impede their progress, wound their feelings, crush their sensibilities, and distroy the manhood and womanhood of the race has been passed by the Dem. party.\n\n\nAnd here is something which colored women should think about when they go to cast their ballots on November 8th.  In every state controlled exclusively by the Dem. party, Jim-crow laws have been enacted and ridgely enforced.  As a result of these laws, colored women have been the victims of horrors which no pen can portray and no tongue can tell.  While riding in these Jim-crow cars into which colored women are forced, in every state of the section controlled by the Dem. party, colored women and colored girls have been subjected to indignities, which if described in detail would not only startle a large portion of the United States, but would shock the civilized world.  How could any sane colored woman in the United States vote for the Democratic party, which has forced her sisters to endure so many inconveniences and disconforts, plus mential and physical suffering as the Jim-crow laws.  I have no time to refer to the hidious Convict-Lease system which wrecks the bodies and distroys the lives of hundreds of colored men, women and children every year.  Nor have I the time to mention the dis-franchisement of colored people in these states controlled by the Democratic party.  You know as well as I do that there are thousands of colored people in the southern states who are intelligent and well-to-do who would take their lives in their hands if they dared to cast a ballot; while there are thousands of ignorant, lawless, ne'er-do-well whites who are encouraged, yes, forced to vote.  Where man has the chance to select those who are managing his personal affairs he generally selects those who have promoted his welfare and shuns those who have retarded his progress and injured[?]. \n\nUnder the circumstances with t he Democratic party well-known attitude toward colored people it is inconceivable that anyone through whose vains one single drop of African blood flows would vote to put the Democratic party in control of National affairs.  But let us forget the past and live in the present.  In the first place, the Republican party is no longer the party of Abraham Lincoln.  In the second place, the colored people have paid the debt of gratitude they owed long ago, and in the third place it is quite possible that the Democratic party may change, if one grants for the sake of argument that the Republican party has not done everything it might have done to promote the welfare of colored people, no one that tells the truth can deny that it has always been their friend and never their foe.\n\nOn the other hand, you may accuse the Republican party of as many sins of ommission or comission which you may choose but the fact remains that colored people are indebted to it for the only rights which they enjoy in the United States.\n\nEvery now and then colored people are urged to change their political affiliations from the Republican party to the Democratic party - just for the sake of change.  This reminds me of the very beautiful and classical [indecipherable] which runs something like this: \"Change just for the sake of change is like those old hotels which are always changing plates and feed their guest on the smells.\"  The Democratic party's attitude toward colored people is just the same today as it has always been and has not changed one single, solitary bit.  In several states where the Democratic party is in absolute power, colored people have been disbarred from the polls and have not been allowed to vote in the primaries.  Texas, where John Nance Garner lives, whom the Democrats are trying to make Vice-President of the United States, is one of those states.  Even after the United States Supreme Court rendered a decision that the colored man has a right to vote in the Democratic primaries, the representatives of the Dem. party declared they would find a way to circumvent the highest law of the land in the future as they did in the past.", "2", 39, 39, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-020:00192", "The effect of Charlotte Cordays \ndeath on France\n\nMarat was called the \nfriend of the people; was killed \nby a woman.

But in connection with such work\nlet us not neglect, let us not forget, the children, remembering\nthat when we love and protect the little ones, we\nfollow in the footsteps of Him, who when He wished to\npaint the most beautiful picture of Beulah land it is possible\nfor the human mind to conceive, pointed to the\nchildren and said - \"Of such is the kingdom of heaven.\"\n\nIt is frequently charged against the more favored\namong us who have been blessed with advantages of education\nand moral training superior to those enjoyed by\nthe majority, that they hold themselves too much aloof\nfrom the less fortunate of their people.

In no way could we live up to\nsuch a sentiment better than by coming into closer\ntouch with the masses of our women, by whom, whether\nwe will or not, the world will always judge the womanhood\nof the race. Even though we wish to shun\nthem, and hold ourselves entirely aloof from them, we\ncannot escape the consequences of their acts. So, that,\nif the call of duty were disregarded altogether, policy\nand self-preservation would demand that we go down\namong the lowly, the illiterate, and even the vicious to\nwhom we are bound by the ties of race and sex, and put\nforth every possible effort to uplift and reclaim them.\n\nIt is useless to talk about elevating the race if we do\nnot come into closer touch with the masses of our women,\nthrough whom we may correct many of the evils\nwhich militate so seriously against us, and inaugurate\nthe reforms without which, as a race, we cannot hope\nto succeed. It is often difficult, I know, to persuade\npeople who need help most to avail themselves of the\nassistance offered by those who wish to lift them to a\nhigher plane. If it were possible for us to send out a\nnational organizer, whose duty it would be to form\nclubs throughout the length and breadth of the land, it\nwould be no easy matter, I am sure, to persuade some\nof our women to join them, even though they knew\nthat by so doing they would receive just that kind of\ninstruction and counsel which they so greatly need. This\nfault is not peculiar to our women alone but is common\nto the whole human race. Difficult though it be for\nus to uplift some of our women, many of whose practices\nin their own homes and in the service of their employers\nrise like a great barrier to our progress, we should\nnevertheless work unceasingly to this end until we win\ntheir confidence so that they will accept our aid.\n\nThrough such clubs as I have just mentioned; the at-", "102", 37, 37, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00448", "350   CHURCH REVIEW.\n\nunions will close their doors in his face and make his\nstruggle for existence desperate indeed. So rough does\nthe way for her infant appear to many a poor colored\nmother, as she thinks of the hardships and humiliations\nto which he will be subjected, when he tries to earn his\ndaily bread, that instead of thrilling with joy and hope,\nshe trembles with apprehension and despair.\n\nThis picture, though forbidding to look upon, is not\noverdrawn, as those who have studied the labor question\nin its relation to our race can testify. What, then,\nshall we do? Shall we sit supinely by, with folded hands,\ndrooping heads, and weeping eyes, or shall we be up\nand doing, determined to smooth out the rough roads\nof labor over which tiny feet that now patter in play,\nwill soon stumble and fall? To our own youth, to our\nown tradesmen, we must preach efficiency, reliability,\nthorough preparation for any work in which they choose\nto engage. Let us also appeal directly to the large-\nhearted, broad-minded women of the dominant race, and\nlay our case clearly before them. In conversing with\nmany of them privately I have discovered that our\nside of the labor question has never been made a living,\nbreathing, terrible reality to them. In a vague way\nthey know that difficulties do confront colored men and\nwomen in their effort to secure employment, but they do\nnot know how almost insurmountable are the obstacles\nwhich lie in the path of the rank and file who want to\nearn an honest living. Let us ask these women both to\nfollow, themselves, and teach their children, the lofty\nprinciples of humanity, charity and justice which they\nprofess to observe. Let us ask that they train their\nchildren to be just and broad enough to judge men and\nwomen by their intrinsic merit, rather than by the adventitious\ncircumstances of race or color or creed. Let\nthe Association of colored women ask the white mothers\nof this country to teach their children that when they\ngrow to be men and women, if they deliberately prevent\ntheir fellow creatures from earning their daily bread,\nby closing the doors of trade against them the Father of\n\nTHE DUTY OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION.   351\n\nall men will hold them responsible for the crimes which\nare the result of their injustice, and for the human\nwrecks which the ruthless crushing of hope and ambition\nalways makes. In the name of our children, let us\nask, also, that they do all in their power to secure for our\nyouth opportunities of earning a living and of attaining\nunto the full stature of manhood and womanhood,\nwhich they desire for their own. In the name of justice\nand humanity, in the name of the innocence and helplessness\nof childhood, black childhood, as well as white\nchildhood, let us appeal to the white mothers of this\ncountry to do all in their power to make the future of\nour boys and girls as bright and promising as should be\nthat of every child, born on this free American soil. It\nis the women of the country who mould public opinion,\nand when they say that trades and avocations shall not\nbe closed against men and women on account of race or\ncolor, then the day of proscription and prejudice will\ndarken to dawn no more.\n\nAs individuals, we have presented our case again and\nagain.

One of the most interesting sights at the recent \ncelebration was the old broken down wagon which was the first to go on \nits rounds of education, demonstration and inspiration to the farmers \nof that section.\nAll the sessions of the recent celebration held the attention of \nthe audiences closely but none captivated them more than that one in \nwhich they were shown by experts how the people of the rural sections \nare taught to do certain kinds of work. It was an atmosphere of \"make \nbelieve\" in which they lived for the time being. For instance, the man \nwho came to teach us how to plant sweet potatoes started out by asking \n\"How many of you are going to plant sweet potatoes this spring? Those \nof you who are going to do so, raise your hands.\" And we all entered into \nthe spirit of the occasion and raised our hands. Forthwith the instructor \ntold us exactly how to plant them- what kind of soil should \nbe used - how to keep them warm enough, how deep to plant them, and so \non. \nThen there was a visiting nurse who gave a thorough lesson on how \nto care for the sick. On the platform before our very eyes there was a \nsure enough bed in which a student who played the part of the patient \nwas lying. The nurse showed how to change both the sheets without disturbing \nthe patient, explaining just how it was done as she deftly did \nthe job. Valuable information was also given about the steps to be taken \nto restore the patient to health and prevent the spread of disease.\nNext to the visiting nurse was the young woman who taught the audience \nhow to \"tie and dye.\" She held in her hand a piece of white material \nwhich looked like silk. There were several pans. One of them contained \ngreen dye and the other yellow. The dyer plunged the whole piece \nof material into the yellow dye and wrung it out. After [As] she shook it out, \n\n6\nshe rolled the center into a tight wad and dipped the loose ends into \nthe green dye. She shook that out also and sure enough the material had \nbeen metamorphosed into a pretty green and yellow [colored] scarf. But the ends did not \nexactly suit the young woman, so she dipped the green ends again into \na dark blue dye and intensified the green which greatly improved the \ncolor scheme. Then followed alluring and encouraging suggestions about \nthe wonders which could be accomplished in the home and for one's wardrobe, \nif one only knew how to dye. Old faded dresses could be made to \nlook like new, to say nothing of faded draperies and spreads. \nNext to the \"tie and dye\" lady was one who sounded the praises of \nthe fireless cooker and showed exactly how to make one. Nothing was \nmore simple than the process used to convert an ordinary galvanized \npail with some excelsior plus several other little accessories into a \ncooker which the audience was told would greatly reduce the housewife's \nlabor and improve the quality of the food as well.\nThen came the man who urged the farmer to spray potatoe plants \nso as to destroy the bugs which devour them. And there were sure enough \npotatoe bugs crawling on the leaves of the plants as lively as crickets \ntill the deadly spray was applied to them when they soon ceased to do \ntheir evil deeds.

Then\nDispensations follow, alternating with Interregnums.\nThe subjects discussed are some of the most important \nin Biblical history and at the same time some of the\nknottiest in sacred literature. I call them knotty because\nsome of them have given rise to almost interminable\ndebates from the earliest period of our history to\nthe present moment. But the Master's hand is shown\nin dealing with them. These are some of the themes:\n\"The Significance of a Dispensation;\" \"Chronology of the\nBible;\" \"The Origin of Man;\" \"Descent of the Negro:\"\n\"Ordination of Women;\" \"The Flood;\" \"Division of the\nLand;\" \"Prophecy and Prophets;\" \"Baptism.\" Following\nthese divisions are: \"The Noachic, the Abrahamic,\nMosaic and Christian Dispensations.\" The Sixth Dispensation\nis the \"Dispensation of Glory.\"\n\nTo appreciate this work, to appreciate its merit and\nthe amount of learning and of research it displays, one\nmust possess it; he must read it and study it for himself.\nScience and theology go hand in hand and Bishop Tanner\nshows quite conclusively that there is no exception \nhere. Why should there be? In regard to the chronology\nof the Bible the following lines appear: \"Is there\nsuch a chronology?\" he asks. \"That altogether depends\nupon the definition given, and the phase of it determined\nupon. Undoubtedly Moses gives us the rule by means\nof which all true chronology must stand; and not so\nmuch a rule as a statement that is both a discovery and\na revelation. \"And God said, let there be lights in the\nfirmament of the heaven to divide the day from the\nnight and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for\ndays and years.\" Gen. i: 14. Herein man is pointed to\nthe only sure foundation of all chronology; for without\nthe help of the sun, moon and stars chronology would\nbe impossible. If, however, is meant what we might\ncall applied chronology after the fashion of those who\nspeak of applied chemistry, then for reasons both special\nand general we can agree with those - and among them\nDean Milman - who declare that there is no such thing\nas Biblical chronology.\n\nDISPENSATION IN THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH.   363\n\nOn the origin of man the writer is quite as clear,\nquite as forcible, and his arguments are both able and\nconvincing, especially to him who is seeking light. He\nsays, \"The doctrine of the direct creation of man - what\nwitnesses have we to substantiate them?\" Our witnesses\nare Moses, Job, Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah and Zechariah.\nMoses' first testimony is as follows: And God said\n\"Let us make man in our image, after our likeness.\"\n\n\"Upon this, the first testimony of Moses, it is to be said that there\nis little of the definiteness we desire. And yet, as it relates to the\nquestion at issue, while we could wish, for the sake of discussion,\ngreater details were given, the fact stated is not to be overlooked,\nthat man was made directly by God. And first, it is noticeable that\nhis making is alluded to in a way peculiar to itself. Of the creation\nof light, God said, 'Let there be light.' Of the creation of the firmament,\nHe said, 'Let there be a firmament.' Of the seas and the\nearth, 'Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into\none place and let the dry land appear.' Of the great vegetable world,\n'Let the earth put forth grass.' Of the heavenly world, 'Let there\nbe lights in the firmament of heaven.' Of all marine creatures,\n'Let the waters bring forth abundantly.' Of all terrene animals, 'Let\nthe earth bring forth living creature of its kind.' It was simply: Let\nthe things be done. But when He came to the making of man, an\nentirely different form of speech was employed. It is no longer, Let\nthe thing be done - done by long process of development, if you\nplease, but the set phrase is pushed aside and an entirely new one\nemployed: 'Let us make man.' Why this difference? Manifestly\nfor one or two reasons. Either to settle upon the wisdom of such\ncreation itself, or the use of a different method. That it could not\nhave been the first is certain, and for the reason that the general\ncreation had already advanced too far.\"\n\nI have thus given this long extract because it so\nbeautifully illustrates the rhetorical finish and the logic\nof the argument employed by the writer. Again\n\n\"But let us listen to Moses' third statement upon the origin of\nman; for, if we are not mistaken, it throws such a flood of light upon\nthe matter, in that it gives us details, as ought, we think to settle the\nquestion at once. Having previously said that God made (assah)\nman, that he created (bara) him, as though unwilling to leave a\nshadow of ignorance as to the how, he graciously says - Gen ii: 6.,\n'and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground.' The\nverb here employed is neither assah nor bara, but yalsar, which\nsignifies to form, to fashion, to make. Are we asked to account for", "110", 37, 37, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00455", "364   CHURCH REVIEW.\n\nthe employment of these three distinct verbs? And all, in the space\nof what is, to us, this thirteen verses? With but a single exception\nonly one verb is employed in the recital of all other forms of life,\nwhether of the air, the land or the sea.  Twice the number of verses\nand one verb; one half the number of verses and three verbs. Such\na fact as this utterly destroys the argument that Moses uses these\nverbs synonymously.\"\n\nHow strongly and forcibly put are these arguments.\nThe whole book is just so lucid and just so clear in\nstatement. I have seldom read a treatise dealing with\nsuch themes that was so fascinating in style from the\nfirst page to the last.\n\nThe fourth prelude discusses a subject that every Negro\nschool teacher, every Negro clergyman, every Negro\nscholar ought to read and to study. I call especial\nattention to it.\n\nA startling proposition has been made by those not\nin sympathy with the race and by skeptical scientists\nand theologians that the Negro is not descended from\nHam. In fact, that he is the result of a separate and\ndistinct creation - if created at all - that he is a Preadamite.\nMany theologians and scientists and men of\nsmaller pretensions are seeking data to prove a theory\nthat may accord with their notions. Bishop Tanner\ndiscusses this subject thoughtfully, thoroughly and ably\nand carries his point, as I think.\n\nAfter referring to the statement of Revs. Drs. J. H.\nVincent, J. M. Freeman and J. L. Hulburt: \"It is not\ncertain whether or not the Negro race descended from\nHam,' (Sunday School Journal M. E. Church, Lesson\nIV. Jan. 23), the Bishop plunges into his subject and\nshows that the theory is born of prejudice and not of\nfact, that it is not Scriptural. Says the author:\n\n\"That the Negro is of African patrimony the world knows. The\ndullest blockhead of the most out-of-the-way country school knows\nthat the father of the black fellow whom he is all the time meeting\ncame from Africa. Nor could the most persistent pedagogue get him\nto believe otherwise. The Negro, then, is of Africa. But who settled\nAfrica - which of the sons of Noah, we mean? The one authoritative\nvoice in the settlement of this question is the Bible, for it alone,\nas we have said, throws light upon ages declared to be prehistoric by\n\nDISPENSATIONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE CHURCH.   365\n\nthe secular analysts  Is Europe Japhetic? Is Asia Shemitic? Then\nAfrica is Hamitic by one and the same testimony; re-inforced however,\nwe may be allowed to say, by the facts of philology; for while\nEurope and Asia depend altogether on the statements of history,\nAfrica can call to her help philology. Why should Holy Writ be\nthought to speak infallibly of two and fallibly of one? Were the\nwriters biased or were the facts more difficult to remember? Neither\nsupposition is to be entertained.\"\n\nAgain, in another place, he says:\n\n\"To attempt to assign the Negro another than Hamitic origin is\nnothing less than an attempt to read the Bible with other than the\nold time Christian eyes. In the light of those eyes the Bible is an\ninspired book; if not verbally inspired, certainly plenarily inspired.\nAccording to this light the race was a unit, with Noah for its head as\none, and Shem, Ham and Japhet as its heads in parts. But in the\nlight of these new eyes, all this is seen to be erroneous.\"\n\nThus does the author meet his antagonistic step by\nstep with invincible argument. That language was once\nhomogeneous, that it was once a unit and that it sprang\nfrom a common source seems settled beyond dispute. If\nwe then accept this as a fact we must conclude that the\nrace was once a unit, that all races sprang from one and\nthat in the diversity of peoples and races language likewise\nbecame diversified. This may add a thought to\nBishop Tanner's argument in support of one center of\ncreation - though he is abundantly able to maintain his\nown ground without any assistance from me.\n\nAs to the universality of the flood, the author gives\nreason for his faith in the summary of his arguments,\nthus: God's mightiness is equal to the emergency. Secondly,\nsupposing the flood to have been universal, the\nfact could not be communicated to the world if the\nrecord already given does not tell of us that fact. Third,\nall the ages that have since passed, understood the patriarchs,\ninspired and uninspired, to say that the flood was\nuniversal. Fourth, nothing is gained by denying it,\nbut on the contrary, much is lost in that it makes the\nteachings of the Bible uncertain.\n\nSignificant is that chapter on Baptism, and we can\nonly call attention to it.

There is fundamental truth and there is\nscholastic truth. Christianity is the former, denominations the latter.\nChristianity is the life-giving root; denominations are the green\nbranches growing out of that life. What the heathen needs is the\nfundamental truth, the root, planted in his heart, so that, whether\nplanted by Arminian Paul, or watered by Calvinistic Apollos, the increase\nwill be from God.\n\nThe heathen has nothing to do with denominational tenets; he\ncannot understand them. The war and strife of them appeal to his\nsavage mind more strongly than the peace which passeth all understanding;\nand thus his new religion becomes to him what his heathenism\nor Mohammedanism was, a system of rites and ceremonies to\nfight for and hate dissenters for but wholly without the heart-changing\nand life-ordering power which comes from a spiritually discerned\nreligion.\n\nThat there is Divine purpose in these contentions of sects and\ncreeds no one can deny.

The same God who ordained divisions and thought-friction\namong men ordained the times and theatres for their activity. \"There\nis a time,\" \"When the fullness of time was come,\" etc. etc. must\nnot be left out of the plan.

Suppose when they are subdued, we begin\nour training in the art of government by wild solicitations to support\nthe candidates of either the Republican, Democratic, or Populist\nparty, would they not soon be at each other's throats and be no\nbetter Americans for it all than before liberty was brought to them! \nThis is what is happening by the struggle of denominations to win\nadherents to themselves in the name of Christianity among those who\nhave never heard of Christ. Is it well? All would be changed if\nwe should recognize the religious 'sphere of influence\" by respecting\nthe previous occupancy of a sister denomination and seeking, instead,\nan unoccupied field.\n\nSuch a concession would remove the provocation of self-defense\nwhich is at the root of most doctrinal polemics, and turn the full\nforce of undivided energy upon the problem of heathen Christianization.\n\nEDITORIALS.   387\n\nNo visible movement looking to this consummation exists just now,\nso far as I know, but that the tendency is toward fraternity and cooperation,\nno one observing the signs of the times can doubt.

But the honoring of manhood,\naside and apart from the accident of position, is a growing fact\nwhose world-width the twentieth century will reveal more fully than\nthe past. The Methodist Episcopal Church will give equal lay representation\nin its next General Conference. In electing Prof. I.\nGarland Penn assistant Epworth League Secretary it essentially followed\nour action in electing laymen to General positions.

In the midst of the night Washington awoke.\nHe looked about and descried the negro as he sat. He gazed at him a while\nand then spoke.\n'Primus!' said he calling; 'Primus.'\nPrimus started up and rubbed his eyes. 'What, General?' said he.\nWashington rose up in his bed. 'Primus' said he, 'what did you men by saying\nthat you had blankets and straw enough Here you have given up your\nblanket and straw to me, that I may sleep comfortably, while you are obligated\nto sit through the night.'\n        'Its nothing, General', said Primus. 'Its nothing. I'm well enough.\nDont trouble yourself about me, General, but go to sleep again. No Matter\nabout me.  I sleep very good.'\n'But it is matter- it is matter', said Washington, earnestly. ' I cannot\ndo it Primus. If either is to sit up, I will, But I think there is no need\nof either sitting up. The blanket is wide enough for tow. Come and lie\ndown here with me.'\n     ' Oh, no, General', said Primus, starting and protesting against the\npreposition. No, let me sit here. I'll do very well on the stool.'\n' I say, come and lie down here!' said Washington authoritatively. 'There \nis room for both and I insist upon it.'\n        He threw open the blanket, as he spoke, and moved to one side of\nthe straw. Primus professes to have been exceedingly shocked at the idea\nof lying under the same covering with the Commande-in Chief, but his tone \nwas so resolute and determined that he could not hesitate. He prepared himself,\ntherefore, and laid himself down by Washington, and on the same straw\nand under the same blanket the General and the Negro servant slept till \nmorning.\"\n        This same Primus Hall served throughout the Revolutionary War and\nwas among those who in the War of 1812 went to Castle Island in Boston Harbor\nto assist in building fortifications.

Of course, there is a reason for the historian's failure to give\nthe colored man the credit which he so richly deserves.  In the majority of\ncases colored men did not fight in organizations exclusively their own, as\nhad already been stated.  They were scattered throughout the army, two or\nthree in a company composed of whites, a squad in a regiment, a few companies\nwith an army, so that is was almost impossible to separate the record\nwhich they made as a racial group from that of their white comrades with\nwhom they fought side by side.\n      One  must undertake the gruelling job of reading painstakingly the\nhistory of villages and towns.

THE WESTERN WORLD.\nTHE AMERICAN CLUB WOMAN.\nWhat Colored Women Have Done.\nTHE FEDERATION'S ATTITUDE.\nBy Mary Church Terrell, President of the National Association\nof Colored Women.\nShould anyone ask what special phase\nof the negro's development makes me most\nhopeful of his ultimate triumph over present\nobstacles, I should answer unhesitatingly, \nit is the magnificent work the women\nare doing to regenerate and uplift the\nrace. Judge the future of colored women\nby the past since their emancipation, and\nneither they nor their friends have any\ncause for anxiety.\nFor years, either banding themselves \ninto small companies or struggling alone,\ncolored women have worked with might\nand main to improve the condition of their\npeople. The necessity of systematizing\ntheir efforts and working on a larger scale\nbecame apparent not many years ago and\nthey decided to unite their forces. Thus\nit happened that in the summer of 1896\nthe National Association of Colored Women\nwas formed by the union of two large\norganizations, each of which has done\nmuch to show our women the advantage\nof concerted action. So tenderly has this\ndaughter of the organized womanhood of\nthe race been nurtured and so wisely ministered\nunto, that it has grown to be a\nchild hale, hearty and strong, of which its\nfond mothers have every reason to be \nproud. Handicapped though its members\nhave been, because they lacked both money\nand experience, their efforts have, for the\nmost part, been crowned with success in\nthe twenty-six states where it has been\nrepresented. \nKindergartens have been established by\nsome of our organizations from which encouraging\nreports have come. A sanitarium\nwith a training school for nurses\nhas been set on such a firm foundation by\nthe Phyllis Wheatley club of New Orleans,\nLouisiana, and has proved itself to be such\na blessing to the entire community that\nthe municipal government has voted it an\nannual appropriation of several hundred\ndollars. By the Tuskegee, Alabama,\nbranch of the association the work of\nbringing the light of knowledge and the\ngospel of cleanliness to their poor benighted\nsisters on the plantations has been\nconducted with signal success. Their efforts \nhave thus far been confined to four\nestates, comprising thousands of acres of\nland, on which live hundreds of colored\npeople, yet in the darkness of ignorance\nand the grip of sin, miles away from\nchurches and schools.\nPlans for aiding the indigent, orphaned\nand aged have been projected and in some\ninstances have been carried into successful\nexecution. One club in Memphis, Tennessee,\nhas purchased a large tract of land,\non which they intend to erect an old\nfolk's home, part of the money for which\nhas already been raised. Splendid service\nhas been rendered by the Illinois Federation\nof Colored Women's Clubs, through\nwhose instrumentality schools have been\nvisited, truant children looked after, parents\nand teachers urged to co-operate with\neach other, rescue and reform work engaged\nin, so as to reclaim unfortunate\nwomen and tempted\ngirls, public institutions investigated,\ngarments cut, made\nand distributed to the needy\npoor.\nQuestions affecting our legal \nstatus as a race are sometimes\nagitated by our women. In\nTennessee and Louisiana colored\nwomen have several times \npetitioned the legislature of\ntheir respective states to repeal\nthe obnoxious Jim Crow\ncar laws. In every way possible\nwe are calling attention to\nthe barbarity of the convict\nlease system, of which negroes\nand especially the female prisoners\nare the principal victims,\nwith the hope that the conscience\nof the country may be\ntouched and this stain on its\nescutcheon be forever wiped\naway. Against the one room\ncabin we have inaugurated a\nvigorous crusade. When families\nof eight or ten men, women\nand children are all huddled\npromiscuously together in\na single apartment, a condition\ncommon among our poor\nall over the land, there is little\nhope of inculcating morality\nand modesty. And yet in\nspite of the fateful heritage\nof slavery, in spite of the manifold\npitfalls and peculiar temptations\nto which our girls are subjected, and\nthough the safeguards usually thrown around\nmaidenly youth and innocence are in some\nsections entirely withheld from colored\ngirls, statistics compiled by men not inclined\nto falsify in favor of my race show\nthat immorality among colored women is\nnot so great as among women in some foreign\ncountries who are equally ignorant,\npoor and oppressed.\nBelieving that it is only through the\nhome that a people can become really good\nand truly great the National Association \nhas entered that sacred domain. Homes,\nmore homes, better homes, purer homes\nis the text upon which sermons have\nbeen and will be preached. There has \nbeen a determined effort to have heart to\nheart talks with our women that we may\nstrike at the root of evils, many of which \nlie at the fireside. If the women of the\ndominant race, with all the centuries of\neducation, culture and refinement back of\nthem, with all the wealth of opportunity\never present with them, feel the need of\na mother's congress, that they may be enlightened\nupon the best methods of rearing\ntheir children and conducting their homes,\nhow much more do our women, from whom\nshackles have but yesterday been stricken,\nneed information on the same vital\nsubjects. And so the association is working\nvehemently to establish mother's congresses\non a small scale, wherever our\nwomen can be reached.\nFrom this brief and meager account of\nthe work which has been and is still being\naccomplished by colored women through\nthe medium of their clubs, it is easy to\nobserve how earnest and effective have\nbeen their efforts to elevate their race. No\npeople need ever despair whose women are\nfully aroused to the duties which rest upon\nthem and are willing to shoulder responsibilities \nwhich they alone can successfully \nassume. The scope of our endeavors\nis constantly widening. Into the various\nchannels of generosity and beneficence we\nare entering more and more every day.\nSome of our women are now urging their\nclubs to establish day nurseries, a charity\nof which there is an imperative need.\nThousands of our wage-earning mothers\nwith large families dependent almost entirely\nupon them for support are obliged to\nleave their children all day, entrusted to\nthe care of small brothers and sisters, or\nsome good-natured neighbor who promises\nmuch but who does little. Some of\nthese infants are locked alone in the room\nfrom the time the mother leaves in the \nmorning, until she returns at night. Not\nlong ago I read in a southern newspaper\nthat an infant thus locked along in a room\nall day, while its mother went out to\nwash, had cried itself to death.

They\nwho are deemed idealists, and who aim \nat divine and far-reaching effects. \nMissions to degraded races are the \nmost colossal piece of idealism in the \nworld. Prosperous selfishness has always \nsneered at them. It is one of the \nevil results of luxury, moral indifference, \nand increasing age that very \nmany people cease to be brave dreamers; \nthey have abandoned youthful visions, \nand no longer live in the future, \naspiring toward ideal goals. Oh, how    \nmany of the middle-aged in our cities \nhave lost themselves in losing their \nbrave and shining hopes, and their \nGod-kindled aspirations! Unconsciously \nthey have become degenerate, and \nare reverting toward lower types. The \ngreat exceptions are those who toil \nfor celestial ends, in whose eyes gleams \nthe splendid light of optimism. I find \nthat Christian ministers are usually \noptimists, however old or young they \nmay be. I speak today to a company \nof optimists, who, after all, are the \nmost efficient workers for the prosperity \nof the churches at home, for you \nwell know that is missions are neglected \nand pushed aside, the work of the \nhome church goes down like a column \nof mercury touched by the Northern \nblast. I find that professors in Christian \ncolleges are rational optimists if \nthey keep their hears close to the life \nof the young, and so are all toilers for \nmissions, And it is a historical fact \nthat these are the personalities who \nhave pushed forward the progress of \nthe race. \n\nWhat a different atmosphere the missionary \ncause now breathes from that \nof five years ago, and especially from \nthat of fifty or a hundred years ago!\nWe are getting into wider and clearer \nair. We stand on loftier summits, \nand look toward broader horizons. Not \nonly has our Republic been lifted into \na dazzling eminence in the politics of \nthe world, but all missions have taken \non a new aspect and are seen in their \ntrue relations as vital to the regeneration \nof mankind. What are called \n\"secular events,\" the founding of the \nEast Indian company, the British conquest \nof India, and the occupancy of \nEgypt; the war in the Soudan, the \nopening of the ports of Japan and \nChina, the battle of Manila, the expulsion \nof Spain from the East and \nWest Indies, the formation of the    \nCongo Free State, the building of Chinese \nrailroads, the annexation of Hawaii, \nthe perfecting of the steamship, \nthe invention of the telegraph, the laying \nof submarine cables, the series of\ninternational expositions, the establishment\nof international news agencies, the \nmoral federation of Anglo-Saxon peoples, \nthe authorized publication of Sanscrit \ntexts of the ancient Hindu Scriptures, \nand the growing unrest in comparative \ntheology, Lincoln's Proclamation \nof Emancipation, the purchase of \nAlaska, like the previous purchase of \nLouisiana, are all now seen to have \nvital relations to the expanding kingdom \nof God. For the line which separates \nsecular and sacred history is becoming \ninvisible like the line between \nhome and foreign missions. \n\nIs America sorry for any good which \nshe has wrought for the African, the \nIndian, and the Chinese, in our country? \nIs American regretful for what she \nhas already accomplished for good in \nthe Orient? Are we not happy in all\nthat we have done for the Japanese, \nwhom we once considered inferior?  \nTheir educational and political regeneration, \ntheir moral and commercial uprising, \ntheir present status among civilized\npowers, are due largely to the \nChristian leaven which America's hand \ncast into the life of the great archipelago. \nThe first address which I made \nin Japan was in a church in Kobe, and \nabove the pulpit were crossed two of the \nred and white banners of the Japanese \nempire. I felt a deep sympathy with\nJapanese patriotism, and joy that the\nsun of righteousness had shed new light \non the old flag. There is rich promise \nfor Asia's future in the spirit and progress \nof the \"despised dwarfs,\" as their\nChinese enemies stigmatize them. Their  \nflag has conquered ???\nglories of the Orient\" only thru that \nlight which has pierced the darkness \nand barbarism of so many of her Pacific \narchipelagoes. The church intends that \nthe Bible shall do its glorious work in \nthe hearts of these peoples from Porto \nRico to Luzon. That is what we are \nmet here for. Friends, let us help to \nbring the whole church into a new \npsychological state. There is moral\nenergy enough in Christendom now latent \nto evangelize our country and the \nwhole globe in the coming century, or \nto begin that evangelization in every \nvillage and city of the world. O how \nwe need a revival of systematic beneficence; \nit ought to be a part of the \ntwentieth century Gospel; it ought to\nbe so enjoined as almost to be a condition \nof church membership. The Alsatian \npastor, John Frederick Oberlin, \nwould not permit even his peasant boys \nand girls to come to the Holy Communion \nuntil they had furnished evidence \nof having planted two trees in their \nrock-strewn valley. It is for us to \nplant and nourish trees of ample verdure \nand more enduring beneficence, \nwhose leaves and fruit shall be \nfor the healing of the nations. \nWe need to perceive the unity \nof all the branches of church work, to \nsee and feel that home missions and \nforeign missions, that Christian education, \nthat our labors amid the forests \nof Porto Rico and the Indian huts       \nof Dakota and Alaska, are all parts of the \none great, divine missionary plan of our\nheavenly Leader. \n\nA mighty uplift is surely coming. Ages \nof Christian martyrdom have always \nbeen those of rapid spiritual progress. \nThe age of the martyrs, how strange it \nseems, is again upon us! I believe that \nthose American missionaries who have \nrecently given their lives in the Far \nEast will loom up in the history of \nAsia, and be covered with a moral splendor \nlike that which in this land belongs \nto the men and women of the Mayflower. \nIn some countries, as in Armenia \nand China, the church seems to have \nbeen carried back to the awful days of  \nNero and Diobcletian. At our Oberlin reunion \nlast June we received loyal and \nbeautiful greetings from our missionaries \nin Shansi. They said, \"From the \nrich plains of Shansi, green with springing \nwheat, from her mountains crowned \nwith crumbling heathen fanes, we greet \nyou. From our work among the slaves \nof opium, from our growing churches, \nfrom our schools where we strive to reproduce \nthe impressions our professors \nmade on us, our hearts go out to you. \nThe remembrance of Oberlin is very  \nprecious to her sons and daughters in \nfar-away Shansi.

These devoted \nChristian souls were soon to give \nin loathsome prisons or in cruel death \n\"the last full measure of devotion.\" If\nany among these are still alive, others, \nequally brave, have joined \"the noble \narmy of martyrs\" whose blood evermore \nMr. Beecher once said, \"There is no \nsuch seed planted in this world as good \nblood.\" Remember that, O church of \nChrist! and rejoice, O spirits of the martyrs \nthat went up to God from the rich \nplains of China, yellow with the ripening \nwheat.

[*[March 17, 1900]*]\n\nTHE WOMEN'S WORLD\n\nDear Euphemia Kirk,- In compliance \nwith the request preferred in your\nlast contribution to The Colored American,\nI send the following facts concerning\na woman of whom we all should \nbe proud.\nIn Augusta, Ga, there is a co-\neducational school for colored youth,\nfounded by Miss Lucy Laney, who has \ndevoted her entire life to the elevation\nof her race.  From her earliest youth\nshe seems to have nursed the desire to\nestablish a school, and she shaped her\nlife to this end.  At sixteen she graduated\nfrom Atlanta University  For \nseven or eight years after her graduation\nshe taught in the public schools of \ntwo or three cities in Georgia, accumulating \nexperience for the founding of\nher own school which she had by this\ntime decided to establish in Augusta.\nAfter teaching a while in the lecture\nroom of the colored Prebyterian church\nshe rented a two-story plank house for\na dormitory, and converted an old barn\non the premises into a school room to\nwhich she transferred her work.  She\nhired teachers to help her, through she\nhad no means of paying them, except\nas she could collect the meagre prices\nof tuition from the 'students, most of\nwhom were poor.  Her teachers complained\nwhen their salaries were not\nforthcoming and she found that she\nmust shoulder the great responsibility \nof the new school alone.  Miss Laney\ndid not receive a penny for her work,\nand spent all that she had previously\nearned in paying her teachers' salaries\nand trying to meet the various needs\nof the school.\nAfter struggling alone for three\nyears, Miss Laney went before the\nGeneral Assembly of the Presbyterian\nchurch which met in Minneapolis, and \nand so eloquently [?] [?] [?]\ncondition and needs of her race in the\nSouth, that the hearts of all who heard\nher were deeply touched.  The members \nof the Board were so impressed\nwith Miss Laney's courage, patience,\nunselfishness and good common sense\nthat they decided to assist her.  Her\nsuccess was phenomenal.  Having begun\nwith a mere handful of pupils Miss \nLaney reported 75 at the end of the first\nyear.  At the end of the second year the\nnumber had increased to 234.  The progress\nof her work was so satisfactory that\nwhen the board had the opportunity to\nplace ten thousand dollars in some\nparticular educational work in the South,\nthe members decided unanimously\nto give the money to Miss\nLaney's school . The Haines Normal\nand Industrial School now owns buildings\nworth between $15,000 and $20,000\nIt has about 500 students including\nboth boarders and day pupils.  The\nliterary work includes well arranged\ncourses of study from the kindergarten\nto the college preparatory.  The industries\ntaught are cooking, sewing, printing,\nmillinery, laundering and general \nhousework.  Miss Laney believe that\nspecial effort should bee made to save\nthe boys for whom she is trying to establish \na manual training school.  Miss \nLaney was so impressed with the\nearnest Christian character of Mrs. F.\nE Haines whom she met after her\nschool was established, that she named\nit the Haines Normal and Industrial\nSchool.  I am glad to say however, that\nan effort is being made to amend the\ncharter, so that the school founded by\nthis great and good woman may here-\nafter be known as the Lucey Laney Institute.\nHow I wish the National Association\nof Colored Women could establish\nat least one such school as Mrs.\nMilton H. Losee of Kansas City proposes\nto found.  Mrs. Losee intends to \nbuild a $200,000 college for house-\nkeepers and maids.  According to the \nplan outlined in the Chicago Inter\nOcean, the diploma awarded to a graduate \nof this college would assert that thee\nholder had passed a creditable examination\nin all the courses of instruction,\nincluding thee departments of laundering, \nscientific cooking of meats and \nvegetables, nursing and care of the \nsick, chamber work, dishwashing sweeping, \netc.  The building would accomodate\none hundred servant girls as resident \npupils.  It would have a complete banquet\nhall.  The pupils would live in \nthe building, and, aside from the course\nof study already outlined, they would\nreceive instruction in the proper care of\nthemselves, so as to make them from\nevery view point ideal servants.  Banquets\nwould be served and small parties\ndined.  The public could have fine\nwashing done in the institute, and the\nproducts of the school would be placed\non the market.\n\nIf there were only one such school\nfor colored girls, the benefit derived\ntherefrom would be incalculable.\nAt our Convention last summer I urged\nour women to establish schools of domestic\nscience, on a small scale, whenever\nit was possible to secure sufficient\nfunds.  One such school has recently\nbeen started, I am glad to say.  If we\ncannot supply skilled domestics to the \nemploying class, our doom is sealed,\n[?] fear.  It is growing more and\nmore difficult for colored women to secure\nemployment in the houses of the\nwell-to-do because they lack that training\nin domestic science which the intelligent\nhousekeepers of thee country \ndemand, and for which they are willing\nto pay.  I shall never ceae to urge\nthe National Association to take up this\nspecial work, until as an organization it\nhas established at least one school.  Will\nnot some of the wealthy members of\nthe race ponder this subject in their\nminds and treasure it in their hearts,\nso that they will be constrained to remember\nthe National Association in\ntheir wills and thus make it possible \nfor us to establish a school where colored\ngirls may be thoroughly trained\nan all the branches of household art?\n\nMrs. Lasee has sent out a circular\ncontaining twenty-one questions as to\nher plan, and the answers received by\nher have been uniformly favorable.\nSome of these questions it would be\nprofitable for the women who employ \nservants to ponder.  They are as follows:\n1. Do people want servants who have\nreceived diplomas?\n2. Would girls take advantage?\n3. Who would be benefitted?\n4. What does the mistress expect?\n5.  Girls to come from the poor, uneducated \nclass and immediately understand\ntaking care of finely finished\nand furnished homes, the value of fine\ncarpets, bric-a-brac and cut glass?\n6. Girls to sleep in cellars, stairways\nor attics?\n7. Girls to receive their company in\nthe kitchen?\n8. Girls to be intelligent and keep in\ntheir places?\n9. Girls to know without being taught?\n10. Girls to adopt their religious and\nmoral standards?\n11. Girls to be held up to ridicule before\nthe family and visitors without\nprotesting?\n12. Has a girl any rights?\n13. has she the right to demand the\nsame careful sanitary inspection of her\nquarters as the shop girl?\n14. Has she the right to demand and\nreceive wages without having to deposit\nmoney with a lawyer to bring suit \nfor her?\n15. Has she right to her own religious \nbelief without ridicule?\n16. Has she the right to demand respectful \ntreatment from the whole family?\n17.  Has she the right to ask the mistress\nfor her character?\n18.  Has she the right to be kept in\nrepair as a machine?\nOne of the results predicted from the\nestablishment of this college for Housemaids\nis the elevation of domestic labor\nto a standard which will remove the\ndistaste of young girls and women for\nhouse service.\n\nMrs. William Scott, the well known,\nlecturer and missionary was sent from\nPhiladelphia as a fraternal delegate to\nthe Convention of the National American\nWomen Suffrage Association by\nthe Universal peace Union.  Mrs. Scott\nwas authorized by this society to protest\nin its name against the disfranchisement\nof the Negro in the South.  She\ndid this so effectively that she made a\nprofound impression upon all who heard\nher.  Mrs. Scott is a very magnetic and \nforceful tpeaker, and I was glad the\nUniversal Peace Union sent her to plead\nfor themselves.\n\nMrs. Coralie Franklin Cook, who pre [?]\nthe greeting of the colored\nwomen to Susan B. Anthony on the \nlatter's eightieth birthday covered herself\nwith glory and made us all proud \nof her.  Such an exhibition of the intelligence,\nculture and eloquence of\ncolored women helps each and every\none of us, since it raises both the race\nand the sex in the estimation of the\ndominant race.\nWhat we want to do is to impress the\nwhite people fo the country with the\nfact that there are many colored women\nwho can measure arms successfully with\ntheir more fortunate sisters, whenever\nthey can get the chance.  Both Mrs. \nScott and Mrs. Cook proved this\nduring the convention of the Woman\nSuffrage Association recently held here\nbeyond the per adventure of a doubt.\nLet the good work go on.\nMARY CHURCH TERRLEL\n\nHoffman Music festival.\nThe Second Annual Musical Festival\nthat was inaugurated last year by\nMr. Elzie S.

SHEA,\nMarvelous Medium. \nGives the names of dead and living friends.\nTells who and when you will marry, also of\nbusiness, journeys, lawsuits, absent friends,\nhealth or anything you wish to know, no matter\nwhat it is.  He can call up your spirit\nfriends and show them to you.  Can make\nthem rap all around the room. He asks no questions,\ndon't ask you to write the names for\nhim.  Don't try to pump you in any way, but\ntells you right off.  He is thoroughly endorsed\nby leading Spiritualists everywhere;  received\nfrom them a gold medal and specia\nlicense to practice his wonderful powers; credentials\nno one e[l]se can show; can give thousands\nof references to both white and colored \npatrons.  Twenty five years practice seven\nin Brooklyn-w[i]ll show you that he can do all\nhe tells of.  Can tell you what business is best\nfor you and where.  Can tell you how to win\nspeedy marriage with one you love.  How to\nbe successful in all your doings, in short what\nis best to do.  he succeeds when all others \nfail.  Positive help and sati[s]factory or no pay\nCall and see  You will find it lucky to consult\nthis refined Christian gentleman.  he has\na medicine that will cure drunkenness; can\nbe given patients not knowing it.  Thousands\nthrough him are now\nRich, Happy and Successful \nin all their undertakings, while those who neglect\nhis advice are still laboring against pove[r]ty\nand adversity.  Through his perfect\nknowledge of chemistry he can impart to you\na secret that will overcome your enemies and\nwin you friends.  His aid and advice have often\nbeen solicited; the resul[t] has always been\nthe securing of speedy and happy marriage\nand all your wishes.  In love affairs he never\nf[a]ils.  He has the secret of winning the affections\nof the oppo[s]ite sex. \nIt is the curse of Spiritualism that in all\nlarge cities there are a c[l]ass of men and women\nwho claim powers they do not possess\n[T]hey have neither gifts, credentials, nor references.\nSurely the colored people are not so\nwanting in sense as to throw their time and\nmoney away on such.  DR. SHEA refers to the \nHon. Charles Miller, capitalist, 248[?] Atlantic \n[a]v[e]nue; the Hon. Wm. Denmore architect and\nbuilder, 47 Cleveland avenue, and Arthur \nS[?]well, ship builder, Sou[t]h Brooklyn.  All \nhave known him for the past seven years\nHe gives a free test of his power to all.  The\nDoctor has practiced five years in New Orleans,\nSt. Louis, Memphis and Louisville'\nunderstands thoroughly the diseases sp[e]lls o[f]\ninfluences the race is subject to.  He is now \nand always has been a true friend to the colored\npeople and always had a large patronage\nfrom them. \nPlease Read the Following\n\"BROOKLYN, June 3, 1892.--This is to certify\n[c]ame to New York form Albany, I was a stranger\nin a strange city out of work and out of\nmoney.

C.\n\nTHE WOMEN'S WORLD\n\nI didn't eavesdrop; I don't believe in\nit and I never do.  I use my ears however,\nand this is what I heard.  Both \nwere mothers and both were discussing\nthe subject most interesting to all good\nmothers-their children.  \"For the life\nof me, Mrs. Skuler, I don't see how you\ncould persuade yourself to send your\nbeautiful children to these public \nschools\" said Mrs. Arry Stocracy, \"I\nshould expect mine to be completely\nruined, if they came in daily contact\nwith those low children who go to our\nschools.  Many of them come from\nhomes which are perfect hotbeds of\nvice.  Their parents are vicious; many\nof them are criminals. What could you\nexpect of children from such homes?\nThe poor young ones are not to blame,\nbut the influence they exert upon your\nchildren is none the less pernicious on\nthat account.  I should feel that I was\nplanning my child's downfall, if I\nshould send him to the public school,\nwhere the foundation of so many unfortunate\nor evil careers is laid.\"  \"You\nreally shock me, Mrs. Stocracy\" said\nMrs. Skuler, \"for I have educated four\nchildren in the public schools of this\ncity, and it never occurred to me that\nI was preparing them for careers of\nvice. I consider myself a pretty good\njudge of school systems and school\nteachers, for I was educated in a public\nschool, have taught in a public school\nand I have visited the public schools in\nother cities, whenever I got a chance.\nFrom observation and comparison I \nhave concluded that one would have\nto travel quite a distance, before he\nwould find public schools better manned\nand better equipped that are those here\nin Washington.\"  \"Oh,\" interrupted\nMrs. Stocracy, \"I have no fault to find\nwith the curriculum here. I don't presume\nto pass judgment upon that point\nfor I have not studied that question \nenough to do so.  I was talking about\nthe effect which a course in the public\nschools here has upon the mental life\nof the child, but was calling attention\nto the effect it has upon his morals.\"\n\"You would have to keep your children\nalways tied to your apron strings\"\nreplied Mr. Skuler, \"if you wanted to\nshield them entirely from evil companions.\nIt might be desirable to do\nthis, but it is not possible, as the world\nis constructed.  Sooner or later the\nbest children must see the bad side of\nlife.  I think it is better to train a child\nproperly at home from his infancy.\nThen when he is ready to go to school,\nreason intelligently and patiently\nhim, and warn him against evil\ncompanions.  The sooner his education\nis shunning evil companions begins,\nthe better for the child.  No matter\nhow long you keep a child under his\nmother's wing at home, when he\nleaves the nest and begins to fly with\nother birds, he will inevitably make\nmistakes as to the kind of associates to\nchoose.  The mother must be watchful\nof course.   She must continually impress\nupon the child that he is in actual\ndanger when he is with an evil companion.\nThus his character is strengthened,\nwhile he learns the lessons of life\nwhich can not be repeated with too\nmuch emphasis or frequency. But why\nall this moralizing?  The proof of the\npudding is in the taste.  Look at our\ngreat men and our great women.  The\nvast majority were educated in the public\nschools.  While there are some un-\n\nworthy teachers in our corps here, just\nas there are everywhere else in the\nworld, you must admit that there are\nmany model men and women among\nthem.  Most of these were educated in\nthe public schools.  So far as my own\nchildren are concerned, Mrs. Stocracy,\nyou know what they are and what a \ncomfort they have been to me.  If\nchildren have it in them to be bad,\nrearing them in a moral hot-house,\nshielded from every form of evil will\nnot save them.  As soon as they are\nemancipated from the leading strings\nof their mistaken mothers, their joy in \nnew found freedom is liable to inspire\nin them a desire to taste forbidden\nfruit.  Besides, I think it is wrong to\ndeprive a child of the pleasure and the \ninspiration which keen competition\nwith other children of his own age always\nafford.\"  With that the conversation \ndrifted to the dreadful state of\naffairs in Kentucky and the public\nschool question was dropped.\n-\nMrs. L.

But it may be noted that\n the Italian position differs markedly \nfrom the Spanish, where a dictatorship\n was set up on the authority of the crown\n and operated largely under its direction. \nIn Italy the dictatorship resulted from \na national revolutionary protest against \nthe failure of democracy in a land \nwhose people lacked the temperament\nand long training to make this form of \ngovernment efficient, and the King \nappears to have had little to do with its \nestablishment and equally little with the \nresponsibilities of government since the \nDuce took charge.\n    Civilization is the art of living together\nin an ordered society. In the\nsteady progress of civilization from the\ntribal unit to an organization such as\nthe United States, the British Commonwealth\nor the League of Nations, monarchy\nhas had a vitally important part\nto play. It has been everywhere the instrument\nfor uniting independent\ngroups into organized nations, and administering\ninternal justice and external\ndefense, which permitted these nations\nto begin to develop their social life, their\narts and sciences, their commerce and\nindustry.\n           Public Demands Voice.\n     As society within a nation becomes\nmore firmly organized, the strength of\ncentral government naturally increases.\nBut with the growth of a prosperous\nand educated community, there will be\na larger tendency for the general body\nof the nation to watch with critical eye\nthe doings of its monarch and demand\na voice in his councils. Eventually it is\ninevitable that the personal autocracy\nof the sovereign should be limited in\nfact, if not in theory, by the will of the\npeople.\n     If a constitutional form is provided by\nwhich this will can be expressed, its\npressure can be peaceably exerted. if\nnot, it will express itself eventually by\nrevolution and the overthrow of the\nmonarch; possibly also of the throne.\nThe liberties won by two revolutions \nno constitute a firm foundation for\nthe British monarchy. Constitutional\nmonarchy is the form of government\nwhich has developed in this country and\namong its neighbors around the North\nSea. It is the system under which the \nnation is furnished with democratic\nmeans of letting the Sovereign know its\nwill and insuring that he and his ministers\ncarry it into effect.\n     Before the war German political \ntheorists, such as Troitschko, attacked\nthe theory of a constitutional monarchy \non the ground it demanded mediocrity\nin the [Sover?? ??? ???? ???]\ngent and tactful Sovereign. If the King\nhas less to do with the daily mechanics\nof political administration, there is a \ngreat scope for his energy and ability in\ninnumerable highly important directions\nclosely effecting the daily affairs and\nsocial well being of his people. A\nstupid, self-willed or vicious King would\nquickly imperil the safety of the throne.\n     Monarchs who have lost their seats \nsince the war were not those who ruled\nconstitutionally, and they were turned\naway not for being merely unnecessary\nbut for being definitely obstructive.\nFolly has lost the throne of Spain. Wisdom\npreserves that of Britain. The\nfunctions of a constitutional monarch\ncall not so much for high ability, as for\nsound instinct. Constitutional kingship\nis in itself an art. The Nordic Kings\nhave learned it to perfection. Hence\nthe complete absence of any republican\nmovement in their kingdoms. Socialists\naccord to the throne the same acceptance\nas die-hard Tories.\n             Military Movement.\n     Alfonso lost his throne because the\nSpanish people hold him responsible for\nthe abandonment of their constitutional\ngovernment and for the rule of the\ncountry since September, 1923, by Dictator\nGen. Primo de Rivera. Spain is\nnot perhaps the most progressive country\nin Europe. But it was too far developed\nin the spirit of modern civilization\nfor this autocracy to be permanently\nsuccessful. It was an autocracy\ndiffering fundamentally from that of\nMussolini in Italy, in that it was not\nthe achievement of a great popular \nmovement like Fascism, but was purely\nmilitary in its basis.\n     A modern civilized nation may submit\nfor a considerable time to a government \nwhich represents a strong and\nvocal section of public opinion, even if\nit has not the support of a numerical\nmajority of the people, but it bitterly\nresents being dragooned by a military\ndespot set up not by any popular movement\nbut by armed forces of the crown.\n     King Alfonso is widely liked personally\nin this country, and there is a very\nstrong personal sympathy with his English\nQueen and her family.

In this picture \na colored soldier is seen on horseback \nnear the Commander in Chief. It \nis the same figure that is seen pulling \nthe oar in other sketches of that memorable \ncrossing. Prince Whipple is \nthe name of this colored soldier, body \nguard to Gen. Whipple of New \nHampshire. He was born in Africa of \nwealthy parents and was sent to this \ncountry to be educated, as an elder \nbrother had been.

Montgomery was lifted \nupon the walls of Fort Griswold and \ncalled upon the Americans to surrender, \nit was John Freeman, a colored \nman, who pinned him to the earth \nwith his pike. \n\nBut, one bent upon ascertaining the \ncolored man's contribution to the triumph \nof the Colonies over Great Britain \nhas set himself a task which is \nherculean indeed. It is possible to wade \nthrough tome over tome of the histories \nof that time without finding the \ninformation which one seeks. Of \ncourse, there is a reason for the historian's \nfailure to give the colored man \nthe credit which he so richly deserves. \nIn the majority of cases colored men \ndid not fight in organizations exclusively \ntheir own, as has already been \nstated. They were scattered throughout \nthe Army, two or three in a company \ncomposed of whites, a squad in \na regiment, a few companies with an \narmy, so that it was almost impossible \nto separate the record which they made \nas a racial group from that of their \nwhite comrades with whom they fought \nside by side. \n\nOne must undertake the gruelling \njob of reading painstakingly the history \nof villages and towns. One must \nbrowse carefully among the archives of \nthe States, must go over Army rolls\npatiently, name by name, in order to   \ndistinguish colored men from their \nwhite compatriots, so close was the\ncomradeship which existed between \nthem. It is possible only to give a \nbird's-eye view of the services rendered \nby colored men - citing a few of the \nbattles in which they engaged - relating \ntheir deeds of prowess either as \nindividuals or small groups. \n\nOne of the finest tributes ever bestowed \nupon colored soldiers in the \nRevolutionary War was delivered in the \nHouse of Representatives in 1820 by \nCharles Pinckney of South Carolina. \nAmong other things he declared that \n\"Negroes were then as they still are as \nvaluable a part of our population to the \nUnion as any other equal number of \ninhabitants.\" \"They were,\" he said, \"in \nnumerous instances the pioneers, and \nin all the laborers of your armies. To \ntheir hands were owing the erection of \nthe greater part of the fortifications \nraised for the protection of our country, \nsome of which, particularly Fort \nMoultrie, gave at the early period of \nthe inexperience and untried valor of \nour citizens immortality to American \narms; and in the Northern States numerous \nbodies of them were enrolled \ninto, and fought side by side with the \nwhites, the battles of the Revolution.\"\n\nIn this day and generation practically \neverybody clothed in his right \nmind stands aghast at the very thought \nof war.

Nevertheless, in reviewing \nthe valuable contributions made \nby colored soldiers in the struggle for \nindependence many will agree with \nJohn Greenleaf Whittier, the Quaker \npoet, who was asked to give some facts \nrelative to the military service of colored \nAmericans in the Revolution of \n1776 and the War of 1812. \n\nBeing a member of the Society of \nFriends, Mr. Whittier disclaimed any \ndesire to deliver a eulogy upon those \nwho shed human blood. \"But,\" he said, \n\"when we see a whole nation doing \nhonor to memories of one class of defenders \nto the total neglect of another \nclass, who had the misfortune to be of \ndarker complexion, we cannot forego \nthe satisfaction of inviting notice to \ncertain historical facts which for the \nlast half century have been quietly elbowed \naside.\"\n  \n     \n\n", "14", 48, 48, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00698", "WHAT YOU CAN DO\n\nIT IS the duty of colored people who want to smooth out \nsome of the rough places over which they have to travel\nevery day, and who wish to enjoy the privileges to \nwhich they are entitled as citizens, to support an organization \nlike the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom \nwhich is trying both to establish peace throughout the world \nand to remove many evils which arise from race prejudice.

It is also doing a great \ndeal to bring about a better understanding between the races. \nIn Boston, Detroit, Cleveland, Newark, Washington, and New \nYork there are active committees which carry on varied and \ninteresting programs, sometimes serious study courses, sometimes \nmusical or other entertainment which develop understanding \nand cooperation between groups. It is hoped that the \nlist of cities in which this work is organized will increase year \nby year. \n\nA special representative of the colored women works \namong the colored groups in Philadelphia, arranging meetings, \norganizing groups, and bringing the message of the W.I.L. to\nvarious church, business, and social groups. \n\nIn Philadelphia, am interracial group known as the Junior \nInternational league has been organized, with the aim of giving \nhigh school students of all races more opportunities for intellectual \ncontacts.\n\nA few years ago the W.I.L. sent a commission to Haiti, to \ninvestigate conditions there. The report which they made and \nthe suggestions which they recommended have in great measure \ninfluenced the policy of our State Department in a more \njust and liberal policy towards the Black Republic. \n\nThe W.I.L. has protested conditions of slavery in Liberia, \nand it took effective steps in protesting against the reported \nuse of slaves by an American firm in Abyssinia. In the conflict \nbetween China and Japan the League while working seriously\nto find measures which may help to end military aggression \nthere, has also kept in touch throughout with its Japanese and \nChinese members, encouraging and supporting them to hold \nfast to their principles of peaceful settlements. \n\nBelieving that much of the prejudice and ill-will is caused \nby ignorance, the educational work of the W.I.L. stresses a \nrecognition of the contributions of all races to the world civilization. \nMaterial for assembly programs, classroom projects, \nbibliography and reference material that emphasises the work \nof colored leaders in art, literature, music and science, is recommended \nto teachers throughout the country. This is done with \na two-fold purpose, namely: to foster more appreciative \nattitudes on the part of the white race, and to inspire colored \nboys and girls with a pride in the achievements of their own \npeople. \n \n", "17", 49, 49, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00668", "71\nwoman on my first trip abroad, so that I might see to day what was my pointoof\nview then. But, although my father's widow carefully preserved them a long\ntime, she tells me she can find none of them now. I know, however, that the\npriceless paintings in the Louvre and elsewhere opened up an entirely new world\nfor me. It was the first time I had ever either seen the works of the old masters and \nthe best specimens of the modern school and I rejoiced in this glorious opportunity\nof learning something about art. I was greatly impressed by the\nfine statues I saw and became deeply interested in sculpture.\nFew men could have been more wretched than was my father the morning he\nboarded the train in Paris, so as to take the steamer sailing home, and left me\nthere standing alone on the platform. He had solemnly promised to let me study abroad. [and]\nI had set my heart on it, and nothing in the world could have induced me to give\nup this cherished plan. As he stood in the station waiting for the train, Father\nbegged me to return home with him. \"But my clothes are in the hotel,\" I replied. \n\"Surely you do not want me to leave all my belongings here in Paris,\" I said.\nBut, if I had decided to do that, Father would have been one of the happiest men\nin the world. Although he rarely showed how deeply moved he was by anything,\nthere were tears in his eyes, when he kissed me good bye and left his young daughter \nin Paris alone.\nNot a tear was in my eye, however, for at last the time had come \nwhen I could do the work which I had planned so long. I was the happiest girl on\nearth. I am sure I felt as Monte Christo must have felt, when he exclaimed, \"The\nworld is mine.\" Here I was in Paris. I could study French, visit the wonderful \n[art] galleries to my heart's content, learn something about art and attend the\ntheaters. In short,here at last was the realization of these radiant dreams\nwhich had filled my head and my heart for years. Father had promised he would\nlet me study abroad a year, and I knew he wold keep his word . He would send\nme the money I needed and would permit me to do anything within reason. What\nmore could I want? Nothing to worry me. Not a care in the world, bubbling \nover with enthusiasm and youth!\nJust as soon as I could find a suitable pension I left the dear,\nlittle Hotel\n\n72\nlittle Hotel de Malte in the Rue de Richelieu and went  to board with a widow who\nwas highly recommended by one of Mrs. Hooker's friends. She was a typical French\nwoman who had a dear little niece, so that it was a decided advantage for me to\nsecure accommodations in such a home. My landlady gave me a French lesson every\nmorning shortly after serving the regulation coffee and roll. She was a most \nfaithful and capable teacher and worked hard to make my pronunciation and accent\ncorrect. By talking with her yojg niece, who could neither speak not understand\na word of English, I learned many expressions used in ordinary conversation\nnot generally found in books.\nLiving inParis was quite expensive even then. At least, I had to pay \nmuch more for my room and boardthan I cared to spend for those two items alone.\nMoreover, when I wanted to attend the theatre, it was necessary to have a chaperone,\nand pay for her ticket as well as my own , even when she did not expect an extra\nfee for her services. I chafed under this condition considerably.\nAn American girl who had left Paris and gone to Switzerland sent me\nthe addresses of several private families with whom I might board. After corresponding\nwith them I decided to go to Lausanne, Switzerland, without telling my\nfather I intended to leave Paris, because I feared he would object to my travelling\nin Europe alone. I had definitely made up my mind it would be more advantageous [better] for\nme in every way to go to Switzerland, and I thought it was better to make the\nchange without asking my father's permission than to do so, if he insisted upon\nhaving me remain in Paris. Having always respected my father's wishes, except \nwhen I accepted a position to teach, I did not want to break my record a second\ntime. I felt greatly handicapped in Paris, because at that time, comparitively\nfew American girls, as young as I was, went about the city alone. I knew that\nin the dear little Swiss Republic both English and American girls were accustomed\nto go about unaccompanied.\nBefore I left Paris I sent my father my Lausanne address and then waited\nin fear and tremblig for a reply.

How thrilling it would be to meet again the \ncharming women in relaxed and friendly mood, and recall some of the joint\nventures of the Club's baby days and early childhood. Among many tedious \nlong stories of unselfish alliances and contributions to worthy causes, there \nwould be the gorgeous purple day when our militants marched down the \nAvenue in parade with the National Women's Party demanding suffrage\nfor women. In 1918 some if us, bent on alleviating the wounds of battle, \nwith benign countenances and heads swathed in the long blue veils of Red \nCross nurses in devoted sisterhood, trailed through the dusty streets, strong \nin the faith that we were doing our bit to aid the war to end war. Perhaps\nall of us bought Liberty Bonds to buy ammunition in sufficient quantity \nto insure cases for Red Cross relief, still vainly believing that we were sacrificing \nthe present to end all wars. You could never guess that real heroism was \ndemanded by a group of us who chose to wear bands of crepe on our arms \nto give expression to our horror and grief, because of the military execution \nof thirteen Negro soldiers tried by court-martial in Texas. The memory \ncarried its depressing effects to this moment. And were we women terrorized?\nCharlotte Atwood and Georgina Simpson may answer. \n\nOh, yes, it was Sue White, among several others, of the National \nWomen's Party (Who remembers the names?) who had been put into the \nDistrict jail for picketing the White House and burning President Wilson \nin effigy. Who remembers that they tried to get us to participate in the \npicketing? Discretion that time was the better part of valor. But didn't we \nrelish their yarns? We wonder what has become of them. \n\nThe early and long continued beneficial relations with the Phyllis \nWheatley Young Women's Christian Association gives proof of the possibility, \nthe advantage, the desirability of cooperation with other groups \nwhich is more necessary today than ever. It was in the old Lincoln Temple \nChurch and in the old Tea Street Young Women's Christian Association\nand garden that our early annual receptions to the graduating girls of high \nschool and college were held. Curiously the most gratifying emotion compounded \nwith sweet and poignant memories of springtime in Washington, \nand springtime in the lives of those young women - gay, serious, eager - so \nbeautiful and attractive in their youth, mingling with the gracious, charming \nalumnae bent on the pleasant task of making the occasion a happy one, \nis blended with the recollection of these receptions. there was no propaganda - \njust making friends. In the whole of a long life I find nothing \nmore pleasant than the memory of, the anticipation, preparation for and\nthe participation in the day of the year when the girl graduates came to \n\nCOLLEGE ALUMNAE CLUB \n\n9\n\nmeet the College Alumnae Club. The girls liked it also. One of them, \nnow sleeping the churchyard sleep, after her brilliant college course and successful \nteaching career, told me it was on the afternoon with the \nCollege Club in her senior year at high school, that she resolved to become \na member of the club. \n\nDo you ask, \"What of them today, these pioneers?\" Not one has \nmarked time. All continued to grow and become leaders among women. \n\n1. Our proudest boasts are those how have college son and daughter \ngraduates. Let them stand and \"take the big hand.\"\n2.

With the professional\npessimist, be he white or black I have no patience at all. But if the\nwhite pessimist is a dangerous menace to the progress of colored people,\nthe colored man who hangs his harp on a willow tree and drones doleful\nJeremiads from day to day is the deadliest foe which his race is forced to\nface. The sooner this long-faced, prophet of evil is gathered to his fathers,\nputs on his golden slippers and sails around the heavenly ether with\nangelic wings, the better it will be for his immediate friends in particular,\nthe race on general principles and the public at large. It is unnecessary\nand unwise to go to either extreme in discussing what is called the\nrace problem. The optimist who sees nothing but roses and butterflies deals\nwholly in beautiful, irridescent visions of the future that can never be\nrealized, is anything but a safe guide. He has the best intentions, to be\nsure and his heart is in the right place, but his head is a bit unsound.\nIf placed between the extreme pessimist and the ultra optimist and obligated\nto choose between the two evils, I should certainly select the optimist\nas the less. The man who fills our heart with hope and forces us to\nbelieve in ourselves spurs us on to greater effort and thus make it possible\nfor us to accomplish vastly more than he who crushes us with prophecies\nof failure and despair. But like other things, there are optimists\nand optimists \u2013 the wise and the foolish variety, so to speak. It is quite\npossible for one to be an optimist, who looks on the bright side of life\n                                                       4\nand sees the blessings which he has without closing his eyes entirely to\nexisting conditions and without ignoring indisputable facts. In other\nwords, one can be an optimist without being an ignoramus. Those who believe\none must be an ignoramus in order to be an optimist know as much about the\nthat [           ]\nmeaning of the word optimist as did a certain theatrical manager about\nwhom Sydney Rosenfeld tells. Mr. Rosenfeld says that he was trying to find\na manger who would produce his play, \"The Optimist.\" \"I don't think much of\nthe title was the first mangers protest. \"Do you know what it means?\" asked\nRosenfeld. \"Certainly,\" was the impatient answer. \"An optimist is a man\nwho looks after eyes and a [  ] pessimist is one who attends to the feet.\"\nIt is also possible to be an optimistic without becoming a candidate for an\ninsane asylum. There are those who call themselves optimists, who are so\nexhilirated and satisfied with the cheerful manner in which they regard existing\nconditions as well as the bright prospects for the future that they\nfeel it unnecessary to put forth special efforts to improve affairs and are\nperfectly content to rest on their oars. Such alleged optimists remind of\na certain man about whom I once heard. A certain tourist came upon him\nwhile he was sitting stone still on a stup. \"Hows times\" asked the tourist.\n\"Pretty tolerable stranger\", replied the old man. scarcely turning his\nhead. \"What you doing here?\", asked the stronger. \"Oh I aint doing nothing\nnow\", replied the old man. \"I had some trees to cut down a little while\nago, but the cyclone leveled them and saved me the trouble.\" That was fine\"\nreplied the stranger. \"Yes it was\", continued the old man. But that aint\nall, I had to move some brush away from my lot/ but the lightning set fire\nto the brush and saved me the trouble of burning it.\" Well that was great\nluck\", said the stronger. But what are you doing here now?\" \"Oh, I am just\nwaiting for an earthquake to come along and shake the potatoes out of the\nground.\"\n     The white man who is always underestimating the ability of his colored\nbrother is undoubtedly a deadly foe, as I have already said, but the\n  \n \n\n  \n     ", "3", 49, 49, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00674", "83\nbecause one of his friends who had pursued a similar course, and had succeeded in\nmarrying an American girl with a lot of money.\nAlthough I was greatly amused and could scarcely conceal my disgust\nI felt sorry for the afflicted man and tried not to say anything which would\nwound his feelings. I declined his offer, however, in no uncertain terms saying\nI had been reared to believe that marrying for anything but live was a sin\nand that his cold-blooded proposition to enter holy matromony for any other\nreason shocked me beyond expression.\nWhile I was in Berlin I was greatly indebted to one of my colored friends\nfor several musical treats I enjoyed and for information concerning musical people\nwhich I could have secured from no other source.

We had stopped several times to admire\nthe wonderful display. I felt that somebody was following me and I turned around\nseveral times to see if I could discover any one. Once I thought I saw a man stop\nsuddenly quite a little distance behind me, but I was not sure, so I said nothing \nto my companion about it. We continued our stroll, stopping every now and\nthen to discuss the beautiful objects we saw. Just as we drew up to a window.\nI turned around suddenly and saw standing behind me a young man of my own race\nwith whom I had been well acquainted for years and who was studying music\nin Berlin.\nEverybody who has traveled abroad knows how happy he is, when he unexpectedly\nmeets an old friend. the young man said he suddenly spied me, as he\nturned the corner, and although he felt sure he recognized me, he could not believe\nthe evidence of his eyes, because he had not heard I had left the United\nStates to travel in Europe. He was so impressed with the resemblance I bore\nto the girl he knew at home, however, he decided to follow my companion and myself,\nuntil he could catch a good glimpse of my face, and he was just coming up\nto greet me, when I turned and saw him.\n\n\n\n84\nThis young colored American had remarkable talent for the violin.\nAt that time Joachim, one of the greatest teachers of violin of modern\ntimes, taught nobody who was not unmistakably talented in the violin. It was said that neither\nwealth, power, not high social standing could tempt this great master to teach\nanybody who was not a presumptive genius. It was rumored in Berlin that more\nthan one member of the aristocracy had implored Joachim to teach his son without\navail. But the great Joachim taught this young colored man from the United\nStates, so impressed was he with his superior talent. Instead of becoming a great\nviolinist, however, this young colored musician has become a renowned composer\nof popular music characteristic of his race.\nI met another young colored man who was studying music in Europe, because\nhe possessed great talent. He seemed listless rather than lazy and it pained\nme to hear from some of his friends that he was wasting his time. When I urged\nthis young man to avail himself of the marvellous opportunities and advantages\nwhich he enjoyed, he replied: \"What's the use of me trying to do anything\nextraordinary or worth while? A man must have some kind of a racial background\nto amount to anything. He must have a firm racial foundation in which to build.\nWhat have we acomplished as a race? Almost nothing\", he replied with disgust.\nWe are descended from slaves. How can you expect a people with such a background\nas that to compete successfully with white people?\"\nI argued with him long and loud to convince him that in spite of almost\ninsurmountable obstacles a few colored people had even then accomplished something\nworth while along several lines and that as a race we were rapidly forging\na head in many fields. I could not convert him to my point of view, however,\nand failed to prove to him how fatal to the race would be the general acceptance\nof such a theory as he advanced. One of that man's children has won a\nscholarship in an Eastern University which has enabled him to study abroad and\nthe son gives promise of having a brilliant and useful career. It is gratifying\nto observe that he does not seem at all obsessed with the idea that a man\nwith African blood in his veins is doomed to mediocrity at best. No young colored\nperson in the United States to day can truthfully offer as an excuse for lack", "18", 50, 50, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-024:00134", "9\n\nSurely such people cannot believe that they have a right to be numbered \namong the race's best friends. \n\nWhile discussing colored people whose main stock in trade seems to \nbe criticism of their own race, I should like to say a word or two about \nsome of the newspaper editors owned by colored people ostensibly in \nthe interest of their own race. Now it is impossible to overestimate the good\n which it is possible for race journals to do. In the life and progress of \nthe race they fill a niche which nothing could occupy without great detriment \nto its interests. It is the custom of some to sneer at race journals, \nI know, and speak of them contempt. Personally I hesitate to place \nthe high estimate upon them I believe they deserve for fear some will accuse me of exaggeration. \nIn my own work I could not get along without the valuable information contained \nin colored newspapers. They supply me with facts upon various phases of \nour race life which I could obtain from no other source. Those who speak \nor write upon the race question need nothing so much as facts, well authenticated,\n indisputable facts. When I wrote my article on Lynching from \na Negro's Point of View, and wished to prove the falsity of many of Thomas \nNelson's page's statements I had simply to turn to my scrap book filled \nwith numerous clippings, mostly from colored newspapers, which contained \naccounts of incidents clearly showing how many errors Mr. Page had made. \nFor instance, among other false statements which I found in Mr. Page's article \non Lynching was the one that innocent negroes are never lynched in \nthe South. But there on the pages of my scrap book were numerous instances \nof the lynching of colored men whose innocence had been established beyond \na doubt, after they had disappeared in flame and smoke or had been \nshot to death. And the majority of these facts concerning the race had \nbeen culled from colored newspapers. \n\nBut, like everything else, there are colored newspapers and colored \nnewspapers. There is no doubt that a few of our journals do positive harm, \nbecause they are in the business simply for the money they can get out of \n\n\n10\nit. But at this time, when the white press takes special pains to exploit \nour crimes and opens its columns to those who underestimate and slander \nus, while it practically closes them to our advocates and friends, surely \na race journal should not join the enemy's ranks by holding our foremost \nmen and women up to public contempt. Surely a journal avowedly published \nin the interests of the race should be the last in the world to stir up \ndissension and and strife by continually attacking those who stand in the \nfront ranks even if they cannot sanction all they do and say. \nFar be it from to muzzle the race or any other press. Nobody believes in \nfreedom of speech and freedom of the press more than myself. The editors \nof our race journals have a perfect right  to differ with the so-called \nleaders. More than that it is their bounden duty to do so. But - there \nis a right and a just way for our newspapers to differ with the \nleaders of their race and there is a wrong and unfair way of dissenting from their view.\n Some of our journals do not hesitate to proclaim from the \nhouse tops that the foremost men of the race with whose opinions they do \nnot agree are grafters of the deepest dye, are simply in the race business \nfor the money they hope to make. They go still further and declare that \nthese race leaders are in reality trying to betray the race to its arch \nenemy and sell it to its highest bidder. With no desire to do even such \njournals an injustice it seems to me there is no other judgment we can \npass upon them than to charge them with being the race's bitter foe. \n\nIt is perfectly right and proper for our journals to warn the race \nagainst accepting views which the editors believe to be hostile to its \nprogress. As I have already said, it is their duty to do so. But surely \nour editors can differ widely with the opinions expressed and the methods \npursued by so-called leaders without branding the men and women themselves \nas traitors and knaves. \n\nColored people should be the last ones in this \ncountry to sanction intolerance.

And this\nspirit of incessant rebellion and agitation against injustice & wrong is the great lesson which the colored\npeople of this country must learn. [ As a race we must learn the benefit] of\nincessant agitation and rebellion against wrong. We must resent the stealing\nof our votes, the ignoring of our rights, being deprived of the privileges\nand opportunities to which every human being is entitled and every\nother kind of injustice which organized oppression has perpetrated upon us.\nRemember always, when the overcautious tell you to be silent that Wendell\nPhillips once said, \"Agitation means freedom.\"\nThere is no doubt that peace is a blessing for which we should all\ndevoutly pray. I wish to urge no member of the race to play the role of\nDon Qixote and try to charge the fierce giant of prejudice and well entrenched\npower with a paper sword.

Nobody who\n\n18\n\nwould wilfully wound the spirit and crush the pride of another human being\nby telling him he was inferior, even if he believed it to be true,\nby placing a limit upon his achievement thru laws discriminating against\nhim and by creating a public sentiment hostile to him- nobody, I say,\nwho treated another human being in such a selfish, cruel, ungenerous manner\ncould justly be called his best friend. There is not an individual in\nthis room who would not feel grossly insulted, if I should tell him that\na man who impeded his progress in any possible way, was his best friend.\nThose who claim that the South is the colored man's best friend\nbase this contention upon the fact that colored people are employed in\nlarger numbers and in a greater variety of trades in the South than in the\nNorth- that the section which offers greater opportunities of earning a\nliving is a better friend than the one that offers less. In the first\nplace, let us acknowledge frankly that the white South employs the colored\nman from necessity rather than from choice and that in many sections to\nday desperate efforts are being made to displace the colored laborer by\nthe foreigner. Prominent southern men have been scraping Europe with a\nfine tooth comb all the summer to secure immigrants for the South and offering\nthem all kinds of inducements to cast their lot in their section.\nSo when I hear eloquent tributes paid to the South for the kind and generous\nmanner in which it employs him, I cannot help saying to myself that\nthis is a flagrant case of making a virtue out of necessity? But if it\nwere really true that in preference to other laborers  whom [they] it might\neasily employ the South voluntarily employed colored people and paid them\nsuch larfe wages that they might live on the fat of the land, then enacted\nlaws to humiliate, degrade them and deprive them of the rights which other\ncitizens no better, no more intelligent than themselves enjoy, theme such\ntreatment would be simply a mockery- as sounding brass and a tinkling symbal.\nFor, is not life more than meat?

I never tired seeing the monks themselves and the great stone struct\nures in which they lived and moved and had their being.

He had brought his whole family with him- his wife, Robert who was four years\nold and little Annette who was only two.

HOLMES\n\nEDUCATIONAL administrators and teachers are frequently embarrassed\n      when asked to state, in exact terms, just what they are\ntrying to produce.  This is particularly true in the United States,\nthe land dedicated to the principle of equality of opportunity.  In Western\nEurope where, in the past, higher education and lower education have been\nquite distinct, the definition of aims has not been so difficult.  Schools for\nthe lower classes were frankly organized to equip the masses with such tools\nas were considered necessary to produce efficient followers.  The higher\neducation, on the other hand, was looked upon as aristocratic, organized\nand carried forward for the express purpose of producing scholars and\nhence leaders in the social, industrial, scientific and political life of the\nnation.\n       America has set the pace in opening all the schools to all the people.\nBut, since all the people cannot be leaders, another objective than leadership\nwas obviously required, whose precise definition has eluded the ingenuity\n", "37", 48, 48, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00719", "38                                   THE JOURNAL OF THE\n\nof the most astute educational leaders.  At the present time, as one of the\nresults of the machine age, American economists are facing very frankly\nthe necessary postponement of the employment of youth as wage earners\nuntil the age of twenty-one or later.  Technological processes are so rapidly\ntaking over the burden of labor and thus freeing man from industrial\nslavery, that the postponement of the admission of people to productive\nlife until the age of maturity seems imminent.  After the social adjustments\nnow in process shall have been completed, it is not at all unlikely, therefore,\nthat we shall find that the normal education period of the masses will\ncontinue through what are now considered the years of college life. Should\nthis come to pass, we surely cannot use the vague term \"leadership\", as descriptive\nof our educational objective.  Under such conditions we shall probably\nbe forced to adopt Mickeljohn's definition of the objective of college\neducation as being \"the process of learning how to live.\"  This designation\nof aim, however, is even more vague than \"leadership\" when one attempts\nto find its exact significance.  But this should not disturb us because some\nof the rarest values cannot be defined but must be exemplified in order to\nbe understood.  Any description of a dynamic person, for example, always\nleaves something to be desired.  To see such a person in action, however, is\nquite satisfying and informative.  Personality, bravery, honor and industry,\nare examples of terms that, to be best understood, must be experienced.\n     If this brief analysis is valid, a college can best describe what it is\ntrying to do by choosing from among its graduates who are actively engaged\nin doing the work of the world, those who exemplify in their lives the\nideals which it has set up. Indeed the success or failure of higher education\nmust be determined, in the long run, by this procedure.  Do college-bred\nmen and women live better, act differently, do more, affect the group more\nfavorably, than do those who have not had the opportunities implied by a \ncollege degree?  It is because educators have begun to realize the futility of\nobjective standards in determining the quality of an educational institution\nthat the standardizing movement among colleges has, within the last two\nyears, begun to undergo an important modification.  The North Central\nAssociation of Colleges and Secondary Schools, one of the most active of\nthe educational bodies during the past three decades in the establishment and\napplication of objective measurements for the accreditation of institutions\nof higher learning, has definitely scrapped these standards as having outlived\ntheir usefulness.  Instead, it plans to evaluate colleges on the basis of\ntheir ability to meet stated objectives as determined largely be an examination\nof their product.  Thus, such requirements as the value of the plant, the\nsize of the endowment, the teaching load, the preparation of the faculty,\nthe number of students and the like, are no longer looked upon by this\n\n                                         COLLEGE ALUMNAE CLUB                              39\n\nbody as infallible indices of the quality of a college.  According to their\nnew plan, it first inquires of each college just what it is trying to do and\nthen judges its quality in accordance with its success or failure in realizing\nits aim.\n     If, on this basis, one is asked to determine the value of college education\nto Negro women, he has but to turn his attention to the College\nAlumnae Club of Washington, D. C., to find the the answer.  This group of\nwomen, on the occasion of its twenty-fifth anniversary, answers in no uncertain\nterms the question proposed.  The several colleges whose degrees are\nheld by these women need only point to them and say, \"Here is what we have\nbeen trying to produce in supplying higher education to Negro women.\"\nFor the organization has done much in the very complex social community\ncomposing the nation's capital, to raise the tone of the cultural life and in\nso doing has exemplified, in the best manner possible, the transformation in\nquality and character that college education should make in human beings.\nLet us, for a moment, apply the criteria proposed above in evaluating the \nwork of this organization.  We just asked the question, \"Do college-bred\nmen and women live better, act differently, do more, affect the group more\nfavorably than do others who have not had the opportunities implied by a \ncollege degree?\"  To each of these questions the reply is decidedly positive.\nThat the members of this body live better can easily be inferred from an\nexamination of the roster of membership with the positions held and a\nstudy of the social activities engaged in, both individually and collectively,\nby its members.  They act differently from persons not so trained because of\nthe added cultural outlook and the added feeling of responsibility which\nhas come to them through their intellectual and spiritual experiences.  They\ndo more, not only because they see more to be done, but because they have\nthe training to do things and the desire and willingness to cooperate with\neach other which makes their efforts more effective than they could possibly\nbe if carried on individually.  They affect the group more favorably because\nthey have undertaken projects, educational, social and artistic, which have\nvery definitely influenced, in a positive way, the life of the city of Washington\nand of other communities as well.\n     It is not the purpose of this brief statement to specify in detail what\nthis organization has done during the quarter-century of its existence, for\nthis is done elsewhere in this volume.  By way of illustration, however, it\nseems fitting to call attention to the general quality of the activities in which\nit has been engaged by specific examples.  After several years of existence,\nthe club realized that the thing which it was doing in Washington could be\nfar more extensive in its influence if given wider scope.

These are some of the questions \nthat college women in any community, but what they contribute to the quality \nof the life of the place where they live is the primary consideration. \n\nIn such a period as we are now passing through, every individual must \nappraise his life in terms of social usefulness. This is especially true of \nthose who have been exposed to the culture, the intellectual and spiritual \nheritage of the world. The college woman, having studied the history, literature, \nart, and science accumulated and transmitted to us by the scholars\nof the past, should be prepared in our troubled times to diagnose and prescribe \nwith some degree of wisdom a remedy for some of the ills that so \nbeset the modern world. Since Negro college women can no more escape \nthis duty and responsibility than any other college women, they should be \nalert to see their task and eager to address themselves to it.    \n\nI wish to call attention to only three areas in which it seems to me \nNegro college women should concern themselves especially. In a democracy\nsuch as we live in, the citizen is the source of power. He expresses his  \ndesires, his will, his hopes through the power of his vote at the polls. Unfortunately, \nNegro citizens in many sections of our country are denied the \nopportunity of so expressing their desires; but, fortunately, in several sections\nof our country we hold the balance of power and through this power \nwe can control those influences and policies that mean life or death for us. \nHave our college women studied carefully the conditions in these areas and  \nused their knowledge and skills in educating the masses to use their latent \npower through the wise exercise of the franchise? Never in the history of \nthe United States was an educated and organized citizenry needed more \nthan it is today? Government is reaching down into every activity of our \nlives, but do Negro college women apply their knowledge of political science, \ntheir knowledge of history to influence government to the advantage \nof humble citizens? Do we look with disdain and indifference upon what \nwe so often term \"dirty politics?\" Leadership in the field of government \nshould come from those who understand the meaning of this word; from \nthose who have had the opportunity through their college courses to know that \na democracy cannot serve its citizens except through the wisdom of those \n\nCOLLEGE ALUMNAE CLUB \n\n45\n\ncitizens. Plato's admonition that only philosophers should rule the state \nshould be pondered deeply y college women to the end that they and those \nwho look to them for guidance shall be able to live in the state in security\nand happiness. What, in the past twenty-five years, have Negro college \nwomen done in this field? It seems to me that the first duty of college women \nis to inform themselves thoroughly on economic and political problems confronting \nour citizens and to furnish the masses of our people with guidance \nin a democratic state. \n\nClosely related to our national problems is our international relations. \nFor the past twenty-five years, Negro college women have had almost nothing \nto say on international matters probably because they seem so remote \nfrom them. However, when we consider that in the interests of Negro \nAmericans as well as the interests of other Americans are involved every \ninternational problem facing out country today, those of us who hold \ncollege degrees should be deeply concerned with this phase of American \nlife. Probably the gravest problem before the world is that of war. For \nthe past ten years, eleven of the largest and most influential women's organizations \nin America have met in Washington annually to consider the \n\"Cause and Cure of War.\" These women realize that the education of \npublic opinion on this subject is the first step in the direction of getting a \nsolution for the problem. Year after year they have presented facts on the \nenormous cost of war in human life and goods - facts which should appeal   \nto and appall every intelligent man and women in America. What are college \nwomen of our race doing to to acquaint our people with the fact that war is \nthe most wasteful, futile and inhuman method of settling international disputes \nthat man has ever tried? What are we doing to connect ourselves\nwith these general movements and organizations that have for their purpose \nthe turning of the waste of war into the constructive uses of mankind?\nAmple money could be saved, if war were abolished, to endow enough institutions \nof learning to meet the needs of every child in the United States. \nAre we as college women acquainted with the Women's International\nLeague for Peace; the National Council for the Prevention of War; the \nInternational Federation of University Women and similar organizations?\nShould we not work actively in these organizations as hundreds of college \nwomen are doing? As informed citizens we cannot shirk our responsibility \nin this field. \n\nIn looking forward to our future, we must be conscious of the stress \nand strain which the intricacies of modern life have put upon us. We must \nalso recognize that the intelligently trained person must provide for himself \na refuge from the perplexities of the present, and resources for hours of \nrecreation. It appears, then, that regardless of the major interests of college \nwomen, they must give the arts a place in their program of spiritual and    \n ", "41", 49, 49, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00696", "[*125-*]\nI urged her not to make the matter public, until I had had a chance to talk to \nthe teacher. When I told her this teacher that I knew she had married in Baltimore several \nmonths previously, she confessed the truth. At the end of the month she resigned \nand had a wedding to which her friends were invited. I have never been able to understand \nwhy those in authority should insist upon creating a sensation by publishing broadcast \nan unfortunate incident which has happened in the schools when the matter \ncan be adjusted quietly without injuring the reputation or the interests of \nanybody concerned. \n\nAs I look back upon my record as a member of the School Board, I am happy \nin the belief that I did everything in my power to promote the welfare of the \npupils, facilitate the work of the teachers and raise the standards in every possible \nway. So long as I had charge of the Tenth Division, I visited the schools \nfrequently. I made strenuous efforts to become personally acquainted with the       \nteachers, so that I might have first-hand knowledge of their temperament, their \nmethods of teaching and their manners toward their pupils in the school room and \nhelp them in every way I could. Several deserving teachers owe not only their \nappointments but their retention in the school system solely to my efforts in \ntheir behalf. It sometimes happened that hostile forces worked against them vigorously, \neither because there was personal animosity, or because \"the other fellow\" \nsimply wanted the job for himself or for one of this friends. In such an \nemergency the individual who is being fought must have a friend at Court to present \nhis side of the case, if he is to succeed. And I tried conscientiously to \nbe the friend, when I felt that by so doing, I could thwart an attempt at injustice \neither to the teacher or to the schools. \n\nAnd what a joy it was to work with the teachers in the colored schools \nof Washington, D.C! Take them by and large a finer group of human beings can \nnot be found anywhere in the world. They are a picked lot indeed. And there is \na reason. Among colored people school teaching offers one of the most desirable \nvocations in which well-educated people can enter. Particularly is this true of \nthe women of the race. Consequently those best equipped mentally and spiritually \nare eager to secure positions as teachers either in the public schools or in the \n\n[*126-*]\ncolleges for colored youth. Therefore, in the colored High Schools of Washington \nD.C. as well as in the grades may be found colored men and women who have graduated with honor and wear Phi Beta Kappa pins from the best universities and \ncolleges in the United States.

[Stop Health 10] It is often difficult, I know, to persuade [those] people who need help \nmost to avail themselves of the assistance offered by those who wish to lift them to a \nhigher plane. If it were possible for us to send out a National Organizer, \nwhose duty it should be to form clubs throughout the length and \nbreadth of the land, it would be no easy matter, I am sure, to persuade \nsome of our women to join them, even though they knew that by so doing \nthey would receive just that kind of instruction and counsel, which \nthey greatlyneed. This fault is not peculiar to our women, but is common \nto the whole human race. Difficult, though it be for us to uplift \nsome of our women, many of whose practices in their own homes and in the \nservice of their employers rise like a great barrier to our progress, \nwe should nevertheless work unceasingly to this end, until we win their \nconfidence, so that they will accept our aid.\n\nThrough such clubs as I have just mentioned, the attention \nof our women might be called to the alarming rapidity with which they \nare losing ground in the world of labor- a fact patent to all, who observe \nand read the signs of the times. So many families are supported entirely\nby our women, that if this movement to withhold employment from\nthem continues to grow, we shall soon be confronted by a condition of\nthings, serious and disastrous indeed. It is clearly the duty of\nthis, the only organized body of Colored women in the country to study\nthe labor question, not only as it affects the women, but also as it\naffects the men. [Stop]  When those who formerly employed Colored women as\ndomestics, but who refuse to do so now are asked why they have established\nwhat is equivalent to a boycott against us, they invariably tell \nus that Colored women are now neitherskilled in the trades, nor reliable \nas working women? While we know that in the majority of cases Colored\nwomen are not employed, because of the cruel, unreasonable prejudice\nwhich rages so violentl against them, rather than because of lack of skill there is just enough truth in the\ncharge of poor workmanship and unreliability to make us wince when it\n\n8\nis preferred. \n\nTo stem this tide of popular disfavor against us should be \nthe desire and determination of every Colored woman in the country, who\nhas the interest of her race at heart. It is we, the National Association,\nwho must point out to our women how fatal it will be to their\nhighest, best interests, and to the highest, best interests of their\nchildren, if they do not build up a reputation for reliability and proficiency.\nBy establishing schools of domestic science, as soon as our\nmeans will permit, and it is the duty of this Association to raise funds\nto start a few of these schools immediately, we should probably do more\nto solve the labor questions, so far as it affects the women than by using\nany other means we could possibly employ. [Read]  Let us explain the situation\nas we may, the fact remains, that trades and avocations, which \nformerly by common consent belonged almost exclusively to our men and \nwomen are gradually slipping from their grasp.\n\nWhom does such a condition of things affect more directly\nand disastrously than the women of the race? As parents, teachers and \nguardians, we teach our children to be honest and industrious, to cultivate\ntheir minds, to become skilled workmen, to be energetic and then to \nbe hopeful. It is easy enough to impress upon them the necessity of\ncultivating their minds, and becoming skilled workmen, of being energetic, honest and industrious, \nbut how difficult it is for colored women to inspire their\nchildren with hope, or offer them an incentive for their best endeavor\nunder the existing condition of things in this country.\n\n     As a mother of the dominant race looks into the innocent sweet\nface of her babe, her heart thrills not only with happiness in the present,\nbut also with joyful anticipations of the future. For well she knows\nthat honor, wealth, fame and greatness in any vocation he may choose are\nall his, if he but possess the ability and determination to secure them.\nShe knows that if it is in him to be great, all exterior circumstances,\nwhich can help him to the goal of his ambition, such as the \nlaws of his country, the public opinion of his countrymen,\nand manifold opportunities are all his, without the\nasking. From his birth he is king in his own right, and is no suppliant \nfor justice.\n\n     But how bitter is the contrast between the feelings of joy", "5", 56, 56, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-020:00552", "9\nand hope which thrill the heart of the white mother and those which stir\nthe soul of her Colored sister. As a mother of the weaker race clasps\nto her bosom the babe which she loves with an affection as tender and\ndeep as that the white mother bears her child, she cannot thrill with\njoyful anticipations of the future.  For before her babe she sees the\nthorny path of prejudice and proscription his little feet must tread.\nShe knows that no matter how great his ability or how lofty his ambition,\nther are comparitively few trades and avocations in which any one\nof his race may bope to succeed. She knows that no matter how skillful\nhis hand, how honest his heart, or how great his need, trades unions\nwill close their doors in his face and make his struggle for existence\ndesperate indeed. So rough does the way of her infant appear to many a\npoor Colored mother, as she thinks of the hardships and humiliations, to\nwhich he will be subjected, as he tries to earn his daily bread, that\ninstead of thrilling with joy and hope, she trembles with apprehension\nand despair.\nThis picture, though forbidding to look upon is not over \ndrawn, as those who have studied the labor question in its relation to\nour race can testify. What, then, Sisters of the Association, shall we\ndo? Shall we sit supinely by, with folded hands, drooping heads, and\nweeping eyes, or shall we be up and doing, determined to smooth out the \nrough roads of labor, over which tiny feet that now patter in play will\nsoon stumble and fall?  To our own youth, to our owm tradesmen, we must\npreach effiency, reliability, through preperation for any work in which\nthey choose to engage.  Let us also appeal directly to the large-hearted,\nbroadminded women of the dominant race, and lay our case clearly before\nthem.  In conversing with many of them privately I have discovered that\nour side of the labor question has never been made a living, breathing,\nterrible reality to them.  In a vague way they know that difficulties do\nconfront Colored men and women, in their effort to secure employment,\nbut they do not know how almost insurmountable are the obstacles which\nlie in the path of the rank and file,who want to earn an honest living.\nLet us ask these women both to follow tthemselves and teach their children\nthe lofty principles of humanity , charity and justice which they\nprofess to observe.  Let us ask that they train their children to be\n\n\n10\njust and broad enough to judge men and women by their intrinsic merit , \nrather than by the adventitious circumstances of race or color, or creed.\nLet this Association of Colored women ask the white mothers of this\ncountry to teach their children, that, when they grow to be men and women,\nif they deliberately prevent their fellow creatures from earning\ntheir daily bread, the Father of all men will hold them responsible for\nthe crimes, which are the result of their injustice, and for the human\nwrecks, which the ruthless crushing of hope and ambition always makes.\nIn the name of our children, let us ask, also , that they do all in \ntheir power to secure for our youth opportunities of earning a living\nand of attaining unto the full stature of manhood and womanhood, which\nthey desire for their own. In the name of justice and humanity, in the\nname of the innocence and helplessness of childhood, black childhood, as\nwell as white childhood, let us appeal to the white mothers of this country\nto do all in their power to make the future of our boys and girls\nas bright and as promising as should be that of every child, born on\nthis free American soil. ** An omission here _\nAs individuals, we have presented our case, again and\nagain.

We are the only group here \n[who] which has a double handicap to carry- the handicap of race as well as that of sex. \nWhite women all over the civilized world showed what a heavy handicap they \nthought race was by the desperate efforts they made to secure suffragel \nBut they had only one handicap. I wonder what they would have done if they \nhad had TWO!\nFor women suffrage is undoubtedly a weapon of defense. And now that \nwe have it,it will be a shame and a reproach to us if we do not use it. There \nis no doubt that some of the disadvantages under which we labor may be removed \nor lessened by our vote if it is properly used.\nAt a meeting which I attended not long ago it was suggested that \nwe should consider the political issues, not as colored women, but simply as \ncitizens without regard to race. Theoretically, that is [undoubtedly] a high \nstand to take without a doubt. But, practically, I can not see how a colored \nwoman can follow that advice with justice to herself, her family and her race. \nIt is a colored woman's duty, of course, to inform herself as thoroughly as \npossible about all the issues which confront us. She should know what the \nNew Deal means  and what the various agencies under the present administration \nhave done, particularly as their activities have affected her race. \nBut I don't see how colored people can possibly forget what each of \nthe two leading parties [have] has stood for in [their] its attitude toward our group. \nSome of my friends laugh at me, when I review the benefits derived by us \nfrom the Republican Party. \"That's handkerchiefheaded stuff,\" they ridicule. \nForget it. Colored people have fully repaid the Republican Party for everything \nit has done. Forget the past.\" But I don't see how it is possible for \npeople in our group who are clothed in their right minds to FORGET THE PAST. \nEven if I could forget the Republican past I certainly could not blot from \nmy mind the record of the Democratic party. No matter what sins of omission \nor commission the Republican Party might commit I can not forget what it did \n\n2\nfor the race when it was powerless to help itself. I know full well that \nthere are men and women in the Democratic Party whose minds are broad enough \nand whose hearts are big enough to take in all race and I believe mand of \nthem  try to be just. But I know also that no matter how good may be their \nintentions and no matter how fair may be their promises they are not  bigger \nand stronger than the party to which they belong.\nIn a national election I do not see how  colored people can vote \nfor a party that has systematically and continuously deprived them of rights \nto which they are entitled. [Every law that has been enacted to impede the progress] Just recently a \"Right to Vote\" campaign has been \nstarted in Birmingham, Alabama, so as to nullify the \"lily white\" \nlaws which were passed in 1901. As a rule Jefferson County has had barely 500 \ncolored qualified voters out of a total population of nearly 150,000. \nWhen six Jefferson County school teachers failed to receive their certificates \nfor which they had applied cases were filed against the Board of Registrars \nwho were asked to state the reasons for denying the certificates. But before \nthese cases could be tried in Court the certificates arrived for each of the \nsix teachers without any explanation of the long delay. The attention of Federal \nauthorities has been called to the denial of civil rights and it is believed \nthat as a result of the effort made by the colored people of Birmingham \nthey will have the unqualified right to vote throughout the State.\nIn practically every state of that section controlled by the Democratic \nparty the constitutional amendments enated by the Republican party to \nconfer citizenship upon colored people have by trickery, fraud and violence \n[have] been openly and flagrantly violated for years.And today the Democratic \nparty is making a special effort in several states to disenfranchise the women of the race.[in] \n[several States].

Ignorance \nof the various phases of this widespread lawlessness in the United States \nis as deplorable as it is dense. Those who do not inherit it from their \nancestors or absorb it from their environment, achieve it or have it \nthrust upon them. Achieving erroneous opinions about the negro is the \neasiest thing in the world. The chief joy of many consists in thrusting \ntheir own bad opinions of the negro upon anybody whose ear they can catch \nand upon whose credulity they can impose. \nLynching in the United States can never be suppressed, until the underlying \ncause is better understood by those who are genuinely anxious to throttle \nit. The reasons why the whole subject is so deeply and seriously involved   \nin error are obvious. Those who live in the section where nine \ntenths of the lynching occur do not dare to tell the truth, even if they \nperceive it. When men know that the death knell of their aspirations and \nhopes will be sounded as soon as they express views to which the majority \nin their immediate vicinage are opposed, either they suppress them or turn \nthem to fit the popular mind. Only martyrs are brave and bold enough to \ndefy the public will, and the manufacture of martyrs in the negro's behalf [for the defense of\nthe negro at least] is not very brisk just now. Perhaps the supply is as \ngreat as the demand. Those who do not live in the section where most of \nthe lynchings occur borrow their views from their brothers who do, and so \nthe errors are continuously repeated and inevitably perpetuated. \nIn the first place it is a great mistake to suppose that rape is the \nreal cause of lynching in the South. This is no more the cause of lynching \n[*Beginning with the Ku Klux Clans*] than it was the cause of the Ku Klux Clans and [*3*] (to come[all the other forms of \norganized violence) [to which] (the negro has been constantly subjected) in the [*4*]\nSouth, ever since he became free.) (That Rape is simply the pretext for lynching \nand not the cause.) [(It is easy to prove) the truth of this assertion.] \nStatistics show that out of every hundred negroes who are lynched from seventy \nfive to eighty five are not even accused of this crime, and many who\n\n\n\n[II]\n4\nNegroes who have been educated in northern institutions of learning with \nwhite men and women and who for that reason might have learned the meaning \nof social equality and have acquired a taste for the same neither assault \nwhite women not commit other crimes as a rule. When rape is actually \ncommitted by negroes, the criminal is almost without exception a human \nbeing who has been reared like an animal, deprived of opportunity without education, in the midst [*surrounding*]\nof degradation and vice, a stranger to aspiration and hope, A careful review \nof the facts will show that negroes who have the convention habit \ndeveloped to a high degree or who are able to earn their salt by editing newspapers, \n[negroes] those who are always held up by southern gentlemen as objects \nof ridicule, contempt and scorn do not belong to the criminal class. Altho\nBut strange as it may appear, the illiterate negroes whoare the only ones \nwho contrubut[e]ing largely to the criminal class are coddleed and caressed by \nthe South. They are the objects of undying affection and unstinted praise. \nThey are held up by Southern whites as bright and shining [lights] examples of what a good negro really \nis to the educated, cultivated members of the race. Honors fall upon them \nthick and fast. Webster's Unabridged is searched in vain by the average \nsouthern gentleman or gentlewoman for words sufficiently ornate and stron \nto express the deep admiration for a dear old mamy or a faithful old \nuncle who can neither read nor write and who would not, scorn to so offend their ex master or mistress if they could. \nNo language is sufficiently caustic, bitter and severe to express the disgust, \nhatred and scorn which the avergae southern gentleman feels for what \nis called the New Issue which being interpreted means - the negroes who aspire to culture and who have a \ntaste for the highest and best things in life. At the door of this New Issue \nthe sins and shortcomings of the whole race are laid. And the New Issue \nis siad to be beyond of redemption a hopeless case, because somebody, nobody knows who, ha \ntaught it to believe in social equality.

If [neither] the usual crime [nor] for which the teaching of social equality, said to be directly responsible as [is] the cause of lynching, to what may this wide spread \nlawlessness of which the negro is so frequently the victim be attributed?\nAt the last analysis it will be discovered that there is just [one] 2 causes\nfor lynching- In the 1st place It is due to race hatred, the hatred of the stronger people\ntoward a weker who were once held as slaves. In the second place Lynching [is also] due to the \nlawlessness of all classes so prevalent in that section where nine tenths of the lynchings \noccur View the question of lynching from any point of view one may \nand it will be seen that the negroes of this country [the present time] are as powerless \nto prevent mob violence by any atitude of mind which they may assume or any course of conduct they may pursue as their great grand parents [were powerless] would have been insanity to [suppress] prevent\nthe acts of violence by which they were dragged from their African \nhomes The same spirit of intolerance and of hatred which called into being \nthe KuKlux clans, has prompted the [various] more recent exphibitions of hostility toward \nthe negro, such as the Wilmington Riot, the disfranchisement acts, the \nJim Crow Car Laws, the new slavery called peonage, which is more brutal \nthan the old and other oacts of of opression to which the negro has been \nsubjected, ever since he became free\nThe underlying cause of lynching harks backfurther than the date of the \nfirst case of [rape upon] assault upon a white woman by a negro Lynching is the aftermath \nof slavery The white men who shoot negroes to death and flay them alive to day \nand the women who apply hot torches to their iol soaked bodies are the \nsons and daughters of women who had little compassion on the racewhen it \nwas in the house of bondage The men who lynch negroes to day are as a \nrule the children of women who sat by their fire sides happy and proud in \nthe possession and affection of their own children, while they looked with \nunpitying eye and adamantine heart upon the anguish of slaves mothers \nwhose children had been sold away.

It opened its session on Monday, July 29, 1895. Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin called the meeting to order at 10 A.M. Distinguished people spoke; representative women read papers; the convention went into secret session to discuss Jack's letter; resolutions were passed, and finally, the conven- discussed forming a national organization.\nMrs. Helen Cook, president of the National Colored Women's League was present, and according to the Era's August, 1895, report of the meeting, Mrs. Cook was allowed time to make the necessary explanations regarding the National League.\" It was \"proposed that a national organization be now formed,\n\n\n8\nwith its own laws, officers, constitutions, etc.\" This motion prevailed, and a committee on organization, consisting of one delegate from each delegation was appointed. A discussion followed as to a clause looking to a union with the Colored Women's National League. A committee was appointed to perfect the organization. Names of the candidates for whom the delegates should vote for offices, were given to the convention. It was voted \"to frame the constitution, that the Women's Era be made the organ of the national organization.\" and \"that the name of the new organization be laid over.\" It was also voted that \"the officers and Executive Board of the Colored Women's National League for the purpose of effecting a union.\" The meeting was adjourned \"subject to the call of the Pres.

When he entered the sanctuary where in his childhood\nhe had gone with Mary, and saw the upturned faces of his boyhood's\nplaymates, surely he would wish to speak of something vital to\nhis gospel.

It was a regular day coach divided into two parts,and the front I was\npart of it being used for a smoker for white men as well as colored, and the rear half serving as passenger coach fo\ncolored women and men who did not want to smoke. Instantly I knew that this\nwas the Jim Crow Car about which I had heard but had never seen. I felt as \nthough I had been trapped, but I resolved that I would not remain in it.\nI tried to leave it and go into the car ahead of me, but the conductor barred\nthe way. When he came thru the Jim Crow Car to collect the tickets, I told\nhim I did not want to remain in the coach to which the porter had diected me,\nbut that I wanted to sit in the coach ahead of me. The conductor informed me\nthat I was in the coach in which I belonged. \"But I have a first class ticket\"\nI protested, and this is not a first class coach.\" \"This is first class enough\nfor you,\" he replied sarcastically. Then I tried to compose myself and make\nup my mind to remain where I was.

[Naturally each[ [Since it wa] organization\nAfter a great deal\nof discussion it was decided to name the child of this union The National Association\nof Colored Women. And then the most difficult task of all was encountered.\nWho should be the first president? That was indeed the question.\n[If one of the organizations] \nIt is safe to assert that the name of no colored woman who had achieved prominence of\nany kind anywhere in the United States failed to be presented for consideration.\nThe name of practically every woman who was a member of the Joint Committee \nwas also mentioned for the office not only once but in several cases more than once. When this happened, the result of\nthe roll (no matter whose name was presented) usually showed that every woman [of the committee] half of the committee to which the candidate proposed [on her side of the\nhouse] for consideration voted for her, while every woman [of] on the other half voted for somebody\nelse and this went on. Over and over again the teller would report that Miss A had 7 votes and\nMiss B had seven. And so this went on [practically all day long] indefinitely, until most of us had very little hope that anybody in the As could be\nelected on that day, if it were ever possible to do so.Finally, after my name had already been presented earlier in the day, I\nwas nominated again & received the majority of the votes and was elected first\npresident of the National Association of Colored Women. It was nearly six\no'clock when the president of the Ass was elected and the Joint Committee had been in session practically all day long.\nAlthough we were all worn to a frazzle, we had to be at the church for the\nevening session which began at eight. So we had to rush home take a\nbite, get ready for the evening meeting & rush back to the church.\nNaturally I felt it was a great honor to be elected president of the\norganization and I was especially gratified, because the members of the Committee [on the other side of the house] of which I was not a part who finally broke the deadlock declared that they had done so, because\nmy fairness as Chairman convinced them that I was the right woman for the\nplace. It was a great undertaking for a young woman with little experience\nand it required prodigious effort, not to mention patience, to [build] establish the organization\non a firm foundation, so that the superstructure would be secure.\nI decided that whatever else I tried to do, the ideals should be high.\nIn assisting with the constitution I suggested that no woman should serve\nas president longer than two terms. I feared that some of the women whom I\nwanted very much to hold in the new Association might lose interest, if they\nfelt it would be [impossible] for them to become its president, because some\nwoman might be elected over and over again.", "12", 66, 66, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00030", "The diplomat must obey the law of Christ. He must be brotherly. His\nambition must be to help, and he must do his work within sight of the\nprinciple of sacrifice. The mailed fist must go -- only the pierced\nhands can lift the world to new levels. Love is the mightiest force\nin the universe. Let us believe it and act upon it. Scientists are\nnot ashamed of the law of gravitation. It is inexorable, unchangeable,\nand those who ignore it perish. Let us not apologize for the\nlaw of love. It also is unalterable, inflexible, and those who violate\nit are ground to powder. The world is in its present deplorable\ncondition solely because of the long continued and outrageous trampling\nupon the law of love.\nIf a government have not the spirit of Christ it is none of his.\nIf it lack his spirit it is doomed. Its wealth will not save it, nor\nits learning, nor its genius, nor its military power. If a nation\nhave not the spirit of Christ it must go down. Let us press this upon\nthe mind and conscience of the world. Let us put it in the forefront\nof all our teaching. God has made of one flesh every nation of men\nto dwell on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed\nseasons and the bounds of their habitations. Corporate life\nis ordained of God, and ruled by him. National development is held\nin the grip of unchanging and irresistible law. God is love, and rulers\nand statesmen lead nations to the abyss if they refuse to obey the\nlaw of love. Nations, like individuals, live and move and have their\nbeing in God (namely in love). No nation lives to itself. Every nation\nis vitally related to every other nation, and all nations are\nbound up in the life of the Lord of love. A nation which refuses to\ndo justly and love mercy and walk humbly with its neighbors in the\npath of brotherly service and goodwill is sooner or later dashed to\npieces like a potter's vessel. Those who doubt this should read\nhistory.\nInternational Realm\nIt is in the international realm that the church must, through\nthe coming centuries, perform its most zealous and arduous labor. The\nworld is sick and the church must heal it. The world is torn by evil\nspirits, suspicion and fear, and greed and injustice, and hate and revenge,\nand all those must be cast out. The church is commissioned to\ncast out demons. War is a demon. War must go. We must have a warless\nworld if we are to have any world at all. Let us demand in the\nname of Christ that preparations for war throughout shall cease. Preparing\nfor war leads to war. Let us insist that target practice shall come\nto an end. Let us denounce it as blasphemy against God, a conscienceless\ntrampling on our word to the young men who went out to die in the\ngreat war, heartened by our promise that that would be the last war.\nLet us cry out unitedly against the building of battleships, those\nbreeders of fear, and against the construction of bomb-dropping aeroplanes,\nthose fomentors of hate, and against the creation of al those\ninstruments of death whose very existence arouses suspicion and poisons\non the springs of international goodwill.\nGod calls all men to repent. To repent is not to cry or to feel\nbad. We have cried enough. To repent is to change one's mind. God\ncommands us to change our ways of thinking. We think like men, and \nthe world can never become better or happier until we think like God.\nWe think like God only when we think like Christ. When we think like\nChrist we think in terms or justice and mercy, of tenderness and forgiveness\nand goodwill. When we think like Christ we believe in men.\nWe trust them, we suffer long and still are kind. We are patient\nwith them, and we forgive them when they do us wrong.

I remembered all too distinctly that Texarkana was the \nfirst city in the South in recent years in which a colored man had been\nburned to death, which did not comfort me much. I would rush to the little\nbalcony, I hastily resolved, and jump to the ground. If that did not kill me,\nI thought, it might stun me sufficiently not to be as sensitive to pain as\nI would otherwise be. By the time I had planned what I would do, a third\nknock came. Then I mustered up courage and strength enough to say, \"What is\nit?\" \"Lady\", came a voice. \"did you ring for a pitcher of water?\" \"No,\" I fairly\nshouted, \"I did not,\" I hope I shall never pass thru an experience\nlike that again. It is said that it is possible for a human being to have certain\nfeelings only once in a life time. If the feelings are of the harrowing,\npainful variety, that dispensation of Providence is a great blessing, indeed.\nOnce when I was filling engagements in Florida I had a\nanother experience, which \nproved against how unreliable are railroad schedules in some parts of the South\nI was told that the train for which I had bought my ticket would carry me thru\nto Miami and I would arrive that night. As evening came over the conductor came to\ntell me that the schedule had been changed and that I would have to remain over\nnight at a small place which was a winter resort for Northerners.and take a\ntrain for Miami the next day at noon. I had been riding all day in the first \nclass coach and had met some interesting people from Chicago who were en route\nto this resort. They had spent several winters there and were delighted with \nit on general principles. When one of the women who had been especially interested\nin me learned that I had to remain over night at this resort, she immediately\ninsisted That I should put up at her hotel- a small, exclusive hostelry\nfordiscriminating guests. My newly-made acquaintance stated with pride\nthat nobody but people highly recommended could secure accommodations at his\nlittle inn.

When Paul urges men\nto have the mind that was in Christ, he portrays the self-surrender\nof the man Jesus, obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.\nJesus was always laying down his life for others. \"If any man will \ncome after me, let him take up his cross every day.\" The church is\nright in making the cross the symbol of the Christian faith.\nBrotherly Service\nHere then we stand in the presence of the soul of Jesus. He is\nbrotherly, helpful, self-denying. His spirit is in the spirit of fraternity,\nservice and loving sacrifice. If a man have not this same\nspirit he is none of his. If a church is not baptised into this same\nspirit it does not belong to him. If you roll brotherliness, service,\nand sacrifice into one word, you have love. The spirit of Jesus is\nthe spirit of Love. \"God is love,\" and Jesus is the express image of\nhis Father, and is therefore love. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of \nthe Father and also of the Son, and therefore the Holy Spirit is the\nspirit of love. The kingdom of God is the sway of love. If the world\nis full of suspicion, and fear, and ill will, the kingdom of God has\nnot come. If the church abounds in unbrotherliness and selfishness\nand dissention the kingdom of God has not come. All Christians are\nexpected to pray constantly that the sway of love may come. It must\ncome first of all to those who offer the prayer. The sway of love\nmust be first in the church. If it is not there it is not likely to\nbe anywhere. It cannot be there until Christians repent and are born\nfrom above. Christ is inexorable on this point. \"A new commandment\nI give unto you that ye love one another as I have loved you.\" Men\nare always willing to love up to a certain point and after a conventional\nstandard. We become real Christians only in loving our fellow\nChristians as Christ has loved us. This is his type of love which\nwill save the situation. There must be the generous, forgiving, overflowing,\nreckless love of Christ. We must forgive our enemies, and\ndo good to them that despitefully use us. It is this Christlike\ntype of love in Christian men which is to convince the world that\nJesus is from Heaven. Such love is the only badge of discipleship,\nthe only satisfactory proof of loyalty. It is the only orthodoxy\nrecognized in heaven. \"By this shall all men know that ye are my \ndisciples if ye have love one for another.\" A loveless church is not\na Christian church. A church which does not serve humanity does not\nbelong to Christ. A divided church is a stumbling block and scandal.\nA church made up of groups of men  who are unbrotherly, and who hold\naloof from mutual service and who refuse to cooperate in loving sacrifice\nfor the attainment of common ends is a church which is a disappointment\nto the heart of Christ. The nations will never be won\nby the observance of sacraments. The world can only be won by the\nmassed cohorts of Christians who love one another as Christ has loved\nthem. If the church have not the spirit of Christ it is none of his.\nUntil that axiomatic truth is faced, and accepted, and incarnated,\nwe must remain outside the city whose gates are pearl.\n\"If a man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his.\" Let\nus put a fresh emphasis on that. If he does not have the mind of\nChrist he is contributing nothing to that public opinion which will\nsome day control the world. If he does not have the heart of Christ\nhe does not count in the sum total of redemptive forces.\nIf the church has not the spirit of Christ it is none of his.\nLet us stress that.

Slowe\nPresident\n\n4\nIn the January number of the North American Review 1904 Thomas Nelson Page had an article on Lynching which was one of the most scurrious attacks upon the colored men of the United States which has ever appeared in print. It was full of misleading statements from beginning to end. When I read it, I thought I could not survive, if something were not done to correct the false impression that Mr. Page's article had made. I wrote to Mr. Munroe the editor of the North American Review, a Scotchman, and told him I thought it was unworthy a great magazine like his to kick a group that was already down by showing one side of a story which represented them as brutes without allowing the other side to be shown. I urged him to have some outstanding man like  Booker T. Washington or Dr. Dubois to write the story of lynching from a colored man's point of view, so that the truth would be told. I wish I had all the money I spent on postage stamps in sending such letters to Mr. Munro. After writing at intervals for several months without receiving a reply I finally wrote to William Dean Howells and asked him if he could not induce the editor of the North American Review to allow the other side of the story to be shown. Almost by return mail  I received a letter from Mr. Howells, saying that he agreed with me perfectly, and while he was simply a contributor to the Harper publications and had no great amount of influence he would do what he could to have the colored man's side presented.\n   Shortly after that I received a letter from Mr. Munro saying that he would like to have me write the article I had suggested, that he did not want me to consider I had been commissioned by him to write it, and that if he decided to publish it, he would and if he didn't, he wouldn't. I wrote the article which was one of the easiest tasks in that line that I ever attempted. I had been keeping a scrapbook for several year and all I had to do was to turn it in and find concrete examples showing Mr. Page's statements that innocent negroes had never been lynched and that the Negro was practically the only rapist in the United States, were absolutely false. This article was in the 1904 June number of the Review published without a change of a \"the\" or an \"and\"! I received a copy of the Review sent me by my husband while I was in Berlin Germany, where I had gone to deliver an address before the International Council of Women on the progress of Colored Women.\n   When I returned from Europe I went to call on Mr. Munro in New york and outlined another article which I wanted to write for the North American", "32", 69, 69, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-001:00586", "Sunday   May  16\nRead the Life of James &\nLucretia Mott and delivered\nMy Appreciation of Lucretia\nMott to Berto who said it\nwas the best thing I ever\ndid.

He declared that \"as the years \npass, these women are becoming increasingly alive to their opportunity to \ntake a large and important part in the management and control of the country's \naffairs, to enforce recognition, change and improvement in their own \nparticular problems and those which interest them; and to become a distinct \npower in deciding all questions of vital concern to every citizen regardless \nof sex.\" And then the candidate for President nominated recently said emphatically \nthat from the first the Republican party has welcomed and encouraged this development and \nhas given women substantial recognition in its councils. It believes in, \nand practices, the principle of full equality between men and women.\" And \nthen Senator Curtis mentioned the [various] important positions of honor, power and trust in the various departments of government to which women have been appointed. \n   It is truly a fine record and the Republican party has a right to feel \nthat it has acted quite handsomely toward white women. But what about the \nrecognition accorded to another group of women who are not white? What has \nbeen done for them? Echo can only answer WHAT? Not only have no rich, juicy \npolitical plums fallen into their basket, but in some parts of this country \nthese women are not allowed to vote. Under the headlines \"Our Women Are Not \nAllowed to Register\" one of our newspapers reported conditions in Virginia \nduring the Harding Coolidge campaign as follows: \"It is not at all creditable \nto the Solid South, dominated by our white fellow citizens that they have \ndeemed it wise and for the best to throw all of the obstacles they can in the \nway of Afro-American women qualifying to vote, when they apply to do so, the \nsame as women of other race groups. It is a reflection upon the spirit of \nfairness and justice which our white fellow expect of others in all matters \nwhere their rights and interests are concerned. The treatment to which these women where subjected, when they tried to exercise \ntheir right of citizenship was outrageous.

If history teaches one \nlesson more than another it is that races wax and wane.  The conqueror may \ndominate the vanquished for a while, but he is himself conquered in the \nend.  God's children who appear a bit backward to day are developing their \npowers slowly, perhaps, but they are developing them just the same and \nthey will reach the zenith of their power and glory at the appointed time. \nThe white man's \"done been whar he's gwine,\" while his dark-skinned brother \n\"is on his way.\"\n   \nThose who are interested in the non-white races, (and surely all of us \nare,) are wishing the Chinese well in their effort to unite so strong\nand fast which will unite all sections into one strong government. \nNow that the Nationalists have won the civil war and are trying to\nbring the whole country under one flag, they are being strongly, viciously \nopposed by Japan.  It certainly is a great pity that these two people are \nfighting each other, when one of them is trying to take its place among \nthe great powers of the earth, after having been divided into warring \ngroups so long.   Japan dares Manchuria to unite with the Nationalist government and threatens to give China trouble if this union takes place. \nBut, since Great Britain, the United States and several other nations have decided to recognize \nthe Nationalist government, it is not probable that Japan will attempt \nto prevent Manchuria from uniting with it by force.  Those strong\nnations have also agreed to allow China to look after her tariff herself,\nso that she will have a much greater revenue than she as ever had before.\nThe old treaties which were so unjust to China have been terminated\nso that within a few months she will have money enough to increase her army\nand make any preparations to defy Japan which she considers necessary.\n\nSurely Japan will not be so stupid as to start anything rough with\nChina, now that the Nationalist government has the support and sympathy of\npractically all the great powers of the world.  Japan has heard spokesmen \nfor both the United States and Great Britain declare that they consider\n\n3\n\nthat the number of old-fashioned homes which meant that each family had a separate dwelling\nto itself,  should be decreasing for any reason whatsoever.  For a long\ntime experts who study the tendency of the times have been declaring that the\nhome as it was fifty years ago is becoming rarer and rarer every day, particularly\nin the cities.  Writers who used to paint a beautiful picture of the home\nwith the members of the family sitting around the dining room table, the parents\nreading, while the children studied their lessons, can no longer do so now,\nunless they draw on their imagination.  There are one hundred things to attract\npeople-, old and young- from their homes to day, where there was only one a few\nyears ago.  Let us hope, however, that the old fashioned home as it once existed\nwill not become altogether extinct.\n\nSpeaking of homes reminds me that a well-known official in a big real estate\ncorporation recently advised people to make every possible sacrifice to buy a home.\nHe told them not to hesitate to go in debt to acquire a home, assuring those\nwho do so that if they really want to own one,  things generally work out right\nin the long run.  It is amazing, he says, the way payments will be taken care\nof and the mortgages reduced as the seasons go by.  Just as soon as a man has\na steady job, he says and enough money to make a down payment, he should begin\nto look for a home.  The rest can be easily arranged by paying a certain\nsum each month, while one lives in his newly-acquired residence.  According\nto his opinion the following are a few important reasons why one should own\nhis own home:\n\"1.  Home ownership gives stability in a business way, for credit is more often\nextended to a home-owner than to a renter.\n\"2.  Your ability to care for your family is best evidenced in the possession\nof a home.\n\"3.  If you have a sudden call for capital or are in dire distress, money usually\ncan be realized if you have a home to pledge as security.\n\"4.

C., ____, 190\n\nif he would secure a respectful hearing among intelligent people.\n\nWe are face to face with the new woman--not so much as an essenti\ntially new creation--but with the true woman, better understood--develop-\ned to a proud consciousness of life's important duties, and of the respon-\nsibilities that fall to her lot. Woman has emerged by a slow but steady\nprocess of evolution from actual slavery, to a point where she can demand\nand procure equality of opportunity with man, individual independence, and\nmental comradeship in its best sense. It is with woman in this new light \nthat the twentieth century must deal. In every department of activity she\nmust be reckoned with, and blind and unreasoning is he who refuses to grap\nthe significance of this improved order of creation. While the sexes, in\nthe nature of things, will not loose sight of their mutual interdependence\nthe modern idea certainly leads toward the intellectual freedom and the\nfullest development of individual capacity in each. The choice of pursuit\nwill hereafter rest upon environment, taste, and ability, rather than upon\nmere sex. Woman is making her way into business, into the professions and\ntrades, with marvellous rapidity and cleverness, and her hand is reaching \nfarther and farther into the domain of politics and statecraft. We believ\nthe signs of the times point to a brighter era because of this fact. The\nwise woman, however, is facing the problem of her place in life bravely\nand calmly, and is diligently working out her salvation, without forgetting\nthe delicate refinements and tender sympathies which tradition--and man--\ninsist shall hedge about her station. it is fitting rtherefore, that the \nSecond Baptist Lyceum take a beautiful day like this, to study woman's wor\nwork, and to take up perhaps the most widely discussed phase of the problm\nnamely that matter of suffrage for the female sex. Many of us have preju-\ndices and opinions that may not be justified by the evidence. Let us have\nlight, before passing our final verdict.\n\nThe country is fortunate in having within its borders so many represn\ntatives of the highest type of Afro-American womanhood, and their presence\nis a hopeful augury for the future of the race and lays a foundation for\nthe most optimistic predictions. Without invidious comparison, I am con-\nsyrained to the belief that ewe can boast of no woman who has brought to\nus more sincere recommendations from the leaders of thought, and who em-\nbodies more of the lofty qualities that make for happiness, progress, and\npersonal purity than the speaker of today--Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, of \nthe United States of America. As an educator, she stands in the front ranks\nAs a member of society, her influence has been and is healthful, inspiring,\nand enobling. As a wife, she is sympathetic and morally strengthing.

They are going out for the vo\nof the women with sleeves rolled up and fire in their eye.  In the two cam-\npaigns which have passed since suffrage was conferred upon women only 35\n40% voted.  They are following in the footsteps of their indifferent broth\ners instead of setting ? citizenship.  But this is to be\nchanged this year.  In\nIn New England more women are entitled to cast their ballets than men.\nThe same condition obtains in the middle Atlantic section, it is said.\nAnd the gentlemen who need votes are out to get them all.

It is impossible to go into lengthy details. If further information is desired it can be secured upon inquiry at the office.\nThe total attendance during the Four Day Mission is estimated at about 60,000, including all meetings addressed by the Missioners. There were about 125 appointments of all kinds for the various speakers;  handling these required practically the full time of one man for two weeks and part time for a longer period. So far as we know, not a single engagement was missed. The attendance of ministers was about 1400; at the Seminars over 1200; at the women's meetings about 3700; at the youth meetings about 3300. Almost 300 persons served as members of the Committee of One Hundred or in some other capacity. More than 3000 promotional letters were mailed, together with about 1200 post cards. Hundreds of pieces of literature were enclosed in these letters. More than 7500 hymn books were used. 65,000 programs were printed and distributed and about 15,000 posters of various kinds.\nFour One Day Missions were held in advance of our meetings; 8 cities were visited during our session, with 11 meetings held in them. 4 luncheons were held, with a total attendance of about 1300. 8 radio addresses were given, 3 of them by members of our local committee in advance. 15 colleges, universities and high school were addressed. The number of separate meetings was about 110.\nThe very finest cooperation was given by numerous allied organizations, as well as by most of the Protestant pastors and churches of the city and the immediately surrounding territory. Our most grateful thanks are due to a multitude of interested friends throughout this entire area who cheerfully gave us very valuable assistance.\nOn the whole, the meetings were exceptionally uplifting and inspiring. Their fine spiritual influence has reached into hundreds of churches and other organizations. Probably no other series of meetings has ever affected the religious life of our people so deeply or profoundly. Reports that are reaching us from pastors in many churches are exceedingly encouraging both as to present results and prospects for the future. Probably about 100 Eight Day Missions have been held since the close of the Four Day Mission. Others are being planned after the holidays.\nWe are happy to be able to report that the receipts from all sources were considerably in excess of the expenditures. See the figures in the accompanying financial statement. As the amount of work required was so great and the items involved were so numerous, the expenses were naturally large; but they were justified by the results achieved. Five additional persons had to be employed at various times during the rush of the final month, as the small staff of the Federation was quite unable to handle the tremendous additional load. Our stenographer gave almost her entire time for an extended period to the Mission. By agreement with Dr. Bader, her salary for three months ($240.00) is included in the Federation's expense item. Both the Executive Secretary and the Office Secretary spent much of their time on this work also, commencing about a year ago. That was essential to the success of the enterprise, as was likewise the vast amount of volunteer service given by so many people.\nWe are all very thankful for the favorable issue of the Mission in so many ways and for the spirit of devotion and generosity with made possible this encouraging outcome, under the blessing of God. Our churches should now plan to conserve the spiritual results in every way possible and press on to greater activity in the fields of evangelism and Christian social service in the year ahead. Let us all \"thank God and take courage\" as we face the future.\nDec. 22, 1936\nC. C. Rasmussen, Chairman\nW. L.

We fight Russia.  We fight China.  We win or lose or stalemate.\nIf we win, what can we do with 150 million Russians and 450 million Chinese?  What\nwould we know in their case more than we knew in Germany or Japan?  What would convert \nthem to our way of life except their eventual belief in it?  And is not belief,\nfact and reason--and not guns--our real recourse?\nWhat hinders us from beginning to reason now before we fight?  Why are we afraid\nto reason and wait and pursuade?  We are afraid.  For we stop logical thinking. We \ninvent witchwords.  If in 1850 an American disliked slavery, the word exorcism\nwas \"abolitionist\".  He was a \"nigger lover\".  He believed in free love and murder\nof kind slave masters.  He ought to be lynched and mobbed.  Today the word is \"communist\".  \nNever mind its meaning in a man's mind.  If anybody questions the power of\nwealth, wants to build more TVA's, advocates civil rights for Negroes, he is a communist,\na revolutionist, a scoundrel, and is liable to lose his job or land in jail.\nAnd yet there is not today in this nation an honest progressive citizen who does not\nshare in his beliefs many of the basic ideas of communism. \nI am a fellow-traveler with communists in so far as they believe the great\nideals of socialism as laid down by the world's great thinkers since the 17th century.\nI believe in the abolition of poverty.  I believe in curbing the social and\npolitical power of wealth.  I believe in planned industry and more just distribution\nof wealth.  There is in this body of belief nothing revolutionary, unless human progress \nis revolutionary.  There is nothing which has not been advocated by the best\nthinkers of three centuries.\nBut what we are being taught to believe today is that Russian communism is not\nsocialism, but something dishonest, misled and essentially evil,--while our capitalist\nsystem alone is light and truth.  Calling names does not settle this controversy.\nWe call Russia an authoritarian state.  So are we.  All states are and must be slave\nstates.  They differ in degree of control over citizens and progressive states look\nforward to a decrease of state control and increase of individual freedom.  But \nRussia starting with 90% of illiteracy in 1917 could not start as a free democracy.\nOnly educated people can rule successfully.  Russia showed her faith in democracy\nby promptly decreasing her illiteracy to less than 10 per cent in 30 years.  We showed\nour belief in slavery by taking 86 years to reduce Negro illiteracy to 30 per cent.\nWe rage at planned economy.  But we have planned economy.  It grows and sells\nour crops.  It sets our wages and fixes our prices.  It tells us what to manufacture\nand when.  But democracy has no part in it.  Our planning is done by our plantation\nsystem; by the great trusts of steel, tin and aluminum; by General Motors and the\nDu Pont empire and Standard Oil; by railroads with their fraudulent bonded debt and\nwatered stock; by Wall Street.  This planning is strictly in private hands until it\nbreaks down.  Then trust and railroad, bank and big farm come to the government for\nrelief.  That is not socialism, it is patriotism.\nLet us balance in a reasonable way the case of Russia and the United States.\nRussia has never attacked us.  We not only have invaded Russia, but allowed our country \nto become the center of the most far-reaching verbal attacks on Russia.  We are\nmaking the United States a refuge for every ousted landlord and exploiter, spy and\ninformer who hates Russia.  We blame Russia for joining Germany in 1940.  But we know\nthat she did this only after the United States and Great Britain had refused her offers\nof alliance and she must join Germany or stand alone.  When Germany turned and\ntreacherously attacked Russia, we awaited her annihilation with equanimity.  When,\nto our surprise, Russia beat Hitler, we welcomed her help but took our own good time\nbefore easing her desperate struggle in the east by a western offensive.  We sought\nher alliance against Japan and courted her at Yalta because we did not dream Japan\nwas so near collapse.  And even then we yielded no more than Russia was able to take.\nShe kept faith with us in every promise at a greater cost than any other country paid.\nYet we peremptorily ended her absolutely essential land-lease and since 1945 have\napparently sought every excuse to make war upon her.\n\n- 4\nWhy do we want war with Russia and who leads this demand?  We profess to want\nto protect western Europe against Russia.  But it is western Europe which since 1917\nhas almost continuously attacked Russia.  It was western Europe and the United States\nwho after World War I seized countries long recognized as Russian and organized border \nnations like Poland for the expressed and declared purpose of using them eventually \nfor conquering Russia.  It was not imperialist expansion which let Russia to\nre-annex the Baltic states and to secure by every means the close alliance of Poland\nand the Balkans.\nThe real reason for war on Russia is not her natural effort to protect her own\nborders but her effort to establish a socialistic state.  Our country is ruled by\nincorporated wealth, incorporated so as to form a non-human person, protected by the\nFourteenth Amendment, secure in organization and ownership of property and able to\nescape major taxation by hiring the best legal talent of the land.  This wealth is\nforcing us into war.  The people of the country do not want war.  You do not want\nwar.  But somebody does want war, somebody with power and influence, who owns the\npress and controls radio, cinema and theatre.  Somebody whose consequent ability to\nto form public opinion has forced this nation into hysteria and fear.\nWho is this somebody?  It is the group which control the corporate wealth of\nthis land.  They have made money out of war.  They are making money out of the fear\nof war.  They demand a third world war to ward off the depression which threatens\ntheir business and their wild waste of public taxation.  The enemy of this power is\nthe plan of Russia to found a state where this power of wealth will be curbed and\ndestroyed.  It is not a question as to whether or not Russia can do this, as to\nwhether or not the present Russian state is or is not succeeding.  It is the determination\nto compel citizens to believe this can never be done and that any attempt\nto curb the anarchy of rule by wealth is of itself a crime to be suppressed and not\neven discussed.\nGentlemen, make no mistake.  Russia and Communism are not your enemies.  Your\nenemy, ruthless and implacable, is the soulless and utterly selfish corporate wealth,\norganized for profit and willing to kill your sons in order to retain its present\nabsolute power.  It is not our sympathy for the Balkans that is leading us to war.\nWhat did we care about the Balkans so long as western capital was making 75 per cent\nprofit our of oil and slaves?  We kowtowed to czars and splendid grand dukes so long\nas they held power.  But when Russia drove out idle nobility and foreign exploitation\nand tried to build a state for the consumer and not the investor, then the\nworld which lives on low wage and monopolized land and resources began to scream", "23", 71, 71, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-028:00126", "- 5\nthat this plan was impossible and criminal and must be stopped by force. But why?\nIf Communism cannot be made to work, it will fall of its own overweight. But it may\nsucceed, and to stop any such chance you are asked to hurl the world into war.\n\nThe cost will be horrible. If we force Europe to a military race for arms her\neffort to recover will by nullified. Another way, even if victorious, will ruin\nGreat Britain and France. And its eventual cost by increased taxation will throw\nthe laboring classes of all the Americas into hopeless turmoil and despair. This is\nwhy we are calling next month a Continental Peace Congress in Mexico.\n\nThe hope of America, the hope of the world, is no more war. We have the cure\nfor disagreement and mistake in the United Nations. Once we forced the League of\nNations on an unwilling world. Then we refused because of petty internal politics\nto support our own child. It failed, and war and depression resulted. We planned\na United Nations, including our own provision for unanimity without which we would\nnot join. Now when we cannot have our way in everything, we are ready again to\nsabotage our own handiwork and substitute war for persuasion.\n\nIf you vote these billions, never believe that war will never start without\nyour consent. If there had been such an appropriation two years ago, we would have\nbeen at war now by an unexplained \"mistake\". We began the Mexican War before Congress\ndeclared war. We fought Spain after she had yielded every point Congress demanded.\nWe can easily be in a Third World War before you hear of it, when the military\nhas this blank check.\n\nSocialism, whether accomplished by communism or reformed capitalism or both, is\nthe natural and inevitable end of the modern world and grows out of the industrial\nrevolution as fruit out of the seed. It is spreading in every civilized land today\nincluding the United States. To try stopping it by red-baiting and hysterics is\nstupid. To turn back the clock by war is a crime.\n\n######", "24", 69, 69, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-001:00623", "Sunday   Aug  8\nTook a long walk and went up\nthe mountain by a new road.\nHurt my ankle a little bit.\nRead several stories in Everybody's \nMagazine, one of them a\nrace story.

His \nelection marks the date of the beginning of the nation's brilliant \nprogress. At last the day had dawned, when the much flaunted misnomer \n\"the land of the free\" was called to an accounting. \n\nWhen the extension of slavery was put to the test, it was found \nthat the seven original articles of the Constitution, supplemented by the \nfirst ten amendments thereto, generally known as the bill of rights, were \nnot sufficient unto themselves to guarantee stable government; as government \nwherein the people were part slave and part free, could never endure \nanywhere, much less under yon starry emblem as revitalized by the \nRepublican Party and which waves to the breeze to day the symbol of the \nguarantee that \"no human being can stand beneath its folds without \nbecoming, and without remaining free.\"\n\nWherere on soil the foot of bondmen trod, there, no other men \nof toil were free. So it was, in the Southland, before the Negro was\nfreed. The white people who toiled with their hands, plantation mechanics,\ncarpenters, blacksmiths, brick layers as well as laborers, were in direct \ncompetition with the slaves. The daily wage of the white employe was \n\n8\n\nmeasured by the cost of dong a day's work with slave labor. Such working \nwhite people, by this economic condition, were reduced to abject poverty and \nwere known as the poor white trash of the Southern slave states. Insofar as \nlivelihood was concerned, the whites were worse off than slaves. The master \nhad a proprietary interest in the slaves. Their value in dollars was\nmeasured by their capacity for work. Therefore, the selfish interest of the  \nmaster prompted him to nurture his slaves. Hence, he furnished them shelter, \nfood and clothing and the other actual necessaries of life. Whereas, the white \nlaborers seeking employment must accept for their day's pay the ruling cost \nof slave labor or not work at all, and, even though they were willing to \nwork at the rate of wage thus established, they were unable to secure steady \nemployment. This system reduced white labor to poverty and their children \nwere brought up in total ignorance. Books or schools seldom ever \nfell to their lot. \n\nOne of the prime reasons for the opposition to the extension of \nslavery to the Northwest Territories was to prevent any possibility of \ncreating a condition among white working people of the North, similar \nto the so-called poor white trash light of the slave states. \n\nWith this history before us, it is easy to see that the Negroes \nin bondage who had no control over their own acts, not fixing their own wage \nscale, were stifling white labor, constantly grinding, grinding and \ngrinding down toiling white people, until it was considered beneath \nthe dignity of white people better circumstanced to have any social or \npolitical relations with them. So to speak, they were ostracized by all \nhuman kind. It was to prevent such degradation of white labor in the \nNorth that moved large numbers of men to oppose the extension of slavery.\n\nInspired by Abraham Lincoln, the Republican Party rounded out \nthe unfinished work of the framers of the Constitution. \n\nIt emblazoned upon the pages of that sublime charter, the \narticles that made all men who live within the scope of its authority", "33", 71, 71, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-028:00140", "16\n\nIn its platform of 1856, the Democratic Party declared, \"The \ntime as come for the people of the Untied States to declare themselves \nin favor of free seas and progressive free trade throughout the world\n......\" It has stood steadfast to the free trade doctrine \nunto this day. \n\nUnder the Democratic free trade policy, when rails were needed \nto construct railroads, they were bought in Europe. When cars, passenger \nor freight, were needed, they were bought in Europe. Almost every sort \nof manufactured article was bought in Europe. Our money was shipped to \nEurope to pay the labor to produce the products sold in the United \nStates of America. At the same time, our labor walked the streets \nseeking employment. \n\nUnder the Democratic tariff policy, American mills and \nfactories could not compete with European products owing to the low\nwage scale of Europe. Therefore, it is plain to be seen that \nmanufacturing industry was not encouraged by the government (what was \ncontrolled at that time by the Democratic Party) and for that reason \nwas not promoted. \n\nWhen the Republican Protective tariff law was enacted, mills \nand factories were established; employment was given to those heretofore \nunemployed, industries flourished over the land. Instead of \nsending money abroad to buy rails for railroads and other necessities, \nthey were made in our mills. American labor did the work and \nreceived in pay for their labor, money that had hitherto been shipped  \nto Europe. \n\nGradually, year by year, under the benign influence of \nprotective tariff, new industries were developed, until the day came \nwhen we produced all the necessities of life. This development \nchanged the whole economic condition for our people. It reached \n\n17\n\ninto every family of the nation. It increased the income of the employees \nin every branch of employment, from a mere pittance to a point where it has \nbeen sufficient to educate, with rare exceptions, the sons and daughters \nof the toiling masses. Whereas, prior thereto, their children were deprived \nof the advantages of education, as even in tender years, they must \nwork if they would live. Under the legal system of that time, the children \nof the poor, as soon as they were able to work, were apprenticed for a \nterm of years. They received in pay their keep and lodging. In some cases \nthey were taught to read, but seldom to write. Usually they were apprenticed \nto farmers. \n\nThis industrial development also increased the income of the \nnational and local governments which made possible free schools in \nsuperabundance, through which the sons and daughters of the most humble \nparentage are now the intellectual equals of the sons and daughters of \nthe most affluent families, thus elevating Americans to the very \nhighest degree of culture known to civilization and made them the \nmost prosperous in the annals of people. As a natural \nsequence, it produced a new and distinct civilization for the records \nof man.  \n\nOf all the new openings of endeavor growing out of this \ndevelopment of industry and free schools, the most beneficent was \nthe new field afforded to women. Owing to their natural efficient \nadaptability to secretarial, accounting, office management and scores \nof other important posts of light employment, they are employed in \nthese fields by the millions. Their income greatly adds to the well \nbeing and comforts of the family. In many cases, it is through this \nmeans that other members of the family are educated. It should not \nbe forgotten that this grew out of the industrial development due to \nRepublican Protective Tariff.", "38", 71, 71, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-028:00142", "20\n\nland was owned by the Government, it was subdivided into sections of\n640 acres each.

The remaining equal number of 640 acre trusts were\nretained by the Government and were allotted to settlers under the\nHomestead Law.\n\nBy furnishing settlers plots of 160 acres of land, under the \nHomestead Act along the line of railroads, what was once a wilderness\nhas now grown to be one of the most prosperous agricultural, and in\nsome locations industrial, parts of the country.

If a wet is nominated \nat Houston, as now seems possible, what are Democrats to do? \nFor one, I do not want to vote the Republication ticket, nor do I wish \nto remain away from the polls. There seems no way out but to organize \na new party. I find many leaders are in sympathy with this program \nbut, of course, they cannot say anything publicly until after the \nConvention. I also find many Progressive Republicans who are of like \nmind. They oppose Hoover because he is not in sympathy with farm relief, \nis not any too dry, and remained in the Harding Cabinet without protest \nagainst his fellow members, Fall and Daugherty.\n\n\n\n3  \ndid so with their tongues in their cheek. They winked at each other with \nan understanding nod, I am sure. They could not possibly have suppressed a \nsmile, when they put themselves on record as revering the Constitution \nand revering the law. Some of them must have laughed out loud when they \nheard men in that group pledge themselves to repudiate the brazen attempt \nto commit the party (Democratic) to a policy of nullifying the Constitution. \nTo quote George Rothwell Brown , the brilliant, broad-minded paragrapher \nof the Washington Post, \"The only lessons in nullification that this \ncountry has ever learned have been taught by the wet-drinking, dry-voting \nSouth that is forcing prohibition on the North through votes in Congress \nbased on a disfranchised Negro population.

Because scientists believe that in \nAfrica may be found the source of race and language expeditions are constantly \ngoing into the dark continent to study the proof of this theory. In a \nbook written several years ago the author advanced the idea that there is \nlittle doubt that Africa exerted a distinct influence upon this continent \nlong before Columbus discovered America.

And if one bloody conflict is more horrible and shok\nshocking than another, it is when brothers close together in deadly em[bra]brace\nwith their hands at each other's throats. The war was waged solely\nto preserve the Union, it is said. Indeed the great Liberator himself emphasized\nthat when, when he replied to Horace Greely, who had criticized his\naction relative to the question of slavery\nin an editorial of the New York Trubune. \"If I could save the Union\nwithout freeing any slave, I would do it\"; said Abraham Lincoln. \"and if \nI could do it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could do\nit by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What\nI do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps\nto save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe\nit would help to save the Union.\" But the same great and good man, whose\nbirthday we commemmorate to night declared just as emphatically on another\noccasion that the rebels who were fighting to destroy the Union were\nstriving to prove that this government was [founded] built upon the foundation\nof human slavery rather than upon the foundation of human rights.\nWithout slavery, he said in one of his messages, \"the rebellion could\nnever hav e existed; without slavery, it could not continue.\"\nA little more than forty years ago there were 4 millions of bondmen in the\nUnited States, men, women and children, groaning under a yoke too bitter\nand too galling to be described. And that, too, as monstrous and incredible\nas it will appear to future generations in a country which owes its\nvery existence to the unconquerable love of liberty in the human heart.\n\n     The man during whose administration the bloody civil strife commenced\nwas no god of war from whose nostrils the smoke and flame of battle\nflashed, but he loved peace as dearly as loved his life. If it had been\npossible [?] and tender heart to secure an\n\n\n\n2\npossible for Abraham Lincoln with his warm and tender heart to secure an\nhonorable peace and thus avert the awful throes through which his beloved\ncountry passed by giving his own life, he would gladly have sacrificed\nhimself, I am sure.

The complexion of the\nnatives who owned and occupied Australia is dark\nalmost black. Most of them have been exterminated. Only a few of the natives are left.\nEngland first became interested in Aus because \nshe sent her murderers and thieves there. Australia \nby the way is just a bit smaller about 3,000,000 sq. miles in size than the \nUS. She has now a population of 7,000,000.\nHer neighbors, she says, excluding New Zealand aggregate \nover 1,100,000 colored persons, more than half the population \nof the world. Over 1,000,000 sq miles are in the tropics,\n     The descendents of the original settlers from\nGreat Britain have enacted stringent laws prohibiting\ncolored people from living in Australia which\na dark race once owned and inhabited. It has\nbeen difficult for colored people from the U.S\nto get a visa even to permit them to travel\nthru Australia.\n     But now white Australia is badly scared because\nthe Japanese a colored race threaten to invade\nthe continent. Australia therefore has called\nloudly on the US for help. [And the] US has so sent a goodly\nnumber of colored soldiers from the US to save white Australia\nfrom invasion by a colored race. And the newspapers tell[s] Australia \nwas glad to give [the] our colored soldier boys from the\nU.S a cordial welcome. This is a queer world my\nmasters.\nThis very minute England is holding in subjection", "6", 74, 74, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-021:00122", "7\nallay the fears of the North, Mr. Lincoln promised to send the colored \nfreedman to Hayti, or to Liberia or to the Spanish American colonies, in \nfact, he promised to send them anywhere and everywhere but to his Satanic \nMajesty below. But neither compensation nor colonization, single or \ncombined satisfied the South. Every suggrstion which Mr. Lincoln or any \nother patriot made was received with ridicule or scorn.\nLet us alone, just let us alone, demanded the slaveholders. All we want is to be let alone. And [this demand was] the North acceded to this deman until the territory of the slaveholder was so enlarged and the peculiar institution had so encroached \nupon free soil, that the most sanguine became alarmed and the most ardent \nadvocates of peace and expediency cried stop.\nBut why, you, ask, do you give us such an extended review of ancient \nhistory which every school boy knows by heart? The reason is not far to \nseek nor the answer hard to find. It is becasue history is repeating itself, \nmy friends. It is because there are thousands upon thousands of colored \npeople in this country to day, who are but little better off than \nwere the slaves fifty years ago. Under the regime of the Convict Lease \nSystem, that new form of slavery, which in some respects is more cruel \nand more crushing than the old, hundreds of colored people, young and \nold, men and women are thrown into dark, damp, disease breeding cells, \nwhose cubic contents are less than those of a good sized grave. There \nare hundreds of these convicts who are overworked, underfed and only partially \ncovered with vermin-infested rags. Under the old regime of slavery \nthe death of a slave meant an actual loss of dollars and cents.  It was to \nthe master's interest, therefore, to clothe and shelter and feed him \nproperly, so as to preserve his health as long as he could. Under the \nConvict Lease System, as it is operated in the majority of southern State \nto day,  the death of a convict involves no loss whatsoever, either to \nthe company who rents the convicts or to the State  Many of the convicts \nare thrown into the stockades upon trumped up charges and have committed\n\n\n\n8\nno crime at all. And yet, if a vigorous crusade against this diabolical\ninstitution were [institued] charted, [the section] those who continue to persecute the race\nwhich is simply continuing its\npersecution of the race [which it once enslaved] which their ancestors enslaved, would insist as did their\nslaveholding fathers before them that they be let alone In States in which [would call]\ncrimes against colored people are committed with impunity.\nHeaven to witness that they would reisist to the death any interference with\n[its] their sovereign rights. As though any section or part of this great Republic\nhad the right to commit a continuous wrong.\n[*Slavery*] Colored men are supposed to be free to day, and yet by a notorious\ndisenfranchisement acts which have been adopted by nearly every State in th\nSouth, the freemen of 1905 have no more rights of citizenship no more thn\ndid the slaves whom Abraham Lincoln liberated forty years ago. Almost evey\nchild knows that the present political power of the South which makes\none white man of that section equal to seven in the North is derived from\nthousands of Colored men from the right of citizenship has been violently\ntorn. And yet, if one dares to call attention to those illegal political\npractices, he is accused of waving the bloody shirt, or of stirring\nup sectional strife, than which nothing could be more criminal. Public\nwrath is no longer turned against the sinner, but against him, who calls\nthe sinner to account. Moreover, the South can poke all manner of fun at\nthe North, makes faces at it and call it very naught names, and it would\nnever occur to anybody but an inmate of an asylum for lunatics or imbeciles\nto even suggest that the South was stirring up sectional strife.\nBut let anybody be brazen and bold enough [that] to declare that the fundamental\nlaw of the land should be respected and the right of citizenship\nbe withheld from no one on account of race and color; that the shooting\nand burning alive of men and women whose only crime in many instances\nis the color of their skin and the so called best citizens of the section in which lawlessness so generally prevails, shake their fists at the North, ringleaders become hysterical at\nonce [and] grow red in the face [as they insist their rights are being attacked]\ndeclare they will not be interfered with and warn the country\nbe left alone.

It was especially difficult to get \none for France. The State Department refused to give passports to \nthe 30 delegates and alternates to the Peace Congress, as originally \nplanned, and reduce the number to 15. Under the circumstances it \nwould have been very easy to leave the colored delegate out. There \nwere many women who had been deeply interested in the peace movement \nwho had contributed literally to the cause and were financially able \nto go. For that reason I felt a signal honor had been conferred upon \nme by the Peace Party, when my name was retained as a delegate.\n\nI had worked for the War Camp Community Service till the last \nminute and I had only a few days in which to prepare for the voyage \nafter I reached home from New York. Having secured my passport in \nWashington, I had to have ample time for the visas in New York. \nSome of the visa work had to be done at least 72 hours before \nsailing. But the fates were very kind to me and I went through the mill \nin two days. \n\nI was fortunate also in securing a fine, large stateroom in \nwhich there was only one other passenger, a young woman born in \nHolland whose parents had grown rich in Java, one of the Dutch \nPossessions. With a party consisting of Miss Jane Addams, Miss Jeannette \n-354-\nRankin, the first woman to be elected to the Congress of the \nUnited States, Dr. Alice Hamilton, the first woman who was ever \ninvited to lecture at the Harvard School of Medicine and others we sailed \nfrom New York on the Noordam, Holland-America line, April 9, 1919, \nalmost five months to the day after the armistice was signed. All of us \nsat at the Captain's table and received as much attention as is good \nfor any human being. Every morning we worked hard in Miss Addams' \nroom trying to decide on the resolutions which should be presented to the Congress and in what language they should be couched. \nThe necessity of typewriting these resolutions became very apparent - But \nwhere was a typewriter to be found? Nobody could answer that question \nAnd who could type them if haply we could locate a machine? I guaranteed \nto get a typewriter and type the resolutions, confessing that \nI had never taken a prize as an expert typist and had little hope \nof reaching that stage of proficiency. \n\nThe purser cheerfully consented to lend me his machine a short \nwhile each morning, and I used it.

We remained \nin Paris several weeks and paid a pretty penny for the rooms we \noccupied.

Then I quickly left the room. I must confess I should not like to describe the emotions which surged within me, when I left Captain Platt.\n\nThe following day I saw Captain Boutte', a colored officer stationed in the Visitors' Bureau, who spoke French fluently, and he told me I would hear definitely the next day whether I could take the trip or not. Since Captain Platt had stated positively that I could not go, I was very much surprised to learn that there was even a remote possibility that this decision would be reverse. The stern captain evidently relented, for the trip was arranged and Captain Boutte' was designated as my guide. Thus it was, that I was the devastated sections of France, the terrible destruction of the villages and towns, the miles upon miles of the wicked barbed wire with which the fields had been interlaced and the beautiful, age-old structures which had been shot to pieces. It was pathetic, but heartening, to see the wonderful industry and the fixed, grim determination of the French who had already started to repair the awful destruction which had been wrought.\n\nThose who saw the Argonne Forest right after the world War must have been impressed with the fact that the Germans felt absolutely certain they would win it. They had converted it into a regular town with cemented houses, some of them prettily decorated. There was a grand stand in which the soldiers could listen to band concerts and a regular tiled bath room for a Royal Highness. The little spades and pewter spoons left by the Germans were still to be seen lying here and there on the ground where the owners left them, and I took the trouble to bring several of them home with me.\n\n-370-\n\nIn the Argonne forest I plucked a piece of ivy which grew near the grave of an American soldier and although I carried it about with me a long time for many miles from pillar to post,  several pieces of it survived, so that in two places I have living things to remind me constantly of France--a French ivy vine which climbs up the front wall of my resident in Washington and one which clings to the front of my summer home near Annapolis on the Chesapeake Bay, where the Naval Academy is located.\n\nI was glad I had struggled against the exhibition of race prejudice shown by my countrymen in France and finally had an opportunity to see for myself what it would have been a tragedy for me to miss and to gain invaluable information which I could have received in no other way.

The French\npeasants relied on mass; and tore out the\nhearts of their tyrants with bare hands,\nand decapitated them with rusty scythes.\nThe Russians invented a method all their\nown; unable to stand before the frightful\nweapons of today, too poor to buy them,\nthey have relied on secret associations, terrorism,\nand the bomb; armed with which\none man can disrupt a regiment and wreck\na palace; and easily and cheaply made at\nthe price of a good dinner.\n\nCheerfully ignoring the teaching of the\npast, the South goes on its way driving\nthe Negro into the corner of despair.\n\n\"The Clansman\" (which, we are told,\nhad been as popular in Springfield before\nthe uprising as was the \"Marriage de Figaro\"\nin Paris before the Terror) shouts\n\nforth its evil councils; forcible deportation\nof the Negro is advocated; theatres, libraries\nand decent seats in cars and even\nchurches are not for him; but all these trials\nare far from driving him into despair.\n\nSo long as he can live, receive an honest\nwage, obtain from the law protection from\nsudden and cruel death on mere suspicion,\nhis good nature and patience can be relied\non; his somewhat indolent disposition needs\na strong spur to rouse him, as a race, to\nrevolt; but can any fair minded student\ndoubt for a moment that if the South generally\nwere to adopt the teaching of Springfield,\nthe Negro will respond to the natural\nlaw of the cornered rat, the starved peasant\nwith nothing more to lose, and make of\nthe pleasant South a hell unspeakable?\n\nWill he alone prove a world exception,\nor will he move in lines as easily demonstrable\nas a mathematical problem?\n\nWe see Negroes lynched, burned, tortured\nfor misdemeanors; for barroom fights;\nfor theft. What then is left for really serious\ncrimes?\n\nIn Mediaeval days, when scores of felonies\nwere punishable with death, many of\nthem with torture, crime was never so\nprevalent. Robbery was almost invariably\naccompanied by murder; because the punishment\nwas in most cases death, and it\nwas prudent to destroy the victim lest he\nbear witness.\n\nAll sense of right and wrong was clouded\nand confused by the frightful severity of\npenalties applied indiscriminately to monstrous\ncrimes.\n\nIf the South fails to read her problem\naright, if she permits lynching and torture\nto prevail to the debauching of her youth\nand the desperation of her blacks, her\nblood will be on her own head. As surely\nas she sows cruelty, she shall reap horror.\n\nEither lynching must die out, or vastly\nincrease.", "68", 78, 78, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-022:00496", "-3-\n\nSocial agencies solve this problem for him in a vast majority of instances. But they can only function if they receive funds through The Community Chest. So, when there are more people presenting their problems to the agencies, the need for the help and for the money to finance it is great, not less, than in the past.\n\nWHAT ABOUT TAXES\nTaxes are up. But that is no adequate reason - not even a good alibi - for not supporting The Community Chest:  (1) The increased taxes are not for use in Washington and a good citizen cannot penalize his own city because of other demands. (2) Much of the Chest money is to prevent distress - epidemics - delinquency, and it is far less expensive to give today for prevention than to pay tomorrow for the results of neglect.

Fortified\nby Roosevelt's repeated declarations and\nassurances that the United States desires\nnone of the territory of its American neighbors\nand meditates no disturbances of their\nautonomies, but seeks only that these\nAmerican governments be stable and orderly,\nobserving their just obligations, M.

In the beginning let me assure that there is  no bitterness in\nmy heart toward white people.  The best friends I have ever had , some of\nthe best friends I have today are white people.  Whenever I stand before\na audience like this I cannot help thinking of the great debt of gratitude\nthe Colored people of this country owe their friends in the North. For as\nAmerican slavery was one of the blackest chapters in the history of the\nhuman race, so the consecration of many of America's noblest sons and\ndaughters upon the altary of duty in the name of the newly freed slaves\nwas one of the sublimest records which could possibly be found. If ever\na portion of a nation atoned more fully and handsomely than did those who\nlived in the North to a race which had been cruelly held in bondage by\ntheir brothers in the South, I have never heard of it. If ever people\nput forth more conscientious and effective efforts than did those who lived\nin the North, first to emancipate, and then to educate and finally to\nelevate a race which had practically been reduced to the level of brutes,\nI do not know it.  For years after Lee's surrender to Grant, there went\nforth out of the North from comfortable homes and loving friends an ever\nincreasing band of men and women who cheerfully consecrated their lives\n\n4\nto the work of enlightening and uplifting the emancipated slaves.  No crusader\nof old ever went forth to recover the holy land from the Musselmans\nwith more heroism and zeal than that displayed by the northern patriots\nand philanthropists who for years journed South to deliver the minds of\nthe newly freed slaves from the darkness of ignorance and the blight of\nsuperstition in which they had been held for nearly 300 years. Many who\ndid not give themselves to the cause gave freely of their money instead.\nMore than one of these northern evangels of light went forth to a martyrdom\nas real and as cruel as that suffered by Stephen of old.\nWhen she thinks of the herculean efforts which have been put forth in the\nColored man's behalf, it is but natural that he should pause to inquire\nwhether the recipient of as many and as great favors has proved himself\nworthy of them or not. As a beneficiary does the Colored man pass muster or\ndoes he fail?\nReview the Colored man's record in any field of human endeavor you may,\nsince the emancipation proclmation  set him free.  See the brilliant success\nsince he has achieved as a student in the best universities of the land. Examine\nhis record in finance and trade, so far as he has been able to go, recall\nthe many proofs he has given of the highest, purest patriotism, beheld on\nexamples\nall sides of irreproachable citizenship unto which thousands of Colored\npeople haveattained and surely no honest person will claim that the means\nexpended and the sacrifices made in the Colored man's behalf have all\nbeen in vain.  For forty years the Colored man has been inching along like\nthe poor onch work, as the Jubilee song expresses it, hoping finally to\nmake himself worthy of the respect and consideration of that race, whose\ngood opinion and good wishes he so earnestly desires.  At the close of the\nwar the Colored man who could read was the exception and not the rule.\nAnd those who had been taught had received instruction in defiance of the\nlaw.

But in order to get more closely at the facts, let us for \na second institute a comparison between the intellectual progress made \nby the Colored people of this country, the majority of whom live in the \nSouth and that made by the white people of the section. And for fear that some one may think I am biassed and partisan, let the owrds of a southern journal be used.  In lamenting the sluggishness and the mental backwardness \nof the white people of that section a few years ago the Atlanta Constitution, one of the largest journals in the South expressed itself as follow \n\"There are as many illiterate white men over twenty one years of age in \nthe South to day as there were fifty years ago, when the census of 185o \nwas taken.  When thinks of the rapidity and extent with which Colored people\nhave reduced their illiteracy, it is difficult to see how any one with \nthe intelligence which Mr. Thomas Nelson Page claims to possess can so glibly and loudly prattle about their mental inferiority, as he does in \na magazine of recent date. But whenever I read Mr. Pages disquisitions on the Colored man, I do not worry much over his slanders, because I console myself with the thought that there are none so blind as those who wont see.  If the Colored people of the South had shown such lack of aspiration and had made such little progress as the Atlanta Constitution declares has \nbeen made by the illy conditioned of a highly civilized race/ Mr. Thomas Nelson Page and the other philosophers of his ilk would make the air heavy with his prophecies of evil and their pronounciamentes to prove from stalistice \nand awful examples hos innately inferior is the Colored man and \nhow hopeless his case.  Inspite of Mr. Page's loud and lugubrious protestations \nof the Colored man's mental inferiority, there are to day in this \ncountry at least 2,000 Colored men practicing medicine and as many are engaged \nin the law.  There are 32,000 Colored teachers in our public school. \nThere are 140,000 farms and homes owned by the Colored people of this country,\n\n6\nwhose value is estimated to be $750,000,000, while their personal \nproperty amounts to 140,000,000 at least.  $12,000,000 worth of school property is owned by the Colored people of this country, while $40,000,000\nis owned by the Church.  In various parts of the country there are \nwell established banks which do not fail and flourishing stores, and commercial \nenterprises ov various kinds owned and operated by Colored people.  \nThe production of cotton which is largely the work of the Colored man's hand, has greatly increased since the close of the war.  It would seem, therefore, that the Colored man's progress along all lines would \namyliy \nmeasure up to the demands of his most exacting critic and full the expectations \nof this most sanguine friends.\nUnder what circumstances has this marvellous progress been made? At every\nstep of his journey toward knowledge and affluence he has found huge \nobstacles towering in his path.  Obstacles which it has required great physical\nstrength and indomitable courage to remove.  In a large section of \nthis country he has been the victim, not only of lawlessness, but also of \nlaw.  For those whom the lyncher mercifully spares are deprived of their ci citizenship in the courts.  In nearly every State of this union it would \nbe as easy for a camel with a hump to pass literally thru a cambric needle's \neye as it would be for a man or a woman through whose veins one \nsingle drop of African blood was known to flow to secure any one of innumerable positions opened to everybody but to the individual whose epidermis \nis dark.  And where, pray ar the men and the women who but a few years ago \nso courageously championed the Colored man's cause?  Echo can only answer where.  For some reason which I myself can not explain the tide of public \nopinion has been steadily setting against the Colored man for the last 20 \nyears.  Those who were once known to be the Colored man's best friend and \nwho boasted openly of that fact have almost nothing to say in his favor or \nto his credit now.  If you ask them why they consern themselves so little", "16", 80, 80, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-021:00257", "about the Colored man's present condition \nis in almost impossible for them to answer the question satisfactorily \nto themselves. I have heard many of the back sliders cheerfully admit\nthat the progress made by Colored people along all lines has even transcended the expectations of his most sanguine friends. But the fact remains \nthat the interest once manifested in the Colored men by the North \nis growing beautifully less. It is reaching the vanishing point as fast as\nit can.\nIndeed the attitude of the North toward the Colored man reminds me very \nmuch of a story I once heard about the humorist Bill Nye. It is the fashion \nnowadays to put prize fighters on the stage. For instance John L. Sullivan \nwas a famous drawing card among the footlight favorites of a few years \nago. In a revival of Harriet Beecher Stowe's great book a few years ago \nit was quite natural that Peter Jackson, the famous pugilist should have \nbeen asked to take the role of Uncle Tom. It happened once upon a time \nthat Bill Nye was booked to deliver a lecture in a little town out West \nthe same night on which Uncle Tom's Cabin was to be played. But the audience \nwhich greeted the humorist was so small that he excused himself and \nhe and everybody else went over to hear Peter Jackson talk about the pearly \ngates to little Eva. After the play was over, a friend met Bill Nye in the\nlobby, \"Hello Bill\", said he, \"what do you think of Peter Jackson?\"\n\"Well\", replied the humorist dryly, \"anatomically he was great but Uncle \nTomically he was just the worst I ever saw.\" And so, I fear that some of \nformer friends in the North have back slidden so far that they feel, theoretically \nat a distance, many years ago the Colored was all right but \nthat practically at the present time face to face, he is just about the \nworst they ever saw.\n\"That is the way of the Negro\", I fancy I hear somebody say, \"He is always \ncomplaining about something and is never satisfied. This country has \ndone enough for the Negro. Let him shift for himself now.\"\nIn Titus Andronicus Shakespeare tells a pitiful story of a beautiful\n\n\n\n8\nyoung maid whose hands were cut off and whose tongue was cut out. After \nthe miscreants had maimed her thus, they taunted her, saying \"Go tell who \ncut out thy tongue and if thry stumps will let thee play the scribe, write \ndown thy mind.\" I sometimes thing the Colored men's condition in this \ncountry at the present time is quite similar to the predicament of this\nunfortunate maid. Withe ear of the public deaf to his appeal for justice, \ndeaf to his appeal to be given an equal chance along with other men, was \nnot a cruel public opinion practically cut out his tongue? And if the pres\nin reflecting public opinion and catering to public taste is quite naturally \naverse to making its columns a vehicle thru which the Negro may express \nhis woes and wrongs, what good does it do him, if he does play the scribe \nand write down his mind. The cowardly deference to public opinion has \npractically cut off the Negro's hands. And if the colored man tries to \nsecure employment, after he has mastered a trade and is coldly rebuffed at \nalmost every door, has not this same cruel public opinion practically cut \noff his hands?\nNext to the Colored person who is trying to arouse the conscience of the\ncountry to the fearful wrongs endured by his race, probably the most unpopular \nperson at the present time is the occasional white men who insists \nupon pleading his dark brother's cause. The similarity between the attitude \nof the public mind on the race question today and that on the question of \nslavery before the war. There are now as there were then hundreds of men \nwhose very souls cry out against injustice to the helpless and weak, but \nso unpopular has it become to array them before the public and arraign \nthose who instigate and perpetrate them that only those who have the blood \nof the martyr flowing thru their veins have the courage to attack them. \nAt the close of the war, if an abolitionist or a union soldier had been \ntold that much of the work which it cost millions of treasure and rivers \nof blood to accomplish would be practically undone in every state in the", "17", 81, 81, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00253", "[*St Clare's Hospital\n415W 51st\nNew York*]\n\nSaturday May 18th [*1946*]\n\nDearest Mother,\nWith the type of examination you\n[you] had the results should be perfect\nGuess I would have been carried on a \nstretcher.

Only national \norganizations were invited to participate. \n\nIn the 1894 November issue of the Woman's Era the \nfollowing notice appeared:\n\n\"The National Council of Women, which convenes in \nWashington, D.

The departments of the \nmagazine were conducted by the following women: Mrs. \nVictoria Earle Matthews, of New York; Mrs. Fannie \nBarrier Williams, Chicago; Mrs. Josephine Silone Yates, \nKansas City; Mrs. Elizabeth P. Ensley, Denver; Alice \nRuth Moore, New Orleans (later Mrs. Paul Lawrence \nDunbar); Mary Church Terrell, Washington. The \nwriter of this article is the only woman among those \nwhose names appear on the above editorial board who \nis living. \n\nAbout this time something happened which caused the \ncolored women of the country to meet to consider what \nshould be done about a foul slander hurled against them. \nIn a letter dated March 6, 1895, James W. Jacks, president \nof the Missouri Press Association, sent a scurrilous \nattack on colored women to Miss Florence Belgarnie, of \nLondon, Honorable Secretary of the Anti-Lynching Society \nof England, and a well-known friend of the race. \nIn this letter Jacks declared that the Negroes of this\ncountry were wholly devoid of morality, the women were \nprostitutes and all were natural thieves and liars. Miss \nBelgarnie forwarded this letter to the editors of the \nWoman's Era for publication. It was not published in \nthe Era, however, but it was printed and sent to leading \n\n[*36*]\n\nmen and women, particularly to those in the South, for \nan expression of opinion. \n\nOn the editorial page of the June, 1895, issue of the\nWoman's Era, in an article entitled \"Let Us Confer Together,\"\nthe following notice appears: \"We, the women\nof the Woman's Era Club of Boston, send forth a call \nto our sisters all over the country, members of all clubs, \nsocieties, associations and circles to take immediate \naction, looking towards the sending of delegates to this\nconvention. Boston has been selected as a meeting place \nbecause it has seemed to be the general opinion that here, \nand here only, can be found the atmosphere which would \nbest interpret and represent us, our position, our needs \nand our aims. One of the pressing needs of our cause is \nthe education of the public mind to a just appreciation \nof us, and only here can we gain the attention upon which \nso much depends. \n\n\"It is designed to hold the convention three days, the \nfirst of which will be given up to business, the second and \nthird to the consideration of vital questions concerning \nour moral, mental, physical and financial growth and \nwell-being, these to be presented through addresses by \nrepresentative women. \n\n\"Although this matter of a convention has been talked \nover for some time, the subject has been precipitated by a \nletter to England, written by a southern editor, and reflecting \nupon the moral character of all colored women. \nThis letter is too indecent for publication, but a copy of \nit is sent with this call to all the women's bodies throughout \nthe country. Read this document carefully and \ndiscriminatingly and decide if it be not time for us to \nstand before the world and declare ourselves and our     \nprinciples. The time is short, but everything is ripe; and \nremember, earnest women can do anything. A circular \nletter will be sent you in the meantime. Let us hear at \nonce for you.\"\n\nAs a result of this call, what is designated as \"The \nFirst National Conference of Colored Women of America\" \nwas held in Boston, Massachusetts. It opened its \nsession on Monday, July 20, 1895. Mrs. Josephine \nPierre Ruffin called the meeting to order at 10 A.M.\nDistinguished people spoke; representative women read \npapers; the convention went into secret session to discuss \nJack's letter; resolutions were passed, and finally, \nthe convention discussed forming a national organization. \n\nMrs. Helen Cook, president of the National Colored \nWomen's League, was present and, according to the Era's \nAugust, 1895, report of the meeting, \"Mrs. Cook was \nallowed time to make the necessary explanations regarding \nthe National League.\" It was \"proposed that a \nnational organization be now formed, with its own laws, \nofficers, constitution, etc.\" This motion prevailed, and a \ncommittee on organization, consisting of one delegate \n\n[*THE AFRAMERICAN*]\n\nfrom each delegation, was appointed. A discussion followed \nas to the clause looking to a union with the Colored \nWomen's National League. A committee was appointed \nto perfect the organization. Names of the candidates \nfor whom the delegates should vote for offices, \nwere given to the convention. It was voted \"to frame the \nconstitution, that the Women's Era be made the organ \nof the national organization,\" and \"that the name of the \nnew organization be laid over.\" It was also voted that \n\"the officers and Executive Board of the National organization\nshould confer with the officers and Executive \nBoard of the Colored Women's National League \nfor the purpose of effecting a union.\" The meeting was \nadjourned \"subject to the call of the Pres., Mrs. B. T. \nWashington.\" The names of the other officers who were \nelected at that meeting were not given in this report. \n\nIn this \"the first National Conference of the Colored \nWomen of America,\" said the 1895 October issue of the \nWoman's Era, \"for the first time in American history, \ncould be seen an audience of several hundred women, in \ndress, manners and general public appearance, fully up \nto the average presentation of a similar assembly of their \nsisters in white.\"\n\nIn this same issues there was a \"CALL TO THE NATIONAL \nFEDERATION OF AFRO-AMERICAN \nWOMEN, organized in Boston, Mass., July 31, 1895,\"\nthe President, Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Tuskegee, \nAla. In an editorial, reference was made to the fact \nthat many were disappointed because the President of \nthe Woman's Era Club, who called the meeting, had not \nbeen elected president. It was also stated that \"the convention \nunanimously voted that from this delegate body \na national organization be formed looking to a union \nwith the Woman's League of Washington, which in order \nto meet an emergency and grasp an opportunity to \nmake a creditable showing for themselves, their race, and \nthe cause they were invited to represent, had been obliged \nto call themselves 'national,' to be eligible to membership \nin the Council held in Washington in March last. \nThis action had been taken hurriedly and nothing but \npraise is due the Washington League for rising to the \nopportunity and using any measure to make the most of \nit. The convention held in July was the first one ever \nheld by our women, and as most of the states and territories\nwere represented, either by delegates or letters, can \nhonestly be termed national in its scope and the only \nlegitimate source from which a national organization \ncould spring.\"\n\nThe members of the League were greatly shocked, \nthat their organization had been accused of calling itself\nnational before it had actually acquired nationality and \nan unfortunate misunderstanding between the two groups \nensued. The article which appeared in Ringwood's \nAfro-American Journal of Fashion in the May-June  \nissue of 1893 had stated that the Kansas City Club with \na membership of 150 women had joined the League and \n\n[*SUMMER AND FALL, 1940*]\n\nthat other clubs had united with it but the league had \nnever held a convention. There is no doubt whatever \nthat the Women's Era Club of Boston has the distinction \nof calling together the first national convention of \ncolored women in the United States. Shortly after that \nthe Colored Woman's Congress met in Atlanta, brought \ntogether many progressive women and gave an additional \nimpetus to the woman's movement. \n\nIn the 1896 May issue of the Era it was stated that the \n\"National Federation of Afro-American Women had \ntaken every step consistent with dignity and self respect \nto effect a union with the Woman's League,\" but that a \ndefinite reply which had been promised by the League \nhad not been forthcoming. One of the Federation officers \nwent to Washington, May 1st, she reports, and was \ninformed that in its issue of April 25th, the Colored    \nAmerican announced that the League would hold a convention \nin Washington in July. It was then decided \nthat the National Federation of Afro-American women \nwould hold a convention there also \"on account of the \ncut rates to that city for the month of July.\"\n\nAnd so it happened that on July 14th, 15th, and 16th, \n1896, the First Annual Convention of the National \nLeague of Colored Women was held at the Fifteenth \nStreet Presbyterian Church, and what was called the \nSecond Annual Convention of the National Federation \nof Afro-American Women was held in the Nineteenth\nStreet Baptist Church July 20th, 21st and 22nd. It was \nthe consensus of opinion among women of both groups \nthat it would be impossible successfully to maintain two \nnational organizations at that stage of our growth and it \nwas decided to unite them. \n\nOn Monday, July 20, 1896, the first day of the Federation's \nconvention, a committee of seven was appointed \nto confer with a committee of equal number from the \nLeague, with a view to uniting the two organizations. \nThe Federation's committee was composed of Victoria \nEarle Matthews of New York, Selina Butler of Atlanta, \nRosa D. Bowser of Richmond, Josephine Pierre Ruffin \nof Boston, Libbie C. Anthony of Jefferson City, Mo., \nAddie Hunton of Richmond and Mary C. Terrell of \nWashington, D. C.\n\nThe committee from the League consisted of A. V. \nThompkins of Washington, D. C., Coralie Franklin of \nWest Virginia (now Mrs. George Cook), Anna Jones \nof Kansas, Julia F. Jones of Philadelphia, Fannie Jackson \nof Kansas City, Florence A. Barber of Norfolk, Va., \nand E. F. G. Merritt of Washington, D. C. The Joint\nCommittee elected Mary Church Terrell as its chairman. \n\nOn the second day of the convention, July 21st, the \nJoint Committee reported as follows: It is hereby \nstipulated\n\nThat we do consolidate under the name of the National \nAssociation of Colored Women. \n\nThat officers shall be chosen on a basis of equality by \nthe Joint Committee.\n\n[*37*]\n", "6", 83, 83, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-001:00741", "Wednesday,  Jan.  26,  1927\n\nMiss Stetson of Barton Art Studio\ncame to see me this morning\nto advise me with reference to the \ncolors in which my rose wood\nset should be upholstered.\nShe thinks the 2 old [Carolina] Eastman\nchairs (reproduction of those made\nin King Charles I time) in the hall\nshd be upholstered in blue or red\n[damask] reps, the sofa in damask\nwith tan background or blue having \ncolors of the rug.

When I \nquestioned her about it, she would usually say that her master had not only\ntaught her to read and write, but had also given her lessons in French.\nShe enjoyed relating that her wedding trousseau had been bought in New York by\nMiss Laura, her white half-sister, who had gone there on a visit, and that she\nhad been given a nice wedding at which a delicious repast was served her guests.\n\nI can not leave my forbears without saying a word about my dear grandmother\non my mother's side. In complexion she was very dark brown, almost black, with\na straight, shapely nose and a small mouth. In her manner she was quiet, refined\nand reserved, [and] always spoke in a low tone of voice and tried hard to teach her\ngrand daughter to do the same thing. My grandmother was called \"Aunt Liza\" by\neverybody - old and young - and was generally beloved.\n\n15\nShe could tell the most thrilling stories imaginable and I listened\nto her by the hour. Most of all I enjoyed hearing her tell about a \"hoop\" snake\nwhich had seen some children walking through a wood, had decided to give them a \ngood scare for being so far from home alone, had put his tail into his mouth,\nmade a hoop of himself and rolled after them \"jes ez hard ez he could.\" One of \nthe children happened to look back, saw this hoop snake pursuing them and\nwarned the others of their danger. My eyes were as big as saucers and my hair\nstood on end at Grandmother's realistic imitation of the eldest child as he\ncalled out \"Run, chillun, run. The hoop snake's after you. Run for your lives.\"\n\nOccasionally Grandmother told me tales of brutality perpetrated upon\nslaves who belonged to cruel masters, but they affected her so deeply she was\nrarely able to finish what she began. She had a unpleasant experience herself\nit pained me to hear her relate. She was reared in the house and was the house-keeper\nfor \"Ole Miss,\" so she rarely came into contact with the overseer.\nBut one day she went into the field on an errand and the overseer challenged\nher about something. She resented what he said and he threatened to whip her.\n\n\"I dared him to tech me\", she said. \"Then he started toward me raising his\nwhip. I took out an run jes ez fas ez I could, an he after me.

To be sure he used the idioms\ncommon to the South and pronounced certain words as they are often pronounced\neven by educated people of that section. [So far as I can recall] his\nworse offence against English was that he would refer to the \"Fust\"of the\nmonth.\nBegin here\nMy father had business ability of high order. When the yellow fever\nbroke out in 1879, he happened to have some cash on hand which he had saved,He\ninvested every penny of it in real estate in that stricken city which\npractically everybody, the wise as well as the [unwise] foolish, said was doomed.\nPeople were willing to sell valuable property for a song. All they wanted\nto do was to leave Memphis, so that they were [?] willing to sell for a few\nhundred dollars in cash prpoerty worth many thousands. When my father was\nbuying property in the midst of the second epidemic of yellow fever[y] he was some\npeople ridiculed [?] him and said Bob Church was crazy , He was spending every\ncent he had, they said, buying property in a city which had an epidemic of\nyellow fever[y] in 1878 and again the very next year in 1879. There was no\ndoubt, his friends told him, that Memphis was doomed. But my father used his\nbrain and declared that there was no good reason why Memphis should be visited\nby epidemics of yellow fever every year. \"Isn't Memphis called the 'Bluff\nCity', he used to say. That's just what it is. Its built up high on bluff.\n\n8\nThe reason why Memphis has epidemics of yellow fever is because the strets\nare in such a terrible condition. The streets are paved with blocks of wood\nwhich quickly rot. Great pools of stagnant water stand in the streets which\nbreed disease. That's the cause of the yellow fever\", he argued. \"When the\ncity is cleaned up and the streets properly paved, there will be no yellow\nfever in Memphis. It will be one of the most healthful cities in the South.\"\nMy father lived to see this prediction fulfilled to the letter.\nI have gone into detail with reference to this matter to prove how sagacious,\nlogical and far-sighted my father was. [There were] At that time in Memphis there were many men who had graduated\nfrom college, [white men, at that time,] of course, [white men] and who had great\nreputaions for keen business acumen, [who] (because they did not see as far as this unlettered\nrecently emancipated slave), (who lost practically everything they had in a panic.)\nWhen Memphis returned to narmalcy after the epidemic of 1879, my\nfather owned property in some of the most desirable sections of [Memphis] the city.\nAnd that is how [my father acquired] R.R. Church [?] his property and [gained] acquired the reputaion\nof being a rich man.\nIt is a great temptation to say much about my father, for he was a remarkable\nman in many respects. He was by no means a saint. Far different.\nHe had the defects and vices common to men born at that time under similar\nconditions, reared as a slave and environed for so many years as he was from\nnecessity not from choice. Having said that much about that side of his life\nI have conceded enough in the interest of truth. He learned to read by\nconstantly perusing the newspapers, I think. He taught himself to write his\nname legibly- even beautifully, but he never wrote a letter to my knowledge.\nHe always hada[man] secretary or a member of his family write his letters for him, [while I was away at school]\nIn conversing with my father few would have suspected that they were \ntalkingto an uneducated man except for an occasional mistake in grammar and\nthe mispronunciation of a word to which even educated people in the South\nare often addicted.

I had resolved \nafter that experience that in \nthe future when I knew I would be \ntravelling all day, I would not go into \nthe Jim Crow car.) There were so \nmany deeply-tanned, dark, white people \naround that I hoped my swarthy \nface might get by. Anyhow, if I got \ninto trouble I had made up my mind \nto take it. \n\nA short time before reaching Texarkana \nin the early evening, the conductor \ntold me the train would not go\nthrough to Paris that night. \"What \nshall I do?\" I asked. \"I am acquainted \nwith no one in Texarkana. Where \ncan I stay tonight?\"\n\n\"You can stay at a hotel, of course,\"\nthe conductor replied. \n\nUp to that moment, it had never occurred \nto me to attempt to stay at a \nwhite hotel in the South. Without \nthinking, I exclaimed: \"I can't stay \nat a hotel in Texarkana!\"\n\nApparently the conductor did not \nunderstand the meaning of my exclamation \nfor, as the train came to a \nstop, he called a porter and said:\n\"Here, Jim, take his lady to the Rawlings \nHouse. (That is not the name \nof the hotel.) Colored people can always \nrecognize each other, and I wondered \nwhether the porter would take \nme there, but he did. \n\nWhen I registered, the clerk probably \nattributed my swarthy complexion \nto the smoke and dust which had \nblown in through the car window and \nmade me several shades darker than I\nusually am. In my room, I actually \nhesitated over washing my face for \nfear that, when it was clean, I should \nbe \"discovered\" and ejected from the \nhotel. Finally, I washed my face and \ndecided to take another chance: I \nwent to the dining-room. \n\nThe fact that the man and his wife \nat whose table I was seated did not \nrise immediately was reassuring - If \nthey had entertained the slightest suspicion \nthat a monster in the shape of \na real, live, honest-to-goodness colored \nwoman had been placed in such close \nproximity at a table, they would have \ndied the death before they would have \ntamely submitted to such an outrage. \n\nAfter I returned to my room and \nbegan to get settled, I remembered that \nI had written my full name, quite \nlegibly, in the register, and fear took \npossession of me: I had been filling \nengagements in that part of the South \nfor three or four weeks; it was possible \nthat some of the waiters in the \nhotel had read accounts of both my \ncareer and speeches in the colored \nnewspapers. What if they should tell \nthe management? I trembled with apprehension. \nWhat a fatal mistake not \nto have registered under an assumed \nname!  \n\nDrawing about myself what tag-ends \nof comfort I could muster, I \nfinally fell asleep. I was wakened by \na loud noise at the door. \"Your time \nhas come,\" was the first thought that \npopped into my head. I was sure that \nthe clerk or the proprietor had learned \nthat I was colored and had come to \nwreak upon me the vengeance of the \nSouthland for daring to violate its \ntraditions and customs. \n\nI did not answer. \n\nThe second knock sounded louder \nthan the first. I decided I would not \nallow myself to be taken out of that \nroom alive, to be beaten and disfigured, \nor otherwise mistreated by an \ninfuriated mob. I recalled that Texarkana \nwas the first southern city in \nwhich a colored man had been burned \nto death. This thought was no comfort. \n\n My room was on the first floor above \n  \nA COLORED WOMAN TRAVELS THE UNITED STATES \n\n[*301*]\n\nthe main entrance with a window \nwhich reached from the floor to the \nceiling and opened on a little veranda. \nI resolved to throw myself from the \nbalcony. If it did not kill me, I argued, \nit might stun me enough to prevent \nmy being sensitive to pain. \n\nA third knock came. I mustered up \ncourage to answer: \"Who is it?\nWhat do you want?\"\n\n\"Lady,\" came a soft, ingratiating \nvoice, \"did you ring for a pitcher of \nwater?\"\n\n\"No,\" I fairly shouted at him, \"I\ndid not!\"\n\nI hope I shall never pass through \nan experience like that again. It is \nsaid that it is possible for a human \nbeing to have certain feelings only \nonce in a life-time. If the feelings \nare such as overwhelmed me at that \nhotel at Texarkana, that dispensation \nof Providence is indeed a great blessing. \n\nEven in places where a colored \nwoman feels she is least likely to be \nthe victim of race prejudice, she sometimes \ngets a large and bitter dose of it. \nNot long ago a friend went to a New \nYork hotel where we had both stayed. \nThe clerk told her they were no longer \naccommodating colored people. \"Why  \nare you excluding us?\" she asked.\n\n\"Because,\" the clerk replied, \"our \nsouthern patrons don't like it.\"\n\nEver since the War of the Rebellion \nthe effort made by the North - which \nclaims to believe in Democracy - to \nappease the South amounts to a national \ntragedy. Can anybody imagine \na proprietor of a southern hotel deciding \nto accommodate colored people to\nplease his patrons from the North?\n\nNot even in the national capitol can \ncolored people be certain of being able \nto satisfy their hunger and thirst. \nSome time ago the Five-and-Ten Cent \nstores decided to permit colored people \nto stand at a counter to eat a sandwich \nand get a hot or cold drink, but \nthey are still not permitted to sit at a \ncounter and eat a meal. \n\nBefore the Five-and-Ten Cent \nstores allowed colored people to be \nserved standing, a mother who had to \ntake her child to the shopping district \nand was detained longer than she expected, \ncould find no place where she   \ncould get the child as much as a glass \nof milk. \n\nColored women visiting Washington \nlearn that their race is barred from \nmost theatres and moving-picture \nhouses. Year in and year out, thousands \nof colored people in the national \ncapitol walk by theatres and movies \ndisplaying alluring advertisements of \nentertainments which race prejudice \nprevents their seeing. This is a special \nhardship for teachers when historical \npictures are shown from which they \ncould derive so much help for their \nwork. \n\nAs a colored woman travels the \nUnited States, she is encouraged by \nthe strenuous efforts of inter-racial \ngroups, here and there, to promote \nbetter understanding between the two\nraces so that injustices of various \nkinds can be removed and they can\nlive together peacefully. \n\nHowever, race prejudice is so powerful \nin the United States; it is so \nstrongly entrenched all over the country \nthat much work remains to be done. \nIndeed, only a very rash person would \ndare set a precise day when the ugly, \nmonstrous evil will have been eradicated, \nand the relationship between \nthe two groups established on the basis \nof the equality which should prevail in \na nation that calls itself a democracy.  \n  \n   \n    ", "24", 82, 82, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-028:00037", "Your Vote-Before and After Election\nBy Katherine Shryver\n\nTHE right to vote is not yet won.\nIt has to be fought for over and over\nagain.  It is such a powerful right\nthat someone is always trying to take\nit away from the people.\nWhen this country was founded,\nand a friend of ours named Thomas\nJefferson was trying to abolish slavery\nand set up a new kind of government,\nmany people thought that only \nproperty owners should be allowed to\nvote.  It took a long fight to get rid\nof that idea.  The next step was that\nanybody (any free man, that is) who\ncould lay a dollar on the line could\nvote.  And thus suffrage was enormously\nincreased.  Imagine the Daniel\nBoones dropping in out of the \nwilderness and having their say in\npolitics.  It was something new in\nthe world.\nSlowly through the years, the restrictions\non the vote fell away-but\nalways by tremendous effort on\nsomebody's part.  The fight over\neach new state as it came into the\nunion-should it be slave or free?-\nwas a fight over the basic democratic\nright to a voice in government.\nUniversal manhood suffrage had\nfairly well become a fact in this\ncountry after the Civil War.  The\nformer slaves took on this most\nmeaningful of citizenship rights with\ndignity and worthiness.  They put\nsplendid men in office, some former\nslaves who became statesmen who\nwill ultimately have their firm place\nof honor in American history.\nBut reaction could not tolerate\nsuch thorough-going democracy. The\nstruggle to cut down the right ot\nvote, to take it away from this and\nthat group for this and that \"reason,\" \nwent on fiercely.  The 1890's\nin the South saw a determined attempt\nto put a constricting poll tax \nback on the vote.  It was obvious\nthat a money tax in a no-cash economy\n(sharecropper-credit economy)\nwould hit most people.  It did.  The\nDisfranchising Conventions, as they\nare called, heard opponents of the\nplan to impose a poll tax forewarn\nof the dire results of this unfair\nfine.  \"It is claimed to be a way of\ndisfranchising Negroes,\" they said,\n\"But it will disfranchise the great\nmass of white people too.\"\nThe vote fell, from the first year\nthe tax was put on.  It kept on falling\nevery election thereafter, till in\n1940 the South had almost forgotten\nits constitutional right to vote. There\nwas terribly apathy toward voting.\nThe burden of paying the poll tax\nout of a non-existent or tiny cash\nincome, of paying it under the most\ntrying conditions, was too great.\nMost people gave up.  Politicians\nwere in office by grace of tiny handfuls\nof voters-as low as one percent\nof the potential voting population.\nThese politicians were sure of their\njobs.  They were \"re-elected\" term\nafter term.  And, logically, they \nrepresented the tiny groups who put\nthem in office-not the majority of\ntheir people.  By virtue of the rule\nof seniority, they formed in Congress\na hard crust that often stopped\nthe democratic process and kept\ndown the people's interests.\nFranklin Delano Roosevelt made\na mighty effort to get the people of\nthe South to remove from office some\nof those men who formed the hard\ncrust.  Roosevelt's reforms were being\ncrushed by them.  The people\nof the South loved Roosevelt and\nfavored his reforms. But their hands\nwere tied.  They could not march to\nthe ballot box and vote their enemies\nout of office.  Disfranchised by the \npoll tax, they stood by helplessly\nwhile the tiny handful of voters \nrepudiated their great President.  They\nwere not able to give him a helping\nhand.\nBut President Roosevelt saw what \nwas the matter in the South.  He\nknew why the people of the south\ncould not support him at the polls.\nHe did not call the South the Nation's\nnumber one political problem\n-which it was.  He called it the \nNation's number one economic problem,\nwhich it also was as a result of\nits political bondage. Then he struck\nout against the poll tax.  \"I have\nalways been against any tax levied on\nthe right to vote,\" he told a press\nconference.  When Mrs. Roosevelt\nbecame a sponsor of the National\nCommittee to Abolish the Poll Tax,\nshe stood there in her own right and\nalso in the strength of her good husband.\nThe South was dear to both\ntheir hearts.  They loved its people\nand its land.  They wanted it to \nblossom like the rose.\nThey also wanted good things for\nour whole nation, and they understood\nclearly the destructive role\nplayed by the poll taxers in Congress.\nDuring the life of President Roosevelt,\nmany of his dearest dreams\nwere denied.  And after his death, a\npoll-tax dominated Congress worried\nhis program into its grave.  Decent\nhomes for our people, an adequate\nbasic wage, security in old age,\nhealth provisions, jobs for all on a \nbasis of merit-these were scrapped\nin our own country, even as the \nUnited States went forth as a crusader\nin the world to stand for fair\nand free elections in other countries.\nBut Mr Roosevelt's words did not\ngo unheeded in the South.

When I was a Freshman in\nOberlin College in 1880 and '81 my father permitted\nme to accept the invitation to attend Garfield's \ninauguration which was extended to me by Mrs. Josephine\nBruce, wife of Senator B.K. Bruce of Mississippi,\nthe only colored man then in the United States\nSenate.\nAs a friend and I were walking down a Washington\nstreet one day, a short distance ahead of us I saw two\nmen talking to each other.  Instantly and instinctively\nI knew that one of the men who had magnificent,\nmajastic proportions and a distinguished bearing could\nbe none other than the great Frederick Douglass. \nFortunately, my friend was acquainted with him and\nintroduced me to him then and there. And thus began\na friendship which I prize more highly than words\ncan portray because I derived so much inspiration and\npleasure from it as long as Mr. Douglass lived.\nWhile I was a student at Oberlin, my attention was\nfirst attracted to the intermarriage of the races when\nFrederick Douglass married Miss Helen Pitts, a white\nwoman, who lived near his residence in Anacostia, D. C.\nIn the reading room of Ladies Hall, where I lived,\nI read the editorial columns of the newspapers and\nmagazines.  Few if any really approved of intermarriage,\nwhile the majority attacked it bitterly.  After\nreading both sides of the question I was convinced\nthat no sound argument or reason could be produced\nto prove that there is anything inherently wrong in \nthe intermarriage of the races.  A great hue and cry\nwas raised against Frederick Douglass' marriage to\nMiss Pitts because it defied the customs and traditions\nof a country calling itself a Democracy, even though\nreeking with a cruel race prejudice which humiliates,\nhandicaps and harasses millions in a minority group.\nThey are victims of disfranchisement, segregation and\ndiscriminations of various kinds which often make it\nimpossible for them to earn their daily bread.\nAnd yet, the colored people who criticized Frederick\nDouglass because he married a white woman were \ncontinually  clamoring for EQUALITY-ABSOLUTE\nEQUALITY along all lines-equality of opportunity,\nequality in the Courts educational, political and social\nequality, world without end, amen!  But when Frederick\nDouglass, the foremost representative of their\nrace, actually practiced equality by choosing as his\nmate a woman classified as white, these very advocates\nof equality attacked him bitterly and condemned him\n\nNATIONAL NOTES, JANUARY-FEBRUARY, 1947\n\nMrs. Mary Church Terrell\n\nfor practicing the equality which they themselves\npreached long and loud. \nWhen the first World's Fair was held in Chicago in\n1893, a year later than it should have been, to\ncelebrate the 400th anniversary of the discovery of\nAmerica by Columbus, Mr. Douglass was the commissioner\nin charge of the exhibit from Haiti and he employed\nPaul Dunbar to assist him.  Mr. Douglass was accustomed\nto entertain his friends at the Fair by taking\nthem to see the exhibits which he especially like.\nFollowing this custom, he invited me to go with him\none afternoon to take in some of the sights.  As we\nwalked along, either through the grounds or in the\nbuildings, Mr. Douglass was continually halted by\nadmiring people who begged the privilege of shaking\nhands with him.  Great honor was paid to him by people \nof the dominant race.  A mother would stop him\nand say, \"You are Frederick Douglass, aren't you?\"\n\"Please shake hands with my little son (or daughter),\nbecause when he grows up I want him to be able to\nsay that he has shaken hands with the great Frederick\nDouglass.\"\n\"Let's get on the scenic railway,\" suggested Mr.\nDouglass, \"so that we may have a chance to talk a \n7\n", "31", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00519", "432\n\nSouthern Workman \n\nand public improvements. Neither the teacher nor the publisher \nshould ever forget that the children are Indians, that they go home to \nIndian parents at night, or every few weeks, and that they report at\nhome continually what they learn at school. Thus the Indian children \nare to become the teachers and inspirers of their parents. In \nthis way the whole community should be reached. \n\nIt is not greatly so in your community and mine. Our children \nlearn more at home than they do at school. We supplement their \nschool teaching by books and constant instruction. In the Indian \nhouse or cabin, the ignorant mother and father will sit at the feet of \ntheir own child, and we must keep their intellectual and social status \ncontinually in our minds. \n\nWhen it come to the reading books, they too should be written \nfor the Indian schools, by people who are thoroughly familiar with Indian \nhistory and biography, and above all, with the traditions which \nare handed down from father to son, and which white men rarely hear. \nI fancy that the stories told of famous Indians are now so told as to \nkeep alive a certain amount of race pride, and the traditions which \nare handed down from father to son, and which white men rarely hear. \nI fancy that the stories told of famous Indians are now so told as to \nkeep alive a certain amount of race pride, and the traditional hatred \nof the white man. Who will write the stories of Black Hawk, Tecumseh, \nPontiac, Geronimo, Sitting Bull, and scores of other heroes in \nsuch a way as to disarm them and to bring out the nobler qualities, \nand the triumphs of peace as well as war. In American history there \nare numerous episodes well calculated to teach the worth of Indian fair \ndealing, of loyalty, of industry, of public spirit, of education, of tribal \nand national intercourse, etc. Write up the stories of William Penn, \nof Pocahontas, and others calculated to remove prejudice, and establish\na feeling of confidence and good will towards our government and \nourselves. \n\nI am well aware that some of you will not agree with me here. You \nare disposed to think that the children should know as little as possible \nof the Indian history, and that they should cherish no Indian heroes.\nSuch a course I cannot approve. Can you secure a feeling of self-respect \nand self-reliance by giving the Indian boy to understand that you \nhave no respect for his father or grandfather? That you regard them   \nas worthless and too degraded to be worthy of recognition? Does the \ncommandment \"Honor thy father and thy mother\" not apply to Indians?\nCan you expect to cultivate a spirit of loyalty, reverence and \nchivalry in the hearts of Indian youths who are taught to forget and \ndespise their ancestors? There is plenty of good literature touching \nthe finer characteristics of the red man, with which to make up the \nIndian Readers. Think of Charles Sprague, Fenimore Cooper, Harriett \nHunt, Catlin, Longfelllow and others too numerous to mention. \n\nBut I have said enough in reference to the peculiar character of \nIndian text-books. I doubt if beyond our First and Second Readers \nwe have any books suitable for use in an Indian community. Let \nShakespeare and Tennyson and Browning wait for twenty years. My \nrejection of American school-books and courses of study for Indian \n\nWhat Shall be Taught in an Indian School \n\n433\n\nuse is no criticism on the books. Their very high merit for our use \nunfits them for the Indian home. In all matters we must keep well \nwithin the circle of Indian sympathy and approval, and then we must \ngradually enlarge that circle without snapping the cords. It goes \nwithout saying that we must have teachers who are educated Indians\nof originality and judgment, or we must have whites of rare tact and \nskill. Restraint, restraint, and still more restraint must be their \nwatchword. \n\nWhen we come to the manual and industrial features we come to a \nsubject where we have only general principles to guide us. Were I to \nattempt an outline of manual work for either girls or boys in a given \ncommunity, I should wish to spend a year in that community to find \nfirst what manual accomplishments are most highly appreciated and \nuseful, and what may be added with promise of success. The successful \nbusiness of an Indian community may take a variety of forms besides \nthose of providing food and shelter, which must of course stand \nfirst. But every self-supporting community must export something \nto balance the imports which it needs and cannot produce. The \nstrong point of a community may be agriculture, or stock-raising, or       \nfish culture, or poultry, or some peculiar manufacture. \n\nIn my judgment the government should send an expert to every \nreservation to study the peculiar conditions which surround the community, \nand point out an industry which may be successfully inaugurated\nthere; then the educational forces should combine to establish \nand promote it. I was glad to hear that Miss Reel proposed to introduce \nthe cultivation of grasses and reeds suitable for basket-making, \nwith a view to promoting that industry among certain tribes. I was \nglad also to learn that Dr. Frissell is preparing some Oneida boys, who \nhave been with him three years, for practical work in a creamery \nwhich has been established on their reservation, so that they may \nbe fitted for positions of leadership among their own people. \nWhatever the strong point is, or promises to be, must be squarely \nand directly recognized in the industrial training. No such general \nculture over several wide fields of universal industry, as is given    \nin the St. Luis Manual Training School, would be at all appropriate \nfor Indian youth. Of course the theory and use of the tools in common \nuse should be taught, with the added points of method and precision, \nand all upon the materials at hand. Household furniture; plain \nhouses and barns and shelters; fences and gates; culverts and wooden \nbridges; the wood-work of wagons and carts, the wood-work of agricultural \nimplements; the making of boats and canoes :-such work \nshould be within the reach of a young man properly trained in an Indian \ncommunity, i. e., one or more lines of such work, and the shop \nwork of an Indian school of boys from fourteen to twenty years of age \nshould be planned accordingly.

Williams \n80th Congress, 1st Session, in Review \n\nThe legislation considered by this Congress can be \ngrouped as domestic, international, military and \ngeneral. We are especially interested in all aspects \nof domestic legislation. \n\nEnacted \n\nForemost is the Taft-Hartley Labor-Management \nact which I discussed at some length in the last \nNEWS LETTER. It is a law now, but it will soon be \ntested in the courts of the land. Other legislation \nincludes the Portal-to-Portal Pay Bill which, though \npassed, limits jurisdiction of courts in future claims \nand nullifies most past claims. Social security pay \ntaxes are frozen at 1 per cent until 1950. Rent controls \nare continued to March 1, 1948, with 15 per cent \nvoluntary rent boost allowed. Also, along the housing \nvein, was a $400,000,000 increase in the maximum \ninsurance the National Housing Authority may issue\non mortgages of new homes. \n\nVeterans working on farms were authorized on-\nthe-job training under the GI Bill of Rights. A permanent \nArmy and Navy Nurse Corps as part of the \nregular services; and a Woman's Medical Specialists \nCorps in the Army were established.  \n \nVital Legislation Not Enacted\n\n1. Tax reduction (passed by Congress but vetoed).\n2. The Taft-Ellender-Wagner long-range housing\nprogram 3. Broadening the coverage of Social Security\nto farm labor and others. 4. Creation of a \nPermanent Fair Employment Practices Commission. \n5. Federal aid to education. 6. Compulsory health insurance. \n7. Increasing the minimum wage. These \nwill reappear in the 2nd session of the 80th Congress, \nand all voters should let it be known that they want \nthis social legislation passed. \n\nTHEY WANT YOUR HAT \n\nSome people have a penchant for conceiving and \nplanning the unusual. One among them is our soror \nin Gary, Indiana, Mrs. Inez Brewer. \n\nFaced with the need for a money raising method to \naid the Gary Metropolitan Council (NCNW) of \nwhich she is president, Soror Brewer sent out a call \nto all sorors and their friends to aid her in the presentation \nof a Benefit Hat Show. \n\nThe plea is for a lovely hat from your personal\ncollection, one that can be displayed as a snatch from \nyour prized possessions.

Got something to \nsay? Can you come right to the point and say it\nwith a punch? If that's the case, there's good news \nfor you.\n\nNow is the time for people in our group to tell the\nworld what's on their minds. That was not always\nthe case. Not so many years ago the average publisher \nwas by no means interested in manuscripts \nwhich colored writers brought to present their point \nof view. If the manuscript was well written by an \nauthor who had something interesting to say, an \nhonest publisher might ease his conscience by telling \nthe writer, \"I'm not denying that you've done a good\njob all right in presenting your facts, but we just \ncan't publish it because it's too controversial.\"\n\nIn those degenerate days both the publishers of \nbooks and the editors of magazines and newspapers \nreally overworked the word \"Controversial.\" But \nnow, Ye Prospective Authors, all that has been \nchanged. Be of good cheer. If anybody tells you \n\"the good day is coming,\" tell that prophet he is \nmistaken, that the good day for you is not COMING, \nit has already come. For a long time publishers have    \nbeen printing books written by colored authors. \nWhat was once rejected by publishers because it was \nconsidered controversial is now accepted with open \narms.  \n\nThis about face has come, not because publishers \nhave been converted, and are now playing the role \nof saints, but because they know the public is intensely \ninterested in books about colored people, \ngood, bad, or indifferent, whether they rebel against \nthe conditions under which they are forced to love \nor take it lying down. So great has been the interest \nin books about colored people of the USA which the \npublic has manifested that some of the best writers \nin the dominant race have shown plainly that they \nare unwilling to let this subject be monopolized exclusively \nby colored authors and for a long time they \nhave been writing about it themselves. A list of some \nof the best sellers which have appeared during the \nlast few years would be sure to include books about\ncolored people which have been written by white authors. \nSinclair Lewis had no sooner put \"Kingsblood \nRoyal\" on the market a short time ago than Kathleen \nCrawford, a Virginian, launched her \"Straw\nFire\" which has just appeared. This novel tells the \nstory of a Southern girl who rejects the traditions \nand customs of the South, and horrifies her family \nby presiding at an interracial meeting. This book is \nfull of dilemmas which constantly face those who try \nto be fair with all races. A comparatively short time \nago such a novel would have been rejected by the \nmajority of publishers because it would have been \nconsidered too controversial. \n\nAnd so it is clear that manuscripts are no longer \nrejected by publishers because of the opinions on the \nRace Problem they present or because of the delineation \nof the character and conduct of individuals in \nthe group, no matter how outstanding, queer or questionable \nthey may be. If those in our group who want  \nto be authors can write correctly, clearly, and cogently \nthey stand a good chance to succeed. \n\n[*1 Soror Terrell, writer of the Delta Creed, and other short articles\nfor select magazines, is a noted author, lecturer, and educator. her \nautobiography, \"A Colored Woman in a White World,\" was top reading \nin 1940.

Many do not know that those \nof us who live in Washington are disfranchised. But we are as helpless as infants,\nwhen it comes to having anything to say as to how we are to be governed.\nBut maybe Washington will have a fling at the polls, before many\nyears roll over their heads, if the efforts which are being made now succed.\nTwo important meetings have been held here recently/ A special\ncommittee of the National Council of the State Legislatures promised to make a \nfavorable report to the parent body which means that this National Countil\nwill undoubtedly endorse it.  Representative Dyer of Missouri ( that great\nman who is the father of the Anti-Lynching vill) introduced the bill to\nin the House of Representatives\ngive the vote to the citizene of the District of Columbia, the first day\nCongress met.  Senator Jones of Washington introduced this bill in the Senate.\nThen these bills will be referred to the Judiciary Committee in the\nHouse and in the Senate.\nIn order to do as much as they can to further the good cause, the\nNational Council of State Legislatures are going with the District delegates\nbefore the Committee to urge them to support the measure. The people of this\ncity are greatly encouraged over the matter, because assurances have been \ngiven then that sentiment in the House of Representatives has never been\nstronger for their enfranchisement then it is to day.\nTwo well-known newspaper correspondents have promised to broadcast the\nplight in which the citizens of the National Capital find themselves as often as they can during\nthe next eight or ten months.  These men declare that people living in the \nStates know nothing about the woes of the \"politically disemboweled\" Washingtonians.\nThe most thoughtful people in the city are convinced that the\nrelations between the District of Columbia and the Federal government can\nnever be properly adjusted until they are represented in Congress. That body\ndoes not understand the situation and conditions here for that reason are abnormal.\nAt any rate the outlook for suffrage in the District was never brighter\nthan it is to day. Senator has even gone so far as to say that Washington \n\n\n2 \nmay expect favorable action at this session and the time is ripe to get the\nmatter to a vote. While there's life, there's hope, so I'm hoping that before \nlong I may cast my ballot for somebody for something.\nIt will be a great thing for the colored people of the District of Columbia\nwhen they are enfranchised. It will be possible to remedy certain conditions\nhere which can never be changed except thru the suffrage. It is claimed \nby many that the real reason why citizens in the National Capital are deprived\nof the ballet is because so many colored people would be able to use it,\nit they were enfranchised. So the white citizens have to suffer in order to\nhandicap colored people. But it looks as though the white worm was begining\nto turn and now the dark one will have a chance to move a little. Let's hope\nhe will move in the right direction.\n\nSo Marcus Garvey has been deported.  Whatever one may think of him on\ngeneral principals, there is no doubt that he enunciated a big idea. It is \ngreatly to be regretted that anything happened which made it possible to put \nconvict and sentence him. But he had an idea and he had the courage to tell it\nto the world.  Africa for the Africans was his slogan. He had as much right\nto insist upon that as has an Asiatic to declare that \nhe believes Asia should be for the Asiatics or as much right to take that\nstand as has an American who proclaims loudly from the housetops that America \nshould be for the Americans.  It is quite likely that Marcus Garvey's propaganda \nin behalf of Africans owning their own country made England sit up and\ntake notice. It does not require great stretch of the imagination to believe \nthat England had a little to do with the bringing Garvey into the Courts. Any \nblack man who tried to teach the Africans they should possess their own land\nand have something to say about governing it would greatly incur the displeasure \nof Great Britain. For Great Britain is the great Robber Nation of the\nworld.  She has stolen the continent of Australia from the natives.who are\ntreated as serfs. She has appropriated India and rules with an iron hand.\nShe has laid heavy hands upon Africa and seized large tracts which are full\nof diamonds and gold.

C.\n\nMy dear Mrs. Terrelll:\n\nWhy establish a Home Study Department?  What need is there for such\nan effort?  Why not let the established schools do this work?  The answer\nis simple and clear. \n\nRecently a Negro instructor in a college was asked to give a curse\nin Negro history.  He treated the request as a joke.  He has been well instructed\nin the story of the Hebrews, the Greeks, and the Romans.  He has\nmade a special study of the achievements of Europeans and Americans.  He has\nbeen taught that these nations accomplished all.  From his point of view,\ntherefore, there is no other history worth considering.\n\nThe fact is that the so-called history teaching in our schools and\ncolleges is downright propaganda, and effort to praise one race and to decry\nthe other to justify social repression and exploitation.  The world is still\nin darkness as to the actual progress of mankind.  Each corner of the universe\nhas tended to concern itself merely with the exploits of its own\nparticular heroes.  Students and teachers of our time, therefore, are the\nvictims of this selfish propaganda.\n\nThe Association is trying to bring before the world the whole truth\nthat the truth may make men free.  To do this it has decided not only to\npublish informing books but to offer by mail instruction in Negro life and\nhistory.  The Home Study Department has, therefore, been established for\nthe special benefit of those who would like to study the aspects of African\ncivilization which were neglected in the schools in which they were trained.\n\nThese courses are conducted by correspondents.  They cover every aspect\nof the history of the Negro race, its economic progress, its social\nproblems, African Art, African Anthropology, and African Philosophy.  Some\nof the most distinguished scholars of this country have been secured as instructors.\nThe circular herewith enclosed will give particulars.  The undersigned\nwill be delighted to answer further inquiries and will enroll any one\ndesiring to become a student.\n\nRespectfully yours, \n[*C G Woodson*]\nC. G.

C. \n\nMy dear Mrs. Terrell: \n\nYou will be interested to learn of the continued successful\ncareer of the National Urban League which you have helped to\nfunction with your financial assistance.\n\nAlthough the Mississippi flood situation has ceased to be\nhead-line news in our daily papers, the work of the relief and rehabilitation\nhas gone on and the League has played some part in seeing\nthat the large proportion of Negroes in that district (estimated\nas high as eighty per cent) have received equable treatment.\nThe League appealed to President Coolidge, to Mr. Hoover \nand the Red Cross for the appointment of representative Negroes\nas advisors to those in charge of the relief.  Such a Commission\nwas appointed with Dr. Robert R. Morton as Chairman and two representatives\nof the Urban League staff on the Committee. \n\nThis Committee has been active in making investigations in the\nflooded districts and bringing recommendations to the attention of\nMr. Hoover and the Red Cross.  The results obtained thus far are\nsatisfactory and the Committee will continue throughout the rehabilitation\nperiod.\n\nOur monthly magazine, \"Opportunity\", keeps us its usual high\nstandards of discussion on race relations.\n\nWe have just selected four \"Fellows\" in Social Service for the\nschool year 1927-28 from a group of fifty-two (52) applicants -- \ncollege graduates who presented splendid papers in the contest for\nthese honors.\n\nENDORSED BY THE NATIONAL INFORMATION BUREAU \n\n\n[*5 1/2*]\n(in fact he enjoys exercise of any kind) \nMr. Wells enjoys walking and invited me to take a stroll around the [*See below*] \nwonderful grounds with him.  While we were talking I told him I intended to \nwrite a book entitled \"The Confessions of a Colored Woman.\"  \"I like the title\ne said it will be widely read in England.  But write it dispassionately.\" \n\n[Monsieur Finot, editor of the La Revue Mondiale gave his Death Agony of the\nScience of Race which had been translated [*from the French to English*] by Mr. W. T. Stead, editor of the Review\nvue Mendiale.] [*The Reviews + Begin here -*]  He told me he had talked with several rich Americans who had offered \nto back him with money, if he would stop his foolish prattle about the\nequality of races.  A woman who is at the head of one of the large organizations \nin the United States had taken the time and the pains to call on him to argue\nagainst the stand he had taken and to tell hi she did not agree with his views\non the Negroes.  \"I admire you very much\" he said, \"because you might so easily\nleave the race and be something else.  It shows great strength of character.\" \nM. Finot insists that there is no such thing as the superiority and inferiority\nof races [*and*] He is sure things are going to become better for the dark race.\nWhen I expressed the hope that Frenchmen would not learn to discriminate\nagainst human beings on account of color, he said he is certain that Americans \ncannot teach Frenchmen prejudice on account of color.  Every Frenchman with whom I talked expressed\n[*See next page + 5 3/4*] the same opinion.  [*Whenever it was possible*] I could not resist the temptation of [*I*] talk[*ed*] \nwith every black Frenchman I met, [wherever it was possible to do so.] I would \nquestion them closely about their status in France, whether they were discriminated \nagainst in any way and how they were treated on general principles. \n[* Each and every one assured me they were treated exactly like other Fr no matter where they went -*] \nBut a conversation I had with one French,African cured me of the habit.\nI had asked him whether he could attend any school he chose, whether he could be\nserved in any restaurant he entered, or accommodated in any hotel at which he wished to\nstop.  The more I questioned him, the more puzzled he became.  Finally in a tone denoting that he was both he said,\nsurprised and grieved, he replied \nMaisMadame, Les Francais nous aiment.\"  (Tht, Madame, the French people love us.\nHis attitude toward me and the tone of his voice were precisely what one would\nexpect from a child who had been asked whether his mother and father gave him enough\nto eat, a clean bed to sleep in and decent clothes to wear.

Each of\nthe younger classes in the village school, for instance, might pledge itself\nto give a penny a week-each child assuming the responsibility in\nturn throughout the year-classes in the higher grades, two cents\neach, and the teachers, three cents per week. Such centers of village\nlife as the store and the post-office might also be utilized on this basis.\nIt is remarkable how large a fund, by degrees, can be aggregated\nthrough these mites, which no one misses. Personal canvass, too,\nwould discover many wage-earners willing to give one, two or three\npennies each week toward a general fund for such a purpose.\n\nThen, as to the active work of the association, let it first of all be\nwholly democratic and free from any atmosphere of exclusiveness or\n\nA Station Garden on the Seaboard Air Line\n\ncaste. The common object of the organization is the betterment of\nthe common home, and the child in tatters who weeds the gutter edge\nis contributing just as real a share of this as is the daintily gloved woman\nwho dispenses packages of seeds. Let the prizes, too, be numerous\nrather than large, and well defined as to object. These may be\nfor the best vine-covered backyard fence-with \"best\" explicitly defined-\nthe best grass plot, the cleanest gutter, the neatest fence row.\nIf one or two in the community can have access to detailed information\nas to what other towns are doing, it would be a capital idea to acquaint\nthe local workers, especially the children, with this by means of\nshort illustrative talks once in each of the four seasons, perhaps,\napropos of the work of that season. It would give them prospective\nfood for original thought and work which would eventually benefit far\nwider areas than back yards.\n\nThe Negro as a Factor in Business                         455\n\nMuch refuse can be burned and the ashes utilized on roads.

Have a special prize for an orderly woodpile,\nalso for the best twenty-five feet of cinder-made walk-possibly even the\nmost inviting pig-sty, if two such are within the town's limits. Make the\nrange of attack as wide as possible from the first. Nothing that is not as\nit might be and therefore should be, is too insignificant for effort. Bearing\nthese cardinal points in mind, that energy and determination are\nmore important factors in village improvement than money, and that\nthe simplest rules of cleanliness, order and thrift which any child may\nfollow are the most effective foundation for success, there is no reason\nwhy six months of such work in any town should not accomplish\na practical municipal reformation.\n\nThe Negro as a Factor in Business\n\nW.S. SCARBOROUGH*\n\nIF every Negro now engaged in business in any part of our great\ncommonwealth should be removed from such business-should\nsuddenly drop out of sight-his removal would not create a ripple in\nbusiness circles, so slight is his hold upon the money centers of the\ncountry. His financial value plays such an insignificant part in the commercial\nworld that, whatever happens, he would not be missed. There\nare reasons for this. In the first place, the members of the race that\nare engaged in any kind of paying business are comparatively few. A\ngeneration is not sufficient to develop business men, and the Negro is not\nmuch over a generation old. Then again those that are thus engaged\nhave no great financial influence as the result of their holdings-\neither of stock or bonds-to the extent that the market can be affected\nin any way, whether success or failure attends them.\n\nWe have colored business men throughout the country but\ncomparatively few of them are doing business on a large scale. The\nrace has made wonderful advancement in countless ways in the last\nforty years. All this should be placed to its credit. But marvellous\nas this is, there has been no point in its career when it could safely \npause for even a moment. On, on, and on it has had to go, and on\nand on it must keep going, with ever accelerated pace, to keep up with\nthe throbbing life and movement of civilization that now surround it.\n\n*Professor W.S.

Will not these conditions exist\nin some localities and among some people for many years to come\nand will they not be especially true of Indians as they come out\nfrom government care and support? Will the young man who may\ngo back to Rosebud of Darlington, knowing only carpentry, be likely\nto succeed as a carpenter? Should he not, in addition to knowing\nsomething of housebuilding, also know something of plastering, painting,\nmixing mortar, and chimney making? Should not the wheelwright\nknow something of blacksmithing and painting, and would it be amiss\nif he also knew a little about mending harness? Should not the farmer\nknow a little of carpentry and wagon repairing, and enough blacksmithing\nso that with a hand forge he could mend a broken chain or\nbolt, and save a long drive to the village? It is true that if the spirit\nof thrift is lacking, these various accomplishments will amount to little,\nbut this is not altogether the case, and one of the things which will encourage\nan Indian to copy his white brother's thrift is the sense of\npower which comes to him from knowing how to do things as the white\nman does.\n\nThe Indian boy and girl on going back to their own people must\nof a necessity be, in a more or less marked degree, pioneers in the advancement\nof their people. If in educating an Indian, one believes in\nsending him back among his own people he must be prepared in the\nbest possible way for his environment. Hampton believes that this \nmeans for the boys a substantial training along some skilled line of\nhandicraft, with as much of some other trades interwoven as will make\nwell-rounded and useful mechanics; and for the girls a general knowledge\nof the housewife's arts, together with some other accomplishments\nwhich will make it possible for her home to become a more tidy\nand attractive one.\n\nI have in mind a Cherokee boy who is about to go back to his\nreservation, who can do a very good job at house-building, and in addition\nsome bricklaying, plastering and tin-roofing. He can roughly\npaint a house, barn or wagon, and has lately added to his accomplishments\na little harness- and shoe-making. I have seen some straps\nwhich he has just made with the buckles neatly stitched on, also a completed\nbridle, all of which are very creditably done. He has also half-\nsoled and heeled his own shoes for nearly a year.\n\nThe class of girls who will return this summer have added in the\nlast few months to their general knowledge of household work, a little\nskill in paper-hanging, mattress-making, painting and glazing. In\nmattress making, such homely experience as would be likely to be a\npart of the Indian girl's life has been practiced; for instance, the\nmaking of mattresses and pillows from corn husks and dry grass.\n\n\"Indian Basketry\"                             461\n\nApplications are constantly coming in from returned students for\na year's special work at the trades. One such, a Navaho, left us a year\nago a very good carpenter, and during the year at home he has done\nexcellent work both at his trade and in other ways, and is very anxious\nto return to get painting, glazing, tin-roofing, gutter work, bricklaying\nand plastering. Of course, the amount of each trade which he can\nget will be very limited, but a little knowledge will go a long way in\nthe simple buildings on his reservation. We suggested to him that\npainting and tin-roofing were not practiced much among the Navahoes,\nand were not likely to be for some time, but he said he could work for\nwhite people in his neighborhood, as well as for the Indians; if the\nboys who are returning can show their elders the advantages of improved\nhouses, and can themselves make the improvements, the Indians\nwill gradually adopt them. Then, too, there are openings for industrial\nteachers in Indian schools, and, it is the all-round mechanic who\ncan be the most useful in such places. To the Indian who is expected\nto go among whites to earn his living as a mechanic, it would be better\nto give a thorough training along some special line. For instance,\na Seneca was given the machinist's trade, and at the end of three years,\nwas able to go into a shop in one of the large cities of the North, where\nhe has held his position as a machinist with much credit for three years\nIn such cases, which are rare, it seems justifiable to allow specialization,\nbut Hampton does not encourage it very much for Indians, believing\nthat her trade students would either drift into the larger settlements\nof whites, or, not finding work at their special trades among\nthe Indians, would become discouraged and shiftless-a drag on their\npeople.

By George Wharton James. Henry Malkan,\nPublisher.\n\nThe variety and extent of basket making among the Indians, past\nand present, is not very generally known. Most tourists to the summer\nresorts on the Maine coast and in the White Mountains and the Adirondacks\nhave looked over, with more or less interest, the assortment\nof fancy wares, made of willow slips and sweet grass, which some\nwandering members of the Penobscot or other Algonquian tribes have", "24", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00536", "466                    Southern Workman\n\nnecessary apparatus for teaching, a reasonable length of term and a\ngood salary, while others were forced to wend their way into rural districts,\nthere to grapple with difficulties unknown to them. I had hoped\nfor the former fate, but was introduced to the latter. A rude\nbuilding with few or no accommodations, and an average attendance of\nsixty pupils indiscriminately mixed as to age and grade became the\nobject of my attention for six months in Mathews County, Va\n\nI reviewed my Hampton notes and started for my school in time\nto reach there a few days before the date of opening. I saw the trustees\nand patrons, visited the school-house and put it in order with the\nassistance of the children and their mothers. Our sweeping was done\nwith brooms broken from the waving pines which surrounded the\nschool-house. I began work on the appointed date. As I was there only\none short term, it is sufficient to say that the work moved on well. I\nthink I did more thorough work and saw better results at the close of\nthe term than I would have under more favorable circumstances,\nbecause I worked harder bring them about. Besides teaching through\nthe week, I had charge of a class in Sunday-school, conducted\nthe Sunday-school teacher's meeting and acted as chorister. I was\nalso asked to help along other lines still more widely separated from\nmy class-room work, sometimes to prescribe for a patient, sometimes to\nadvise on points of law. At the close of six months, I arranged\nwith the trustees and patrons to extend the term two months, each\nfather or mother paying fifty cents per month for each child.\n\nIn 1888, I returned to Hampton for my Senior year. After graduating,\nI taught in the public school in Norfolk Co., my home. This\nschool had been taught formerly by Hampton graduates. I was second\nassistant in the school; therefore the way was prepared and I had\nonly to begin to work. My past experience and what I was now undergoing\nrevealed to me that merely to be familiar with a subject is not \nnecessarily to be able to impart it to others, and that if my teaching was to\nbe a success I should have work upon myself as well as on my pupils.\nThis I began to do, and am sure I have studied much harder since\nleaving Hampton than while a student here. In Norfolk County my\nsuperintendent advised his teachers to close their rooms one day during\nthe term for the purpose of visiting other schools. This opportunity\nI gladly availed myself of. I found that one could learn something\neven from looking at poor teaching. One year when I went\nNorth early for summer work, I gained much help and inspiration\nfrom visiting some of the public schools in Boston, Mass. I worked in\nNorfolk County seven years. During that time I was made first assistant\nin the school.\n\nMy work then was not wholly confined to my class-room. A literary\nsociety had been organized in the school, for the young men and\nwomen of the community, some of whom did not come to school. I \nassisted in this and in some other work, and started some new organizations\nmyself. When I found that I was teacher of Class No.\n1 in Sunday-school, superintendent of the Band of Mercy, president of\nof the temperance society, secretary of the Baptist Young People's\nUnion, chorister for the church and superintendent of the King's\nDaughters' Circles as well as public school teacher, I decided that\nteaching school among our people means something more than\nclass-room work. During the summer months I conducted an\nevening school for adults who were anxious to improve themselves.\nThis school was taught in the church-study and was attended\nthree nights each week by the deacons, the superintendent of the Sunday\n\nA Hampton Graduate's Experience                       467\n\nSunday school and other good citizens of the place, mostly men. These\npupils were seldom tardy, and lessons were well prepared and recited\nafter a hard day of physical labor. Some of the girls and boys who were\nunder my instruction in Mathews and Norfolk counties afterward\nwent to the Gloucester High School, some are teaching, some married,\nsome came to Hampton and some are here now.\n\nIn 1895, I gave up the work in Norfolk Co., for a position in the\nNormal and Industrial School at High Point, N.C., where I am at\npresent. This is a boarding school for our young women and men, a\nmission of the Society of Friends, with colored principal and teachers.\nHere, as in other places, I was called upon for instruction which I had\nnot been trained to give. The school was in its infancy and has not\npassed that stage yet. The girls needed to be taught sewing and the\nboard could not then employ another teacher. I was asked if I would\ntake charge of the sewing department, together with my academic work.\nI thought of General Armstrong's words: \"What are Christians\nput into the world for, but to do the impossible through the strength\nof God?\"  After some explanations, I said yes, and began the \"impossible.\"\nThe girls learned to cut, make and mend ordinary garments.\nAt the close of the term we had a sale of the articles made, and the\nnet proceeds were sufficient to purchase the things most needed to\nbegin with next term. As soon as a special teacher could be employed\nfor this work, I gave it up and remained in the academic department,\nbut I am still engaged in industrial education. Every lesson in\ngeography, grammar and arithmetic has its industrial side. The story\nof Booker T. Washington's entrance examination, as he terms it, here\nat Hampton has been published in the Youth's Companion, the Outlook\nand other papers; it has been read and discussed, but if it had a \nstill wider circulation I think it would do good, for there are too many\nboys and girls who have not learned that\n\n\"Who sweeps a room as for they laws,\nMakes that and the action fine.\"\n\nThe department which claims the greater part of my attention\nis the primary department. There is no other for which I would exchange\nit\nexcept the kindergarten. We have not this department in\nour school, but it is my aim to work one up. One of the things which\nseems to hinder the progress of our people is lack of economy. If\nthrift and economy could be more emphasized, it would be well. I\nthink there is no better place to begin than the primary school. With\nthis in view I am arranging with the Penny Provident Fund in New\nYork for the establishment of a station at High Point. If the children \nare taught to save their pennies now they will value a dollar more when\nthey are older. Many lessons of usefulness can be impressed by the\nprimary teacher. A love for the beautiful can be cultivated. I have\nintroduced flowers into the homes by planting seeds in boxes in the\nschool-room and also letting the children plant them. I have put pictures\non the walls in the different homes by decorating the schoolroom\nwalls, and calling attention to them. Of the 116 pupils on my\nroll, I know every child's parent or guardian. Apart from the primary\nwork and some duties pertaining strictly to the boarding department,\nI find time to do a little work in the town. The Woman's Christian\nTemperance Union has its different branches of work. There are\nthe Flower Mission and mothers' meetings and other societies. I assist\nin all these. Again, the children come to me in the town in a body of Loyal\nTemperance Legion workers, who have pledged themselves against\nthe use of alcohol, tobacco and profanity.", "27", 84, 84, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00358", "6437 Langley Avenue,\nChicago, Illinois,\nAugust 9, 1927.\n\nMy dear Mrs. Terrrell,\n\nI feel very much ashamed of myself for not having\nlet  you know what I had done with the article that you\nso kindly sent upon my request.\n\nI received it in time to complete my task before\nthe initiation and was about ready to return it when a \nyoung man came to see me.\n\nThe man was MrM Horace Mann Bond who will receive\nhis Doctors degree in Sociology at the close of the summer\nquarter,University of Chicago.

It is said Secretary Chase\nwas the first to enter.\n\nHe found Mr. Lincoln in a good humor,\nreading a book which seemed to\namuse him very much. \"Say, Chase,\"\nsaid the President, \"did you ever read\nthis book?\"\n\n\"What book is it?\" asked Chase.\n\n\"Artemus Ward,\" replied Lincoln.\n\"Let me read you a chapter entitled,\n'Wax Wurx in Albany.' \"\n\nSo it is said the President began reading,\nas other members of the Cabinet\ngradually came in. At last Stanton,\nusually of a morose and sullen disposition,\nconsequential and thoroughly convinced\nof his own importance, said he\nwas in a great hurry, and if there was any\nbusiness to be done, he would like to do\nit at once, and remarked that the President\nmight more profitably occupy his\nmind, than in the reading of such light\nliterature. The President replied, \"These\nare troublous times, and unless I have\nsome diversion, similar to this, my heart\nwould break,\" laid down the book, opened\na drawer, took out a paper and said,\n\"Gentlemen, I have called you together\nto notify you what I have determined to\n\ndo. I want no advice. Nothing can\nchange my mind.\"\n\nHe than read the Proclamation of\nEmancipation.

Chase was the last to leave, and as\nhe looked back, he saw that the President\nhad taken up his book and was again enjoying\nthe \"Wax Wurx in Albany.\"\n\nThe Proclamation was not immediately\nissued and was kept in abeyance for just\none month. In the meantime Lincoln\nwrote that celebrated letter to Horace\nGreeley, of which his enemies have made\nso much capital, in which he said that he\n\"wished to save the Union,\" that he would\n\"save it with slavery, if he could,\" that\n\"if it was necessary to destroy slavery,\nin order to save the Union, he would.\"\n\nThis letter is said to have produced universal\ngloom around the firesides of freedom.\nMany thought the great leader\nwas faltering, that he was not true to his\nexpressed sentiments of liberty, and that\nhe was about to forsake the cause for\nwhich he was chosen, yet this letter was\nwritten when the Emancipation Proclamation\nhad been in his hands for thirty\ndays, since this letter was written on the\n22d day of August, 1862. just one month\nafter the Cabinet meeting.\n\nFinally, when his opportunity came, on\nthat eventful day, on the 22d day of September,\n1862, the most illustrious day to\nthe sons of freedom, throughout the civilized\nworld, the most auspicious, in the\nhistory of the American negro, the Emancipation\n\nAbraham Lincoln.   409\n\nEmancipation Proclamation was issued. He\nsaid in referring to this glorious document,\nthese immortal words, indigenous\nto the soil of freedom and as universal\nas nature, \"In giving freedom to\nthe slave, we assure freedom to the free.\"\nTruer words were never spoken, for\nwhen the South held the negro, as chattel,\nshe enslaved herself, and during all that\nawful period not one oasis of immortal\nthought appeared upon her intellectual\ndesert. Everywhere there was desolation\nand decay, for it is the immutable law\nof God, as fixed as the stars, that you can\nnot put shackles upon the limbs of man,\nwhether physical or mental, by force or\nedict, without putting corresponding\nmanacles upon your own brain.\n\nNo book was produced within the borders\nof her domain that will live or add\none jot to the great storehouse of human\nknowledge; no paper, no scientist, no\nmagazine, no poet, no journalist, no philanthropist,\nno inventor, not one sail was\nseen upon her intellectual sea, not a wing\ncleft the air of her mental horizon - all\nwas darkness and despair. This accursed\nsystem had conclusively demonstrated\nthat you cannot degrade your \nbrother without self-degradation.\n\nPut the Proclamation was only the beginning\nof the end. The party of Lincoln\nwas everywhere beset with enemies, foes\nwithin and foes without. England gave\nthe Confederacy every assistance and permitted\nher to build the Alabama in her\nshipyards, the Pope at Rome gave words\nof encouragement to the South, the Marquis\nof Salisbury and Louis Napoleon\nwere bitterly opposed to the North.\n\nDuring the war many questions arose\nas to whether the slaves could be seized\nand whether they should be returned to\n\nthe South. Benjamin Butler - peace rest\nhis ashes - always a true and tried friend\nof the Negro, maintained that, accepting\n\nBen Butler\n\nthe definition of the South, that the slaves\nwere chattel, they should be \"contraband\nof war.\"\n\nThis gave the black man an opportunity\nto strike for himself, and more courageous\nor truer soldier never stood to his guns.\nHe dug the trenches, carried his knapsack,\nkept weary watch on picket lines,\nand in the fierce ordeal of battle, made the\npatriot's supreme sacrifice.

His first experience of life began with his\ngrandparents, Betsy and Isaac Bailey in Talbot County, Eastern\nShore, Maryland. His only recollections of his mother were of\na few hasty visits made in the night, on foot, from another \nplantation, 12 miles distant. The slave system had no interest in \nrecognizing or preserving any of the ties that bind families together or to\ntheir homes, but sought to reduce man to a level with the beast. Of\nhis father, he knew nothing. Slavery had no recognition of fathers,\nas of families.  That the mother was a slave was enough for its\ndeadly purpose.\nWhen Frederick was less than seven\nyears of age, he joined his brother.\nPerry, and his two sisters, Sarah and\n Eliza, and in so doing, learned the sad\nfact that his childhood, his grandparents\nand all the little children around belonged\nto a mysterious person \"Old\nMaster\"  His childhood experiences there\nacquainted him with a slave child's\nlot, slave murders and many revolting\nfeatures of slavery.\nHe learned of the blood-bought luxuries\nat the \"Great House\", how the\nlive stock fared better than the blacks\nand the gilding of slavery in all forms.\nHe learned that the songs of the slaves\nrepresented their sorrows rather than\ntheir joys. Like tears, they were a relief\nto aching hearts.\nNothing cruel or shocking happened\nto Frederick except cold and hunger\nand at the age of nine he was taken\nto Baltimore.  In retrospection, Douglass\nregarded this removal as one of the\nmost fortunate events of his life. But\nfor this mere circumstance, before the\nrigors of slavery had fully fastened\nupon him, and crushed his young spirit\nunder the iron control of a slave driver,\nhe probably would have continued in\nslavery until emancipated by the war.\nThere in Baltimore, for seven years\nthe most interesting feature of his history\nwas his learning, under somewhat\nmarked disadvantages, to read and\nwrite.  Frederick was taught his alphabet\nand to read by his new mistress\nand his white playmates, and learned\nfirst to write at his new master's ship\nyard where he had been given small\nchores.\nThe Bible awakened his religious nature\nand gave him faith and hope and\nthe newspapers acquainted him with the\nAbolitionists.  The precious learning\nthough miserably reminding him of\nhis bondage, strengthened his determination\nto seek knowledge for the \npathway from slavery to freedom.\nIn March, 1833, Frederick was sent\nback to the plantation near St. Michaels\nto work. He was unsuited for slavery\nphysically and emotionally so after\nnumerous severe whippings, without\nany visible improvement in his character\nor conduct, he was put out \"to\nbe broken\" by a man named Edward\nCovey, who enjoyed the reputation of\nbeing a first rate hand at breaking\nyoung Negroes.  This Covey subjected\nhim to his first brutal floggings that\nleft his back raw with open sores and\nheavy blows that gave him warm salty\ntastes of his own blood.  His experiences\nwere bitterly cruel, not only the\nbreaking in process through which he\nwas carried, but his intellect languished,\nhis disposition to read departed and \nseemingly became reduced to the level\nof a brute. This physical wretchedness\ncontinued on until one of the hottest\ndays in the month of August when the\nturning point in his life occurred.\nFrederick was fighting madness and\ndaring spirit resisted Covey in a \n\"rought\" and tumble\" fight for two\nhours and bested him.  This battle\nchanged him from a \"nothing\" to a\n\"man\".  It recalled to life his self-respect,\nhis self-confidence and inspired\nhim with a renewed determination\nto be a free man.\nHis term of service with Covey expired\non Christmas Day, 1834, and because\nthe report had gone abroad that\nhe was hard to whip, guilty of kicking\nback and because of his ability to read\nand write, he was considered a bad\nsheep that would spoil the flock, so\nhe was sent again to Baltimore to\nwork in the shipyards.\nIt was from there, on Monday, September,\n1838, that Frederick bade farewell\nto that city and slavery. His manner\nof escape was not disclosed by him\nuntil forty years later, so fearful was\nhe that disclosure of his manner might\nprevent similar ones and also place in\nperil the persons who had assisted him.\nIt was the custom in the State of Maryland\nto require of the free Negro people\nto have what were called free papers.\nFrederick was not fortunate enough\nto resemble any of his free acquaintances\nto answer the description on their papers\nbut he did have one friend- a\nsailor-who owned a sailor's protection,\nwhich answered somewhat the purpose\nof free papers - describing his person\nand certifying to the fact that he was \na free American sailor.\nRigged out in sailor style red shirt,\ntarpaulin hat and black cravat, using\nthe sailor's pass and explaining to the\nconductor that he never \"carried his\nfree papers to sea\", Frederick reached\nNew York safely in less than twenty-four\nhours and ended his experience as\na slave.\nUpon advice from the New York Vigilance\nCommittee in New York, it was\npromptly decided that since Frederick's\ntrade was that of a calker, he should\ngo to New Bedford, Massachusetts. His\nintended wife, a free woman, came on\nfrom Baltimore.\nThey were married and journeyed on to\nsafety in Massachusetts.  Here, a comparatively\nunimportant question arose, a\nname by which he should be known\nthereafter in his new relation as a free\nman.  The name give him by his mother\nwas that of Frederick Augustus Washington\nBailey.\nFor safety, his host in New Bedford,\nNathan Johnson, selected the name of\nFrederick Douglass for him, having just\nfinished reading the virtues of Douglass\nof Scotland in \"Lady of the Lake\".\nFrederick Douglass began his life's\nwork as a lecturer and Abolitionist in the \nsummer of 1841.  His suffrage fight took\nhim into Rhodes Island, Vermont, Indiana\nand many other states on convention\ntours.  His trials and triumphs as a liberator\nwere many.  He wielded a mighty\npen as well as a voice in building up a\npublic sentiment which would send slavery\nto the grave.\nSo strong was his proof against the\nadvocates and apologists of slavery that\nhe was led to seek refuge in England\n\nContinued on Page 23\n\n23\nSouthern Exposure\nA report of the Southern Region of the Oklahoma Federation of\nColored Women's Club\n\nMESSAGE\nTogether we build-National\nTogether we grow-State\nForward in service-Local\nLifting as we climb always\ninsure their effectiveness.\nTo serve humanity is the ideal of\nthe Southern Region Colored Women's\nClubs.

Elementary school is segregated under\nDistrict laws, has 25 pupils, four teachers. Most of children were born deaf.\nDEAF CHILDREN CAN BE TAUGHT\nTO TALK AT SPECIAL SCHOOLS\nSOME VISITORS to Kendall school on Gallaudet's campus are surprised\nwhen for the first time they hear a deaf child speak. Yet\ntoday deafness need not go hand in hand with muteness. This is being\nproved every day at Kendall and at other schools like it throughout\nthe country. Teachers admit frankly that it is impossible for a deaf\nchild to speak normally, but say that he can learn to speak well enough\nto be understood.\nLearning to talk is one of the most difficult jobs a child can tackle,\nfor he is really learning a foreign language. Having never heard English\nspoken and being unable to hear his own voice only makes the task\nmore formidable. Perfection is not expected of the children at Kendall,\nbut they are encouraged to learn as much as they can, are assured\nthat friends and associates will overlook their deficiencies.\nIdeally, deaf children should begin their education when they are\nthree or four years old. In Krendall's pre-school classes, they are introduced\nto speech and lip-reading, begin to think in words. They\nlearn, for example, that they have names, and that other people and\nthings may also be identified verbally. After a year the average child\nspeaks 20 words, lip-reads 50 more.\nIn high school, the students are taught sign language, the almost\nuniversally intelligible tounge of the deaf. Anxious at they are to\nmaster speech, the deaf are justly proud of the language of signs.\n\"Put a deaf Frenchman, an American and a Dane together and they\ncan all communicate through this one language,\" a student declared.\n\"What other language can claim as much?\"\nLearning to speak, Albert Johnson, 7, is shown how sound is made.

Second wife, Helen Pitts,\nmaintained the house after his death, made it a shrine to his memory.\n\nI REMEMBER DOUGLASS  Continued\nGreat homage was paid him, especially by white people who\nrecognized him. Mothers with their children would stop him and say\n\"You are Frederick Douglass, aren't you? Please shake hands with\nmy little boy, because when he grows up I want him to be able to\nsay that he once shook hands with the great Frederick Douglass.\"\nWhen his patience slackened Douglass suggested, \"Let's get\non the scenic railway so that we may have a chance to talk a\nlittle.  Nobody can get us there.\"  But we had no sooner settled\nourselves on the little scenic railway than a man reached over two\nseats to touch him on the shoulder and greet him.  \"Well, we'll go\nup on the Eiffel Tower, \" chuckled Douglass.  But just as we\nstarted to ascend a man in another cage shouted: \"Hello, Mr.\nDouglass!  The last time I saw you was in Rochester.\"\nDouglass was a man of infinite patience, tact and graciousness.\nHe was never rude and was careful to do or say nothing that\nwould hurt anybody's feelings.  To me he was a practical Christian.\nJudged by his deeds there has been no better Christian in the\nUnited States.  He enjoyed helping others.\nHe encouraged and aided promising and talented young Negroes.\nAs an example, he had become deeply interested in Paul\nLaurence Dunbar, the poet because of his bitter struggle for\nexistence and recognition. I first heard of Dunbar from Douglass.\nOne day by appointment I went to see Douglass in his Anacostia\nhome.  After we had finished our business Douglass, who was\nwidely known as \"the Sage of Anacostia,\" asked me, \"Have you\never heard of Paul Dunbar?\"  I told him I had not.  Then Douglass\ntold me Dunbar's story.\n\"He is very young, \" he said, \"but there is no doubt that he is a\npoet. He is working under the most discouraging circumstances\nin his home in Dayton, Ohio.  He is an elevator boy and on his\nmeager wage of four dollars a week he is trying to support his\nmother and himself.  Let me read you one of his poems.\" Douglass\nleft the room and returned with a newspaper clipping from which\nhe began to read Dunbar's The Drowsy Day.  When he had read\nseveral stanzas his voice faltered and his eyes grew moist. He was\ndeeply moved.  \"What a tragedy it is,\" he said, \"that a young man\nwith such talent should be so terribly handicapped by poverty\nand color.\"  I shall never forget Douglass's reading of that poem.\nI remember a delightful dinner with Douglass and his family\none summer on Chesapeake Bay. Shortly after our marriage, my\nhusband and I were invited by Major Charles Douglass, one of\nFrederick Douglass's sons, to take dinner with his father his wife\nand himself at Highland Beach, which is about five miles from \n", "79", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00565", "440   Howard's American Magazine.\n\nkept his finger nails as clean and polished\nas the driven snow. Old \"Budd\" had\nbeen down on his luck and tried every\nsystem known to the fraternity, had\nchanged his play and followed the play of\nothers, and, as he put it, \"ef old 'Budd'\nshould go up agin the lay-out of nature\nan' play the sun to rise, durned ef I don't\nbelieve the feller that 'coppered' thet bet\nwould cash.\"\n\nThis had been an especially stormy day.\nThe vaudeville was over, the stories had\nbeen told in Dalton's, and the game had\nstarted in earnest. Mr. Dalton was engaged\nat his favorite occupation - counting\nmoney. There was a pleased expression\nupon his face, until he suddenly exclaimed,\n\"Hello, here is a bad two-dollar\nbill. I wonder where that money came\nfrom.\"\n\nFrom pleasure to pain, like a flash of\nlightning, the facial expression changed.\n\nMr. Dalton was deeply grieved whenever\nhe was the victim of dishonest design,\nabsolutely unscrupulous about\neverything but gambling - in any game\nof chance his word was his bond, for he\nhad experience enough with gamblers to\nknow sharp practice would not only be\nquickly discountenanced, but would injure\nhis business.\n\n\"Well,\" said Dalton to the bookkeeper,\n\"some one has given it to me; I must give\nit to some one else.\" A few minutes\nafterward, in looking over his accounts,\nhe saw that he was debtor to old man\nBudd for his services as \"lookout\" for\nthe preceding night. Calling the old\nman, he sneaked the counterfeit bill to\nhim, with the remark that the play was\nlight and the house was compelled to chop\nexpenses.\"\n\nSmall pay indeed for all-night work of\n\nthat kind, even if the money was good,\nbut the old man was in very straightened\ncircumstances and had to be content. The\ntwo dollars would, perchance, pay his\nlaundry bill.\n\nBut before the laundry was considered\n\"Budd\" and the \"Kid\" concluded some\nstimulant would not be untimely, and in\naccordance with their wishes, the barkeepers\nof the \"Red Dragon\" prepared\nthe concoctions ordered, and \"Budd\" innocently\ngave him the bill he had received\nfrom Dalton. Jim Dalton had an eye\nlike an eagle, for anything concerning\nhis own interests. \"Hello, there, 'Budd,' \"\nsaid he, seizing the bill, \"that's a bogus\nnote.\"\n\n\"No, I'll be durned ef it is, Mr. Dalton;\nyou gave it to me yourself.\"\n\n\"No, I didn't, 'Budd.' Don't you come\nsuch tricks on me,\" said the amiable Dalton.\n\"I'll have to charge you for those\ndrinks.\"\n\n\"No, you won't,\" spoke up the \"Kid,\"\nfor he heartily detested Dalton. \"I have\nthe price,\" said he, as he placed the necessary\nchange on the bar. \"That's a fresh\nyoungster,\" remarked Dalton to the barkeeper,\nas the \"Kid\" and \"Budd\" started\nfor upstairs.\n\nThey found the game in progress, and\nthey withdrew to one side to compare\nnotes, or, in the parlance of the fraternity,\nto tell hard luck stories. The bright\nglare of the fire shone full force into the\n\"Kid's\" face. It was flushed and the\nlines were deeply drawn about the mouth.\nThe conversation of the two men turned\nupon the efficacy of certain signs and\nomens, clothes and seasons of the year\nbetokening good luck or adversity.\n\nAt last, with much earnestness and a\nvoice full of pathos, the \"Kid\" spoke up.\n\nThe Queen of Hearts.   441\n\n\"Say, 'Budd,' I am weary of this life, and\nthe first good winning I make I propose\nto go home. I have an old mother,\" said\nthe \"Kid\" with some feeling and just the\nfaintest suspicion of moisture in his clear,\nblue eye, \"and I believe that it is happier\nhome, with some ambition and fixed purpose\nthan this wild, roaming about, in\nthis desultory nerve-straining way.\"\n\n\"Well, boy,\" said \"Budd\" with as much\nfeeling, \"I believe you're right. I have\ngambled all over the world, started out\nwhen I was sixteen, played monte in\nMexico, baccarat in France and keno in\nNew Orleans, worked transatlantic\nsteamers, county fairs, circuses and museums,\nbut I never yet in my life saw or\nheard tell of an active gambler who\nplayed for a living, got rich and continued\nto play who died rich, and a natural\ndeath. All I want is a good stake\nonce more before they close; the old wife\nhas been faithful to me, and I have promised\nher my children shall have a good\neducation. I'm yearnin', my lad, for a \nlarge, comfortable farm, where life and\nnature can make the end like a healthy\nsleep.\"\n\nJust then there was a loud whistle of\nthe postman and the name of Ferguson\nwas called. The old man hurriedly left\nthe room and came back smiling with a\nregistered letter. \"Well, I'll be durned,\"\nsaid \"Budd,\" looking at the handwriting\nwith tears in his eyes, \"ef it ain't from\nJennie,\" as he opened the envelope and\ndisplayed the picture of a beautiful\nwoman, intellectual and refined appearing,\nand upon the bottom of the picture\ncould be plainly seen in a bold, round\nhand the inscription, \"From your loving\nwife, Jennie.\" She's the queen of all the\nwomen I ever met,\" said he as he intently\n\nintently and affectionately looked at the\npicture and then transferred it to the\n\"Kid.\"\n\n\"Say,\" said the \"Kid,\" \"I got a letter\nfrom mother this morning, and, 'Budd,'\n\"no titled woman of royalty was ever\ngrander or nobler or truer than that dear\nsoul in old New York.\n\n\"Say, 'Budd,' \"these letters and this\npicture, tokens of two queens, coming at\nthis time, is quite a hunch, to play the\nqueen to-night, as a repeater, if we had a\nbank roll,\" he remarked apologetically.\n\n\"An' as for me,\" said \"Budd,\" laughingly,\n\"this is the only money I have, this\ndeuce, an' I intended to-. Well, never\nmind, better days are coming for both\nof us.\n\n\"I have an idea,\" said the \"Kid.\" \"Suppose\nwe take a chance with that phoney\nbill against the bank?\" The old man was\nnot so imprudent as his younger companion,\nand to this proposition showed\nsome hesitation. \"It will never do,\" said\nhe. \"Dalton would never get through\ntalking about it, and we can't afford to be\nknown as 'brace' players.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied the 'Kid,' \"but you\nwould only be serving him as he served\nyou. Here now, you needn't play. Leave\nit to me.\"\n\nStill the old man shook his head.\n\n\"Now, 'Budd,' don't be foolish. I'll\ntoss up this coin, heads we play and tails\nwe stand pat.\"\n\nThis gambling proposition was the\nstrongest argument the \"Kid\" could use.\n\"Budd\" could not withstand the temptation,\nassented and the coin was flipped up\nand fell \"heads up.\" The lowest check\nat Dalton's was five dollars, but the custom\nand rule of the house allowed the\nregulars in on a smaller margin.", "56", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00566", "442   Howard's American Magazine.\n\nLOUNGERS AT THE RED DRAGON.\n\nThe Queen of Hearts.   443\n\nOld Jack Sheperd was dealing, and\n\"Lightning Jim\" Stewart was in the\n\"look out chair,\" as the \"Kid,\" followed\nby his guilty-looking and embarrassed\ncompanion, approached the table.\n\nOwing to the small size of the bank\nroll, the \"Kid\" did not sit down, feeling\nthat his usual run of hard luck would soon\nexhaust his small capital. The \"Kid\"\nreached over to the layout and placed the\nfolded-up counterfeit note upon the\nqueen to win. The first queen, the second\nand then the third won, and at the\nlast turn the queen of hearts had not yet\nappeared. \"Last call, gentlemen,\" said\nJack Sheperd, \"five, six, queen.\"\n\n\"Five, queen, six,\" said the \"Kid,\"\ncalling the turn as he placed his whole\n\"bank roll\" upon the call.\n\n\"You've got your luck with you tonight,\"\nsaid Jack Sheperd, as he pushed\nthe five off the box and saw the queen of\nhearts follow.\n\n\"Don't mind me, Jack, I've got a new\nhunch.\" All that night the \"Kid\"\nplayed heavy, he stuck to the limit, and\nwhen inspiration moved him, he asked\nto have the limit raised.\n\nFor a while Jack Sheperd granted his\nrequest, but as bet after bet on the queen\nand high card was cashed, he finally refused\nto move the limit, as he expressed\nit, \"for even his brother.\"\n\nThe queens ran almost consecutively\nevery deal and dumb cards in their marvelous\nand symmetrical sequence seemed\nto understand and sympathize with the\nfeverish and nervous young man.

There was one escape \nfrom the menacing danger of his \ntriumph, so the white performer sought \n\nto compete with the real Negro in presenting \nthe characteristic parts that satisfied \nthe public, and his attempt at competition \nwas but a feeble, if not altogether \nfutile effort to imitate his brother in black. \nNo musical comedy now receiving public \napproval is complete but that is has the \nring of genuine and original Negro character \nin it, and the public demand of the \nwhite performer the ability to excel the \nblack professional in the delivery of this \nmuch-coveted style of amusement. \nIt is true that some lyrics to Negro \nsongs have been absolutely objectionable \nto the public, and have been subjected to \nrighteous condemnation. Syncopation, \nit is true, may be the product of the white \nwriter, but rag-time expression is the absolute \nclaim of the Negro author or crude \nperformer. For instance:\nhere is syncopation as handed down in theory.\nHere is rag-time as attempted by the white composer. \nNote in the following the real ragtime \nexpression in the first two bars of \nthis strain, that within the last half decade \nhas attracted the attention of the music loving world. \nThe trials, tribulations, sorrows, and \nexultations of the old Negro found satisfactory \nexpression in the weird songs that \nwere sent up from the cotton and rice \nfields of the benighted Southland. \n\nIs Rag-Time Music Dying? 449\n\nRag-time is not the only distinctive and \noriginal style of Negro music. The \nNegro has his grand or high-class music. \nNote \"Steal Away to Jesus.\"\nSteal a-way, steal a-way, Steal a-way to Je-sus;\nThis is a conception of the highest \norder of Negro soul-reaching music. \nWho has listed to \"Roll, Jordan, \nRoll,\" or \"Steal Away to Jesus,\" as rendered \nby the famous Fisk Jubilee Singers, \nwithout experiencing deep emotion. In \nfact, so peculiarly original is the music \nthat has come to us from the Negro plantation \nand meeting house, so entertaining \nto and coveted by all music lovers, that \nit would seem a crime against themselves \nif Negroes did not exercise their energy \nin an attempt to preserve intact the music \nthat inspired the original singers thereof \nto tune their torture-ridden souls to the \npeculiar music that became their own. \nAll the different nationalities, Germans, \nFrench, Swedish, Spanish, etc., have \ntheir singing societies to preserve and advance \nthe original music tha teach has \nreceived from the ages of their respective \npeoples. This feeling of race pride nurtured \nand fed in the musical reunions is \nrather akin to the old idea of the Greek \nnational unity in the Olympian games. \n\nThis idea of assembly is the foundation \nstone, not only of the family, but of the \nnation, and it may be generally remarked, \nwhat is a nation without fraternity and \nnational unity? It is at least a sad commentary \nupon our race that we have instituted \nno movement to preserve the \nmusic which is responsible to our folk. \nRivalry may crop out as to the voices \nthat must preserve this music intact, but \nwe must remember that the fountain \nsprings of this music came from the lowliest \nof our people. Singing societies \nshould be formed throughout the country \namong our people encouraging the \npreservation of our original music, so \nthat the future generations can attribute \nto us the authenticity of our characteristic \nmusic. Negro authors would be largely \nencouraged by the holding of these annual \ngatherings, and a new lease of inspiration \nwould be given to all who would \nexcel in the great art of contributing to \nthis most important branch of music. \nMany errors have been made by Negro \nsingers in ignoring the music of their \nrace. No white artist can equal the \nNegro singer in rendering Negro melodies. \nBut the idea of imitating the white", "60", 82, 82, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-028:00091", "ACID\nINDIGESTION\nEnjoy that\n\"FEEL\nBETTER\"\nFEELING\nTake\nALKA-\nSELTZER\nBRAND Reg.

Shortly before noon that day he had\nattended the second triennial meeting of the National Woman's\nCouncil. The meeting was held in what was then called Metzerott\nHall, but what is now known as the Columbia Theater. When one\nof the Council officers saw him etering, she announced from the\nplatform \"Frederick Douglass is in the house,: exactly as she\nwould have said \"The president is here.\" A committee was immediately\nappointed to escort Douglass to the platform, and when\nhe reached it, those white women gave him a royal Chatauqua\nsalute, waving their handkerchiefs vigorously in the air.\nWhen the meeting adjourned and the admiring women ceased\npaying homage to Douglass, which I enjoyed from a distance, I\ncame forward and greeted him. He and I left the hall and walked\ntogether to the corner of 12th and F Streets. There he stopped\nand asked me to have lunch with him. But I was not feeling\nvery well and declined the invitation. Lifting the large light sombrero\nwhich he often wore, Douglass bade me goodbye. That\nwas the last time I saw him alive.\nAbout seven o'clock that evening a friend, Walter Hayson, a\nhigh school teacher, came by our house to tell me and my husband\nthat Frederick Douglass was dead. He had died suddenly at dinner\nwhile telling his wife about the great ovation tendered him\nthat day by the National Woman's Council. I deeply regretted\nthat I did not go to lunch with him, that I had been unable to\nspend another hour in the company of a great man.\nHis funeral was held at the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church, of\nwhich he was a member. It was one of the biggest and most impressive\nfunerals Washington had ever seen. People of all classes\nand colors attended in thousands. Susan B. Anthony, the famous\nwomen's leader, was there, along with many other notables of the\nday. I almost did not get into the church. It took me over an\nhour to get inside, so great was the crowd come to mourn the\npassing of Douglass.\nI remember the funeral as though it happened yesterday. Mrs.\nDouglass entered the church wearing not mourning attire but a\nbrown fur cape. She did not believe in mourning. In not wearing\nblack she knew she was giving offense to many present, but she\nfollowed her convictions.\nJudged by any standard or test Frederick Douglass occupies\na distinguished place among the greatest Americans. To have\nknown that great man and to have been honored with his friendship\nI consider a priceless privilege, and one of the most cherished\nmemories of my life.\n\nBed on which Douglass slept is preserved as it usually appeared during his life.

Let us adhere to our national\nsphere. Negro performers can\nbetter act the parts of their own people\nthan the parts of Germans, Italians, Spaniards\nor French. Who will be the first\nto start this much-needed reform?\n\nIt might be said with much truth that\nno more correct dileneators of Negro\ndialect and melody can be found upon the\nAmerican stage than those two popular\nand justly celebrated performers, Bert\nWilliams and George Walker, of the firm\nof \"Williams & Walker.\" Their masterly\nconception of Negro song and character\nhas been justly rewarded by the\nAmerican public in a kindly recognition\nof their musical ability in the portrayal of\nNegro character.\n\nThe Negro occupies a unique and independent\nfield in theatricals; it is in his\npower to inaugurate an epoch which will\nredound to his eternal glory. White\nprofessional profit by application to their\nart; Negroes are content to rest upon past\naccomplishments. We must study, work\nhard, and excel, if we would be classed\namong the producers. The Negro actor\nmust interest himself in all the business\nand moral reforms instituted for the betterment\nof his people, and must participate\nin all the business, moral and industrial\nmovements that make for good.\n\nAs a rule, Negro actors and actresses\nresort to ridiculous disguisement in the\nextravagant use of powder and paints in\ntheir \"make-up.\" They display poor\ntaste in absolutely disguising themselves\nbeyond the point of recognition in their\nfrenzied efforts to look white. The artistic\n\nartistic is entirely lost to view, and the desire\nto appear grotesque destroys, in many\ncases, the finer professional instincts and\ntraining of the performer.\n\nThe Negro churches have kept themselves\naloof from the performer. They\nshould seek out young men and women\nwith shows, some of whom represent the\nbest colored families of the country, and\ntry to encourage them by extending the\nright hand of fellowship. There should\nbe a Negro performers' church alliance,\nthat should be equally upheld and encouraged\nby performers and churches.\nChurch directories and addresses of ministers\nand leaders of their societies should\nbe accessible to all performers entering\ntheir respective towns, for there are few\nperformers that do not desire to attend\nchurch when in a town.\n\nThe day is fast approaching when the\nNegro performer and the world will realize\nthat merit cannot go unrewarded; for\nmanagers are contemplating the launching\nof productions that will bring into\nplay talents that have been hidden by\nages of suppression, and dwarfed by lack\nof opportunity. Apropos of this idea the\nvery timely quotation from Othello would\nbetter illustrate our meaning:\n\n\"What care I if he be black?\nIf he be black and thereto have a wit,\nHe'll find a white his blackness fit.\"\n\nThus it appears from the above interview\nthat \"rag-time\" music is destined to\nmaintain its place in popular favor; and\nif the timely suggestion of Mr. Hogan be\nobserved by Negro performers, there can\nbe no doubt that new avenues and honors\nawait them.\n\nJ.

They were acquainted with the problems of family disorganization \ngrowing out of the fact that a tremendously large number of southern \nNegro mothers have to work. They knew of the ill health and delinquency \nwhich resulted from the bad housing conditions with Negroes have to \ncombat. They knew of other influences retarding the healthy growth of \nNegro children particularly in the rural sections where exist the problems \nof the Negro tenant farmer and they know the way in which even \nthe cities of the South, the care of dependent Negro children has either \nbeen entirely neglected or left to incompetent and sometimes dishonest \nindividuals and they know of the denial to the Negro of the facilities \nfor wholesome recreation.\n\nThey also knew that the most effective work in solving these \nproblems could be done by Negro social workers rather than by white social \nworkers, but they had found that Negroes trained in social work in the \nNorth were either absorbed in that section or did not care to come South. \n\nNUMBER OF YEARS THE SCHOOL HAS FUNCTIONED - 6.\nFINANCIAL SUPPORT OF THE SCHOOL SINCE ORGANIZATION. \n1920-24 - There was no budget for the first few years and consequently the \nSchool should not be judged too harshly during that period.

R. Wright, of the Georgia\nState Industrial College, and one of the\ntwo Negro paymasters of the army, during\nthe Spanish-American war, testified\nbefore the Industrial Commission in\nWashington on the question of industrial\neducation in the South.\n\nMr. Wright said that in the South at\nthe time of emancipation, not only was\nthe labor system revolutionized, but practically\nparalyzed for a time. For the five\nyears following the war the struggle over\nthe reconstruction of the States and the\nenfranchisement of the Negro not only\nkept labor in a chaotic condition, but so\nunnerved the white people of the South\nthat they did not begin the work of rehabilitation\nuntil 1870. Had the Government\ngiven the freed man his mule\nand forty acres of land rather than the\nballot, which he had now practically lost,\nboth ex-slave and ex-master would have\nbeen better off. The slave found himself,\nwithout an effort of his own, invested\nwith the privilege not only to hunt,\nfish and lounge around, as he had seen his\nfree master do, but with the right to talk\npolitics and vote. It was very natural\nthat the Negro, in his attempt to enjoy\nthese privileges, should have misused\nthem, and that he should have consented\nto be used by the carpet-baggers and\ntheir white associates as his only alternative,\nhis late masters being wholly unprepared\nto treat with him on any terms\nother than those of quasi slavery.\n\nMr. Wright was glad to say that there\nwas now practically peace and harmony\nbetween the races throughout the South.\nThe laboring population had never\nlearned the art of politics and were far\n\nless interested in them to-day than the\nwhite men who were striving to deprive\nthe Negro of the ballot.\n\nSpeaking of the conditions in Georgia\nMr. Wright said that from a landless,\nhomeless class of ex-slaves in 1865, the\nNegroes had now become taxpayers to the\namount of $14,118,720, including the\nownership of a million acres of farm land.\nThe greatest drawback and discouragement\nof the colored farmers was a lack\nof working knowledge of the soil and of\nimproved farming implements. There\nwas little or no effort to improve the colored\nfarmer. No farmers' institutes\nwere held among them and little or no\nagricultural literature reached them.\nBoth in field and barn the old methods of\nagriculture were still in vogue among\ncolored farm owners.\n\nWe do not agree with the sentiments\nof President Wright. The emancipation\nand its immediate consequences did not\nunnerve the whites and keep labor in a\nchaotic state. The fact is, the sudden\ncessation of free labor, and the solemn\nresponsibility of providing for themselves,\nafter a long subsistence by the\nsweat of other men's faces, brought about\ncommercial lethargy. It is always the\nrule that the thief when deprived of his\nill-gotten gains, will not only show resentment,\nbut malice. No man who has\nprofited by a wrong has ever felt kindly\ntoward the author of his detection or the\none who has furnished the evidence of\nhis guilt. We do not indorse the sentiments\nof those alleged leaders of our\npeople who enter up a plea of guilty, for\nthe Negro, by seeking compromise and\nthrowing themselves without warrant of\n\nEditor's Arm Chair.   459\n\nreason, logic or facts entirely upon the\nmercy of the court. There is too much\nof this question begging and weak-kneed\nsentiment, condemnation and excusemaking,\non the part of our alleged representatives\nthat glibly places the Negro entirely\nat the mercy of his detractors and\nthose who are only too glad to discredit\nhis record and possibilities, through such\nevidence of those who either know better\nor are utterly incapacitated to speak upon\nthe subject.\n\nWe do not believe the Government\nerred in giving the Negro the ballot any\nmore than it does now to the ignorant and\nunfriendly emigrants. That is the same\nold arguments of men like Tillman, Gordon,\nMorgan and Butler, and we are surprised\nwhen men of the intellectual calibre\nof Mr. Wright uses it. Such sentiments\nare not only false and untrue, when\nexpressed by that class of gentlemen, in\nseeking to convince by sincerity and honesty,\nbut are vicious in the extreme and\nare quoted as being the evidence of reputable\nwitnesses and representative men,\nby those who are inclined to do us harm.\n\nIf the Negro had divided in his political\nallegiance, if he had ignored his\nfriends, and succored his enemies, there\nwould not have been any hue and cry,\nthere never would have been any race\nproblem in this country to solve. No one\nfears the illiterate Irish, German, Pole\nor Bohemian vote. The entire responsibility\nof illiteracy in this country is\nheaped upon the shoulders of the Negro.\nWe do not believe the Government should\nhave given him forty acres and a mule,\nfor there are less paupers among Negroes\nthan any race of people on earth,\nand that he \"hunted and fished and\nlounged around,\" as the gentleman loquaciously\n\nloquaciously explained, as the taxable property,\nprosperity, wealth per capita of Negroes,\nin Southern States conclusively\ndisprove. We can not understand by\nwhat process of reasoning men of our\nrace, in a position to do much good, arrive\nat such disastrous, fallacious and harmful\nconclusions. The facts do not warrant\nit and certainly race pride and sympathy\nshould not permit it. We doubt\nat times if they are sincere, and wonder if\nthese specious arguments are not sometimes\nresorted to, to gain the confidence\nof their hearers, at the expense of their\npeople. No man, in the face of the direct\nevidence before him, relative to the Negro\nproblem, who utters such sentiments can\neither be honest with himself or the\npeople he pretends to represent. The\ngentleman further maintains the old Confederate\nargument about carpet-baggers,\nwhereas, those gentlemen, the carpet-\nbaggers, were sincere, loyal friends\nof the Negro and were naturally despised\nand maligned for the cause and country\nthey upheld.\n\nHe further alleges that there is peace\nand harmony between the races, whereas\nevery one, North and South, who reads\nthe daily papers, knows this to be false.\nAnd is this last statement as true and in\ncomport with other portions of his argument?\nIs the above representations made\nwith the sincerity of conscientious conviction?\nIs it honest or made for a purpose?\nIs it hypocritical, designing or\nknavish? Such errors and misstatements\nare so palpable and unreasonable\nthat one is forced to believe that there is\nsome sinister intention in the mind of him\nwho makes them.

But what could I do? All at once I made up my mind to\nleave the train. I had heard the conductor announce that the next stop\nwould be Erie, Tennessee, where passengers going to certain destinations\nwould have to change cars. I decided to get off there, wire my plight to\nmy father and await instructions from him.\nI was well aware that I was taking a desperate chance. I knew\nthat any colored girl would run a great risk of having an unpleasant\nexperience or of falling into some kind of danger by getting off at night at a\nstrange town in the South, where she could not get a room in a hotel, was\nacquainted with nobody and where she might be unable to find a decent\nplace to stay. But of the two evils, I decided that leaving the train was\nthe less. When we reached Erie, therefore, I took my valise and started\ntoward the door. But the conductor was there before me and refused to let \nme pass. \"What are you going to do?\" he asked. \"I am getting off here\". I\nreplied, \"to wire my father that you are forcing me to ride all night in a\nJim Crow car. He will sue the railroad for compelling his daughter who has\na first class ticket to ride in a second class car.\" \"Do you know where\nyou are going?\" he inquired. \"Do you require all the passengers who leave\nthe train to tell you their business?\" I countered. When the conductor\nsaw how determined I was not to remain on the train, he tried to wrench\nmy valise from my hand, but I held onto it with a vise-like grip. When\nhe saw he was attracting the attention of some passengers in the next car\nwho were coming toward the door, he let go of my valise.  Then I went\ninto the first class coach and took a seat in the center of the car on\nthe verge of collapse. But I reached Memphis all right the next morning.\nAgain I call attention to the fact that if there had been a Jim Crow car\nlaw in Tennessee I would have been obliged to remain in it helpless all\n6\nnight.\nA number of colored women have been beaten and put in jail\nduring the last few years because they refused to go into the Jim Crow car.\nNot long ago two colored women employed by the United States Government\nboarded a bus in Washington to go to the department in which they worked\nwhich was located in nearby Virginia because of the crowded condition of\nthe National Capital. When they reached the Virginia State line the operator\nof the bus ordered them to move from the seat in which they had been\nsitting and go back to the Jim Crow portion of the bus. They refused to\ndo this. The bus operator called a policeman who took them from the bus\nand put them in jail where they remained until their friends heard of\ntheir plight and secured their release.\nThere is an interstate law which, crudely expressed, provides\nthat if you buy a railroad ticket in a place where there is no Jim Crow\nlaw, you can not be forced into a Jim Crow car when you reach a State\nwhere that law is in force. But that law is cleverly evaded by having the\nconductor or the operator of a bus notify a police officer who arrests\nthe colored passenger for violating the State law. No pen can describe and\nno tongue can portray the indignities, insults, and assaults to which colored\nwomen have been and still are being subjected in Jim Crow cars. If I should\ndare to relate some of the things which have happened, many would not\nbelieve me, and very serious objections to publishing them in a magazine\nwould probably be raised.\nThe first time I realized the ordeal through which colored women\npass who are stranded at night in a strange city was when I was traveling\nfrom Shreveport, Louisiana to Paris, Texas. I was told the train\nwould reach Paris that night. Since I knew I would be on the road all\nday I boarded the white coach.

The old civilization abounds in\ndespotism, evil and injustice. Walking\nin ignorance and living in penury, her millions\ntoil in slavery to die at a master's\nbidding. There is little joy under such\na rule. The new civilization is rich in\nfreedom, good, and justice. With privileges\nof education, with equal opportunity\nto labor, her people may win distinction\nand rank. Under such conditions there\nis enjoyment.\n\nThese are the forces between which the\nbattle lies. Let us consider, then, the\nrelative strength of the two forces; let us\nfind where there is most of good and least\nof evil. Time alone will prove which\nshall be the conqueror. But if there be\nlaw in history, if the best shall win because\nit is the strongest, the fittest survive\nbecause it is the mightiest, we shall anticipate", "89", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00599", "556 Howard's American Magazine.\n\nanticipate victory for that system which offers\nopportunity for the widest happiness and\nlargest usefulness to the race.\n\nOriental civilization lives in the past.\nIts golden age is but a tradition. The\nOriental mind follows, with religious devotion,\ncustoms and laws are the product\nof bygone ages. For every policy,\nthere must be a precedent; for every habit,\na custom; for every belief, an ancestral\nchain of thought. Manifestly, its institutions\nare passive. The older the idea the\nmore secure its perpetuity. To the Oriental,\nwhose policy cares more for the\ndead than for the living, agitation is\nheresy and reform is desecration. Thus\nthe East lives, not for the good of the future,\nbut for the emulation of the past.\n\nOccidental civilization lives for the\nfuture and makes of the present a period\nof intense activity. It studies the past\nthat it may theorize and experiment for\nthe future. Breaking away from obsolete\nforms it tries new ideals and the\nradical triumphs over the conservative.\nNot a ripple disturbed the sluggish life of\nChina and India until British commerce\nover-reached its bounds of sea and wall.\nCivilization, centering in marts that thrill\nwith trade, naturally follows the paths of\ncommerce. Around the Mediterranean\nonce centered the wisdom of the world.\nTo-day it belongs not to one sea or one\nland. The merchant marine dispatches\nmessengers to every shore and trans-continental\nrailways deny isolation to every\nportion of the globe. Distance is little\nhindrance; nature offers few obstacles;\nthe elements are servants. Man's mastery\nof earth's forces is the result of activity -\nthe result of ever toiling that the\nfuture may be better than the past. This\n\ndominant motive of the Western world\nhas transformed every avenue of thought.\nIt brought religion out of superstition,\ngovernment out of despotism, science out\nof sorcery, civilization out of barbarism.\nIn religion, it taught the race the fatherhood\nof God and the brotherhood of man;\nin government, it took the power from\nabsolutism and diffused it among the\nmasses; in science, it freed human hands\nand enslaved the tireless forces of nature;\nin society, it decreed a reign of law\nwhere every genius might invent, every\nteacher might instruct, every reformer\nmight hold aloft his ideals of unaccepted\ntruth.\n\nOriental civilization is unprogressive\nand local. Offering the same institutions\nto each age and each people, it neglects\nto account for the variance in national\ncharacteristics and racial habitations.\nTo the modern race, that in the drifted\nsnow has nurtured the flower of civilization,\nit grants the precepts followed by\nthe patriarchs of Asia's provinces of a\nthousand years ago. Instead of its elements\npermitting of modification to meet\nnew conditions, in new climes, this civilization\nstrives to impel conditions to conform\nto obsolete standards, and thus\nblocks progress. Under the shadow of\nsuperstition its worshippers bow at altars\nwhose fires have long since gone out, and\nthrough the gloom overspreading the\nblinded multitude there shines no ray of\nhope.\n\nOccidental civilization is progressive\nand universal. No race can live which\ndoes not have progress and the extension\nof its blessings to the future, as its dominating\nthought. Ages ago while the races\nof Shakespeare and Goethe roamed in\nbarbaric bands through the forest of\n\nThe Orient and the Occident.    557\n\nwestern Europe, the valleys of the Ganges\nand Yangtse Kiang teemed with the bounties\nof a civilization unrivalled. But that\ncivilization remained in the valley and its\nruins are its only monument. While the\nold civilization widened not its boundaries\nthe restless spirit of Teutonic tribes, with\nindomitable courage visited vast possessions\nand formed new governments. Its\nelements modified to meet the conditions\nof every age and land. This spirit has\ngrown until modern commerce pauses at\nno boundary lines. It traverses every\nsea, crosses every continent, and in its\npath follows modern culture. Under the\nstars of every clime it makes its conquests,\nand thus through commercial thrift and\nindustrial activity come the freer thought\nand more highly-developed material conditions,\nand thus do the opportunities\nvouchsafed by this system become the\nheritage of the world.\n\nBetween these civilizations the world\nmust choose. The unification of the race\ndemands that there shall be but one civilization,\nthat the purposes of men harmonize,\nand the elements of antagonism be\neliminated. Thus far the modern world\nhas triumphed. It must be so. Accept\nthe basic principle of the old civilization\nand you would put away the annals of\nthe last four hundred years. Superstition\nwould return and gone forever would\nbe the age of humanity. No heroic deeds,\nno proud victories would render immortal\nan age or a people; unknown this\nmighty humanity, shrouded in a dream -\nin a night without a star! Accept the\nbasic principle of the new civilization and\nthe race awakes to action. In it lies the\nhope of the world. Actuated by its spirit\nthe patriot forever sacrifices himself to\nthe common good. Those who checked\n\nthe Turk's advance against it; those who\nwon for it the sovereignty of the oceans;\nthe conquerors at Yorktown and Appomattox;\nthe heroes who, upon the heights\nof the Antilles, wrote in characters of\nblood the doom of the last despot on the\nWestern Continent call upon the coming\ngeneration to transmit with undying devotion\nthe heritage they fought so hard\nto preserve. \n\nThe new, then, will dominate because\nit is active, it lives for the future, it is\nfitted for an universal civilization. The\nstory will not all be written until this system\nhas a meaning in the life of every\nnation. For all, not for the new, has its\ngenius burned, its machinery multiplied,\nits territory expanded. In the world's\nlife one part is dependent upon another,\ninjury to one race affects all. The duty\nof the new is not \"splendid isolation,\" but\nsplendid sacrifice, splendid service. Society\nshould advance not by a revolutionary\nleveling down but by an evolutionary\nleveling up of unequal conditions. This\nprogress will come under the sunshine of\npeace if possible, but under the leveling\nstorm cloud of war if necessary. The\nmustering of the Powers in China rendered\nfutile the efforts of resistance to the\ninfluence of Western thought and taught\nthe Eastern empire respect for the principles\nof law and order that constitute\nthe worth of Western government and institutions.\nWhy the hovering of war\nclouds over dark Africa and dead Asia -\nthose lands where once centered the\nworld's culture?

They owned the greater part of\nthe wealth, represented the industry and\npower of this nation, had made possible\nthe establishment of the Constitution,\nand stood behind it; conservative, moderately\nwell-to-do and strong in their determination\nto preserve the democratic\ncharacter of its institutions. Our first\nand best presidents, the great triumvirate\nof statesmen, Webster, Calhoun\nand Clay; the soldier Grant and the martyred\nLincoln, all were reared amidst the\nrugged simplicity of farm life. As late\nas 1860 four-fifths of our population still\nlived outside of cities, stil owned four-sevenths\nof the national wealth, still supplied\nthe nation with her ablest men, still\nwere happy and prosperous.\n\nThe thirty years following the Civil\nWar saw this condition of affairs entirely\nchanged. In the United States during\nthis period the urban population increased\nfrom one-fifth to one-third of the whole\npeople, and cities progressed in wealth\nfour times as rapidly as rural communities.\nFrom governmental affairs the\nwell-to-do farmer, secure and confident\nin the honor and dignity of his vocation,\nall but disappeared. As we look back\nto the long period between the birth of\nthe Republic and the Civil War, when\nthe farmer stood so strong in the land,\nand contrast his past with his present condition,\nwe can not but ask: What were\nthe causes which wrought this remarkable \nchange? What the effect of this\nchange upon our institutions? is it not\npossible and desirable that in the coming\nyears the farmer of the United States\nshould win back some of his old prosperity\nand power?\n\nSixty years ago there was very little\nfarming west of Ohio, and nearly all the\nwork was done by hand. Since then the\nrailroad systems have been extended from\nocean to ocean and to every corner of the\nRepublic. Since then the Mississippi\nvalley, one of the most productive regions \nof the earth, the wheat-bearing\nplains of the Middle States, and the great\nwind-swept prairies to the north, all have\nbeen opened for cultivation. Into this\ngreat agricultural country people and\nwealth have poured from every quarter\nof the globe. Since 1840 has come the\nintroduction of labor saving machinery,\nincreasing the efficiency of farm labor\nthree-fold. To-day, one man with a harvester\nis worth three of his grandfather's\ntime with a cradle. These factors led to\nsuch an abundance of agricultural products,\nthat in twenty-fours years, 1871 to \n1895, the price of wheat fell from $1.25 to\n50 cents a bushel. In consequence an\nenergetic people of thrift and industry\nwas reduced to penury.\n\nGo back again to the early days before\nthe nation was burdened with the complex\nand intricate systems of cities. The\nfarmer, content with his simple life, remained\nto solve the social and political\nproblems of his native community. It\nwas only when a great crisis demanded\nit that he girded himself for conflict, like\nCincinnatus of old, and went forth to\nserve the nation in whatsoever office he\nwas needed. Strangely different are\nconditions to-day. For sixty years the\nrural population of the New England\n\nThe Farmer 567\n\nand Atlantic States has been deceasing,\nand farm homes and country villages,\nonce the scene of energetic life, have been\nabandoned to ruin. At the same time\nthe people settling the Middle States and\nWest, because of the financial depression\nand the hardships and the absorbing cares\nof the development of a new country,\nhave failed to build up again the old farm\nlife and to rear again the old conservative\npower.\n\nWhile the agricultural part of the nation\nwas laboring under these adverse\nconditions, powerful forces were drawing\npopulation and wealth to cities. During\nthe decades following the Civil War,\nwoolen and cotton mills, iron works, the\ngreat implement factories and packing\nhouses rose as if by magic in the cities\nof the Eastern and Middle States. Machinery\nand the division of labor have \ntended to concentrate industry and population.\nEspecially since 1860, the manufacturing\nand commerce of the nation\nhave been encouraged and built up,\nThese industrial forces and the social advantages\nwhich man so eagerly craves,\nall have been drawing the population\nfrom farms to cities.\n\nThe causes, then, which have brought\nabout the great movement have been the\nunprecedented fall in the price of agricultural \nproducts, the privation and hardship \nof rural life and the industrial and social\nadvantages of cities. Now, what has\nbeen the effect of the crowding together\nof the population upon the general drift\nand development of American national \nlife? Since the moderately well-to-do \nof cities are passing away before the oncoming\nmarch of centralized wealth, city\nlife is tending to develop two classes; the\none, wealthy, inclining toward an aristocracy;\nthe other, the populace, owning no\nproperty, living from hand to mouth, inclining \ntoward revolution; each, equally \ndangerous to the Republic. The movement\nhas all but destroyed the power and \nmoderate conservatism of the great farm\npopulation, neither rich nor poor, but independent,\nincorruptible, loving democratic \nways and forming the only sure\nbasis of a democratic nation.\n\nHaving traced this so dominant tendency\nof our national life since 1860, how\nnatural to ask: Will these conditions\ncontinue? Will the forces which during\nthe last forty years produced such low\nprices and such multitudes of idle men\non farms intensify and deepen? Are no \nother economic forces now at work, the\noperation of which will bring back prosperity\nto the agricultural classes and stop\nthe flood of population to cities? Is\nthere no hope that the time will soon be\nhere when the farmer again shall exercise\nthe same influence in industrial and governmental\naffairs as in the early years of\nthe Republic?\n\nMust we look far for an answer? The\narea of the agricultural lands in the world\nis fixed in amount, is now almost occupied,\nand is fast approaching the limit of\nits productivity. The old World is now\ntilled almost to its full capacity. Siberia,\nAustralia, Central and Southern Africa,\nArgentine and Uruguay will probably\nnever produce agricultural products in\nquantities sufficient to affect the world \nsupply. There has been a complete\nchange in the condition of affairs in the\nUnited States since 1850. We then had\na great empty country with a small population.\nWe were then on the eve of the\ngreat inventions and of the great migrations\nof populations toward the west.

Mastered by a pride of intellect,\ndirected by an inflexible will, he marshals\nmen and events with cunning genius\nand heartless cruelty.  The mainspring\nof his action is in his cold, sleepless intellect,\nand the source of his power is his\nfiendish skill in giving direction to another's\nthoughts.  Unlike Macbeth, Iago is\ncontrolled by reason, not by feeling.  For\nhim to think, means for him to act, and \nfor him to act, means the employment of\nthe arts of hell in damning men.

His belief in the supernatural\nis supreme, but his distorted mind\nsees not angels of light, but demons of\ndarkness.  He shows his wickedness\nlargely in his weakness, and by his weakness,\nmakes himself the victim of circumstance.\n\"Time and the hour runs\nthrough the roughest day,\" making wild\nsport of his better qualities, turning his\nlove into hate, his hope into despair, enlisting\nhis courage and ambition as inspired\nministers of his crime.  While he\ntakes his cue from the witches and his\ndirection from the pointing dagger, yet he\never hears the still small voice that warns\nhim to \"proceed no further in the bloody\nbusiness.\"  But Macbeth stands alone;\nhe finds no help from without; he hears \nno hopeful voice above the storm.  But\nrather amid the raging tumult of his soul,\nhe catches the cutting jeer of his wife: \n\"Was the hope drunk wherein you dressed\nyourself?--When you durst do it, then\nyou were a man.\"  Circumstance, friends, \n\nhell, are in league against him.

In an unfortunate number of instances\nalthough these young people formerly intended to return to\nschool to acquire as thorough an education as possible\nthey have decided not to do so for a variety of reasons.\nSome of them are being told that after all an education\nis not necessary so as to make a living and achieve success.\n[Parents] Adults who have done well in life without scholastic\ntraining tell [their children] young people they can do the same thing.\nThere are Jim Jones and Sam Smith, they say, [who\nas you know have made thousands] Both of these men have made fortunes and neither one of\nthem ever went to school a day in his life  And if you can do the same thing  And this\nargument naturally makes a deep impression upon young\npeople people who have succeeded very well without an education\nBut these good people forget that competition is much\nkeener today than it was when they started on their careers\nThe man who succeeded without an education thirty years\nago would probably find failure staring him in the face\nif he attempted to do the same thing today.  The men who laid\nthe foundation of mammoth fortunes in New York and other\nplaces fifty years ago would [very likely] probably be unable to do the same\nthing today with no more mental and financial equipment\nthan they possessed at that time.

Colored women should cultivate the habit of \nwriting letters to their Congressmen urging them to vote for measures which are \njust and will advance the interests of their race. Let no one make you believe \nthat writing letters to your Congressmen will do no good. Congressmen read letters \nwritten to them and when a large number of letters are received urging \nthem to vote for a certain measure it makes an impression upon them and certainly \ninduces to favor a bill whose passage many of their constituents request.\nIt would be interesting to know how many of our women wrote to their \nCongressment, either as individuals or as organizations, urging them to vote for \nthe Fair Employment Practices Committee, which the Congress now in session \nbludgeoned to death.

The first serious land battle\ntook place on the Yalu on the first of May.\nThe gray dawn of that Sabbath morning\nwitnessed a frightful conflict between the\ntwo armies.  General Kuroki, who commanded\nthe Japanese, had, during Saturday\nnight, forced a passage of the Yalu river,\nand when morning came the Russians made\na vigorous defense of their position.  The\nJaps were full of enthusiasm.  They advanced\nin solid column, wading across the\nIho river, a small stream between them and\nthe enemy, and completely routed the Russians.\nThe Russians fled towards Feng-Wang-Chang,\nleaving about twenty-eight\nfield guns and large stores of provisions on\nthe field.  The Japs followed the victory up,\ndriving the Russians from Feng-Wang-Cheng,\nand administering a crushing defeat.\nThe Russians lost in killed and wounded \n3,000 men, while the enemy lost only 1,000.\nIt has now become evident that almost the\nentire Liao-Tung peninsular is overrun by\nthe Mikado's troops.

L. Diggs\n\nIn the January issue of The North American\nReview, Dr. Thomas Nelson Page contributes\nan article on \"The Lynching of\nNegroes - Its Cause and its Prevention.\"\n\nA careful reading of the first paragraph \nleads one to expect a broad and accurate,\nif not an impartial, treatment of the subject;\nfor the writer admits that the habit of\nclassing all Negroes as of one grade is misleading\nand unfortunate. If, however, we\nnote the spirit of the article it seems clear\nthat the eminent southerner does the Negro\na greater injustice than those persons whose\nfalse classification he mildly condemns. He\ndoes the \"respectable and law-abiding element\namong the Negroes\" a very great\nwrong when he says in the same article that:\n\n\"A close following of the instances of rape\nand lynching and the public discussion consequent\ntherein; has led the writer (Dr.\nPage) to the painful realization that even\nthe leaders of the Negro race, at least those\nwho are prominent enough to hold conventions\nand write papers on the subject - have\nrarely, by act or word, shown a true appreciation\nof the crime of ravishing and murdering\nwomen. Their discussion and denunciation\nhave been almost invariably and exclusively\ndevoted to the crime of lynching.\nUnderlying most of their protests is the suggestion\nthat the victim is innocent and a\nmartyr. Now and then there is a mild generalization\non the evil of law-breaking and\nthe violation of women; but for one stern\nword of protest against violating women and\ncutting their throats the records of Negro\nmeetings will show many against the attack\nof the mob on the criminal. And as to any\nserious and determined effort to take hold of\nand stamp out the crime that is blackening\nthe entire Negro race today, and arousing\nagainst them the fatal, and possibly the\n\nundying hatred of the stronger race, there\nis, with the exception of the utterances of\na few score of individuals, like Booker\nWashington, who always speaks for the\nright, Hannibal Thomas and Bishop Turner,\nhardly a trace of such a thing. A crusade\nhas been preached against lynching, even as\nfar as England; but none has been thought\nof against the ravishing and tearing to pieces\nof white women and children.\"\n\nWe quote the above in full so that no injustice\nmay be done Dr. Page. Now let us\nexamine the quotation. In the first place,\nDr. Page is utterly wrong in his painful realization (?)\nthat the Negroes who control\nconventions and write papers have rarely\nshown, by act or deed, a true appreciation\nof the enormity of the crime of ravishing\nand murdering women. It is plain that this\neducated southerner is ignorant of the utterances,\nacts and life of the very class of\nmen and women whom he so strangely misrepresents.\nIf he desires to know the sentiment\nof our intelligent men and women,\nlet him read the minutes of our great religious,\nphilanthropic, economic and literary\norganizations; let him acquaint himself with\nthe work of the great Baptist conventions,\nMethodist conferences and other like bodies;\nlet him read \"The United Negro: His\nProblems and His Progress;\" let him study\nthe reports of the Atlanta conferences; let\nhim acquaint himself with the literature of\nthe American Negro Academy; let him attend\nlectures by Negro scholars; let him\njoin us in doing fit honor to men like Bishop\nTurner and Professor Booker T. Washington,\nbut let him cease to extol such traitors\nto our race and such vile slanderers of\nNegro women as William Hannibal Thomas.\nIndeed it is by no means complimentary to\nDr. Page that he should praise this man\n\nIS IT IGNORANCE OR SLANDER   229\n\nwho would probably have remained unknown\nbut for his general, illogical and scurrilous\ndiatribe against the womanhood of the\nNegro race, for this attack is made the\nbasis; by Dr. Page, for classing this \"freak\nof nature\" with such illustrious men as the\neloquent and learned Bishop Turner and the\ncool, calculating and conservative Dr.\nWashington. If Dr. Page really knew\nsome of our Negro thinkers, something of\ntheir life and work, of their struggle to raise\nthe unfortunate and untrained of our race\nabove the base and low things of life; if he\nknew of our mothers' organizations, young\nwomen's Christian associations, literary circles\nand many other like organizations having\nthe highest moral aims, and constantly\nurging upon the Negro people, the highest\nethical principles, he would have long hesitated\nbefore attempting to misrepresent\nfrom his high vantage ground, the strong,\nhopeful and worthy womanhood and manhood\nof nine millions of native-born fellow\ncountrymen. It is never quite safe to discuss\npublicly questions upon which we are\nnot well informed.\n\nBishop C. K. Nelson, D. D. (white,) of\nGeorgia, in speaking of the Atlanta conference\nof 1902, says: \"High ground was\ntaken at the outset and maintained throughout.\nAs an exhibition of right thinking,\nthe congress was most creditable; as a rally\nof the best elements of heart and brain in \nbehalf of a people's fundamental needs, the\noccasion was a phenomenon that cannot\nescape the attention and support of all right\nthinking people.\"\n\nEditor Howell, of the Atlanta Constitution\nsays, on the first page of the above\nquoted work: \"From August 6 to August\n11 Atlanta has been filled with representatives\nof the race who, in themselves are the\nbest illustrations of the possibilities for the\nfuture. After seeing them, after hearing\nthe addresses of the leaders and noting not\nonly the earnestness, but intelligence displayed\nin dealing with the great problems\n\nfor the elevation of the race one cannot but\nbe optimistic with regard to the future.\nEarnest, God-fearing, intelligent men and\nwomen are devoting their best efforts to the\nbetterment of their race, and they show in\nthemselves what has been, and what will\nbe accomplished through education and the\npractical applications of the principles of\nChristianity.\"\n\nBishop W. A. Chandler, of the Southern\nMethodist church, who attended the congress,\nsays it seemed to him that uncommon\nwisdom and grace characterized the\nbody.\n\nProfessor Walter B. Hill, LL. D., chancellor\nof the University of Georgia, and one\nof the most learned men of our country, attended\nthe conference. In the annals of\nthe American Academy of Political and\nSocial Science for September, 1903, p. 84,\nhe says: \"The most vivid concrete illustration\nof the progress of the Negro in\nhigher education was the Negro Young\nPeople's Christian and Educational Conference\nat Atlanta, Ga., August 6 to 11. . . A\npessimist who doubted the progress of the\nNegro race would have been convinced\nagainst his will by witnessing the convention\nand reflecting that only thirty-seven\nyears had elapsed since these people were\nunlettered slaves.\"\n\nWe respectfully submit that these are\nopinions of prominent and representative\nsouthern men whose word ought to have\nweight. They differ from Dr. Page in that\nthey visited this great gathering of more\nthan eight thousand representative Negroes,\nsaw and were convinced. Perhaps we will\nbe pardoned for commending Professor Hill's\nwise words to Dr. Page's special study.\n\nIn The Saturday Evening Post of February\n27, 1904, another eminent and loyal\nsouthern scholar is at variance with our\ncritic.

Surely\nas you wind your way down Fifth\nAvenue, amid the wealth and fashion,\nyou must perforce conclude that there\nis no poverty at least, in New York.\nNo poverty, do you say?  and yet I\nhave seen a man full grown, able bodied,\nbut with stooping head and shoulders,\n-not the stoop of excessive work or of infirmity,\nbut the stoop of abandoned self-respect\nand wretched illness.  I have seen\nsuch a man unkempt and unclean reach down\ninto a garbage barrel for food; and this I\nhave seen in the Metropolis of America.\nYou must not judge New York by its fashion\nand its business if you wish to know its\ninfluence upon the inarticulate masses of\nits citizenship.  To learn this influence\naright, you must go into the tenement districts,\nyou must go to the sweat-shops, you\nmust go to the dock-yards, to the places of\nmisery, the haunts of vice, to the police\ncourts.  Here you get another side of\nthe picture, and when you have seen both,\nyou wonder how two such extremes exist\nwithin the limits of one city's life.  In the\ntenement houses sixteen people, men, women\nand childres are frequently found to\nexist in a single room.  These tenement\nbuildings are large and imposing, but once\nyou pass the entrance, the delusion of\ngrandeur vanishes.  The air reeks with disintegrated\nrefuse, the death-dealing foulness\nis everywhere.  Humanity takes on\nanother aspect; children are no longer children\n\nTHE FARMER AND THE CITY FOLK           239\nin the sweet sense that they are innocent\nand pure and upward looking.  Ever\nsince their baby eyes saw the light, they\nhave seen the darkness of sin.  These children\ncome into action upon life's scene debased\nand debauched in a way inconceivable \nto one who has lived his life under\nGod's skies, close to the earth and the trees\nand the birds.\nKeen competition and trade unions too\noften operate against even the willing workman\nin the cities.  The numberless strikes \nand lockouts, which seem designed to promote\nthe prosperity of the walking delegate,\ncut off the high wages and in the\nplace of peace and security, there are riots\nand bloodshed and the trade unions, though\nbased upon the principle of humane treatment\nto the laboring man, are loudest in\nvulgar and ignorant, but strangely effective\ndenial to the black man of the right to work\n-the most elemental of rights.  This is\nnot true in most cities of the Lower South.\nTrade unions have yet to bring this inconsistency\nto New Orleans and Mobile.\nToday and for a few years past, the large\ncities, realizing the degredation and suffering\nof their herded population, have been\nendeavoring to institute gardens on the vacant\nlots in and about the city to give\nhealthful occupation to the children of the\npoor.  The public schools are using part of\nthe play grounds for gardens, planted and\ncultivated by the children to induce a love\nof nature and of farm pursuits.  A leading\nfeature nowadays of kindergarten work is\ngardening.  The prettiest picture I ever\nsaw, was a bevy of little children leaving\nthe school-room with its songs and plays, \nhurrying eagerly with dancing step and\nmerry laughter to the garden spot begun by\nthem, and day by day watching with eager\ninterest its gradual development to full fruition.\nChildren whose lives are lived thus\nto manhood, will not be scoffers and doubters,\nbut will be reverent and sympathetic\nand noble.  Many cultivated people of\nwealth are going back to rural life for sunshine\nand freedom, that their children may \nlive the wholesome life that can not be\nfound or lived in the cramped surroundings\nof a city.  They want for their children\nless of the sordiness and greed of city life\nand they know that the country alone affords\nthe broader living.\nThe farm calls forth the best that is in \n\nman; it demands of him who would be successful,\nresearch and thought and definite\nplanning.  The failures among farmers are\nmore often due to ignorance than to slothfulness.\nThe farmer has yet, perhap, to realize\nhis opportunities.  That he is coming\nto do so is a beneficient sign of the times.\nIgnorance and unthrift will wreck the man\nat the head of a bank in a great city, not\nmore fatally than it will the farmer.  The\nvirtues of foresight, thrift, economy and\nthe intellectual power that education gives,\nare as necessary to the farmer as to the\nmanager of a great factory.  The reason\nthat the farmer has often been unsuccessful\nand unhappy is that he has not used his\nbrains.  A little plot of land for a garden,\na cow, a few chickens and a few pigs make\na farmer practically independent of the corner\ngrocery.  A little more land for a\nmarketable crop, cotton for the south, with\nindustry and devotion, will soon make the\nindustrious farmer's family independent.\nCountry life is wholesome with its fresh\nvegetables, its pure milk, its broad fields,\nits sunshine, its wonderful skies.  There is\never an inspiration in the growing crops,\nevery stage of which from the turning of\nthe soil to the garnering of the crops is full\nof interest.  Our finer instincts are thus\naroused.  Greater respect for all life is developed.\nA juster view of man and his \nrights is gained, new proportions are won.\nThe cramped views,, the distorted vision\nwhich grows out of the contests and struggles\nof city life, the merciless competition\nmet on every hand, the driving force of necessity\nand the vain desire to outdo ones\nfellows do not bring either ease or comfort\nor evolve the graces of life.  After a hard\nday's work in a suffocating factory or a\ndingy cellar, and the evening spent in a\nstuffy room where the sunlight never penetrates,\none could scarcely be expected to\nthink noble thoughts and do noble deeds.\nIt is this mad rush in the cities, this merciless\nwarfare that crushes out the finer instincts,\nthat makes misanthropes and criminals.\nThe school teacher can in a thousand\nways, develop in her pupils a love for the\ncountry, but the school teacher must first\nrise to the appreciation of what the better\nor higher country life is.

We\ncould make him understand nothing - he\nwas dead stupid. At first we thought he\nwas still asleep, but it soon dawned upon\nus that he was doped with opium. His\nface was old and wrinkled and tapered\nsharply at the chin, and his eyes, so much\nof them as we could see, were colorless and\nwithout light. Indignation at being aroused\nfrom his slumbers, appeared to be the only\ndiscoverable thing in the face and mutterings\nof the great man of Dagupan. His\nparting salutation was a muffled grunt and\na slight inclination of his rigid back.\n\nThere is a small barrio from Dagupan,\nfamous for its Filipino hats, which are almost\nas pretty and durable as the panama,\nand we wished to get a dozen of them for\nfriends in the States. We rode all over the\nplace and looked at all sorts of hats and\nfound many of the finest quality, but we\ncould buy none. The dear native thinks\nthat Americans are gold mines, and charge\n\nprices for everything exhorbitantly ridiculous.\nThese people wanted us to pay from\n$5 to $40 for hats that they sell ordinarily\nfrom fifty cents to $3 (Mexican currency).\nWhen we found that they were trying to\ndo us, we refused to buy any hats at all.\nWhen they discovered this and found we\nwere departing the barrio, we could have\nbought all the hats in the place, I believe,\nfor $40 in gold. A Filipino appears to have\nno idea whatever, of values or distances.\n\nWe left Dagupan by rail the next morning\nat 9 o'clock, stopping off at Bayambang.\nHere we found a large number of Negroes\nwho had been engaged on Government\nworks but were out of employment and\nfearful of the future, because of the suspension\nof the works; there being no sort of\nwork an American can do, or will do, outside\nof government employ. This is much\nthe same all over the Philippines. Agriculture\nis the only sort of employment outside\nof Manilla that I saw, and that was\nprimitive to the last degree, as I only saw\none steel plow - no hoe and no ax in a distance\ncovered of 700 miles. The bolo (a\n\nA Fine Group of Young Filipinos\n\nThe Filipino   243\n\nsort of reduced meat chopper) is the universal\nimplement used by the Filipino, and\nhe uses it for all purposes from paring his\ntoe nails or building a bamboo house to chopping\noff an enemy's head. And yet the\nsoil is the richest in the world, capable of\nproducing indigenous crops in rotation all\nthe year. The native contents himself with\nraising rice and chickens to eat and tobacco\nto sell, and a mighty little is needed to meet\nhis wants. He spends most of his time\nsleeping or staring into space or training\nhis rooster for the cock main. Most of the\nrough work is unloaded on the little women,\nwho are jewels of their kind. The average\nFilipino appears to have been born tired,\nwhile the women have to keep moving all\nthe time. But this is true all over the\nOrient.\n\nOur troubles began in earnest at Bayambang.\nIt was all that the presidente could\ndo to get us the little horses and attendants\nnecessary to begin our trip across the\nIsland. The scarcity of animal life in the\nPhilippine Islands is most remarkable; the\nhorses and oxen (caraboa) have gone to\nseed, which also appeared to me to be true\nof the people, especially the Tagalos - the\nbrainiest and most bellicose of the Filipino\ntribes. The horses are of the size of Shetland\nponies, but they have the strength of\ngiants, while the ox is a great big affair\nwhich, like the Filipino, wants to stop and\nrest under every shade tree and must and\nwill wade into every stream crossed and\nhave a good cool off.\n\nAt Rosales we stopped with the Lieutenant\nof the Philippine Constabulary, a Massachusetts\nman and a gentleman every inch.\nHe was mighty glad to see us. A few\nnights before, a body of insurrectors had\nraided his pueblo, and there were plenty of\nbullet holes in his bamboo home. His little\nbrown soldiers were armed with Springfields,\nsingle-charge shot guns and 48-calibre\narmy pistols, like those we carried. In\nthe excitement of the raid, they had not\nthe necessary strength to pull the trigger\nof the big pistols. They should be provided\nwith a pistol as large as that they are\ncompelled to carry now.\n\nWe arrived at Carranglan, in the Caraballe\nmountains, March 12th, in the late afternoon,\nhaving traversed the Pangasinan\ncountry as it called. There were no evidences\nof industry or prosperity anywhere\n\nalong the route. The people were without\nspirit or intelligence, and we found them\noften, sullen, unobliging and menacing in\ndisposition. I take it that there are no\nmore than 1,000,000 Filipinos in the Pangasinan\ncountry, while the country could\nsustain in opulance 4,000,000 people who\nwould develop the magnificent agricultural\nresources of the country, such as rice, sugar,\ntobacco, and the cereals adapted to the\nsoil and the climate, which is of a black,\nsticky character, volcanic in origin. It is\na pity to let so much good land go to waste.\n\nWe stopped with an old black trooper at\nCarranglan. He had a native wife, kept a\nsmall store, called a canteen (in which there\nwas no liquor) and cultivated a large rice\nplantation. Like all the Negroes we had\nso far met in our journey, he was coal black\nand seemed to be perfectly at home. He\nwas happy and making money, and never\nexpected to return to the United States -\nand what black man out of it and doing\nwell, should?\n\nTo cross the Caraballe mountains, is a\nfearful task. We were told that it was\nthirty-five miles from Carranglan to Dupax,\non the opposite side of the mountains. In\na straight line, perhaps, but in the actual\njourney with its serpentine windings it\nmust be seventy miles. We left Carranglan\nearly on the morning of March 13th, expecting\nto reach Dupax by six in the evening.\nAt nine that night we had only covered\nhalf the distance. We had forded one\nmountain stream twenty-one times, had lost\nall our provisions, and were tired and hungry\nwhen we got on top, at a place called\nSanta Clara, a large open space two acres in\nextent, with no house. Here the weary\ntravelers stop, cook their rice and coffee and \nsleep until the moon rises, when they pursue\ntheir journey down the mountains. \nThere were a dozen travelers on the top of\nthe mountain, stretched out on the ground,\nwrapped in white cotton sheets, with their\nfaces turned towards the heavens. We had\npassed these people several times in the\njourney. We asked if they had anything\nto eat. A Chino-Filipino scraped up a pot\nof coffee and a hunk of dried venison. The\nlatter had a loud and vulgar smell. Captain\nWoods refused to touch it, but I, I\nwas hungry as never before, so I made the\nrank meat disappear and washed it down\nwith the coffee. It was good.

To relieve this misery, the Procurement and\nAssignment Services of the War Manpower Commission last year instituted a\nvoluntary method to persuade doctors to move to the shortage areas. Doctor\nrecruiting was also limited to 20 states and the District of Columbia, which\nwere considered well staffed.\n\nBetween January, 1942 and February, 1944, 2,955 doctors were relocated.\nThe Service had the cooperation of the United States Public Health Service,\nwhich offered the moving doctor $250 a month for three months, plus transportation\nexpenses, provided the community paid one-fourth of the total cost. In\nthis way, 135 of the 510 shortage areas were eased. Another 146 areas found\nrelief by persuading older doctors out of retirement, shifting specialists to\ngeneral practice and freezing doctors in essential areas.\n\nBut for 166 shortage areas there was no solution.  The stumbling blocks:\n(1) varying state license requirements; (2) refusal of older, established men\nto move; (3) the tendency of doctors to move from rural to urban areas. As\nthe late Dr. Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins University put it: \"Physicians behave\nlike any other group of sensible business persons. They do business where\nit is good and avoid places where it is bad.\"\n\nDISTAFF DOCTORS IN THE WAR\n\nWomen doctors, too, have shown a business sense in wartime. Although they\nfought stubbornly for military service, only a few of the country's 7.000 women\nphysicians volunteered when the Army and Navy dropped their bars.  At present\n38 are in the Naval Reserve, 75, mostly middle-aged, in the Army Medical Corps.\n\nReasons assigned for not enlisting:  jobs from which they would not be released;\nduty to families; fear of being put on recruit examining, or of being\ngiven some job not their specialty.\n\nThe more obvious cause for the small enlistment is that for the first\ntime women doctors, by necessity, are getting a break in civilian practice.\nAt the same time, women's registration in medical schools has boomed- at the\nWoman's Medical College in Philadelphia, Johns Hopkins, the University of\nPennsylvania, Hahnemann Hospital, Northwestern University, University of Maryland,\nand the University of California, and so on. This year for the first time,\nin its 162 years, Harvard Medical School opened its courses to female students.\n\n[*Because although there were 2 organizations of colored\nwomen the member broadminded enough to agree\nthat it would be impossible successfully to maintain two\nnational organizations in that stage of their development\nan much more would be accomplished by putting all their\nenergy and resources into one body than by dividing them\ninto two.

The methods of punishing Negro\ncriminals is calculated to breed crime\nrather than to stop it.  Lynching spreads \namong black folk the firmly fixed idea that\nfew accused Negroes are really guilty; the\nleasing of convicts even under the present\nsystem of state control, makes the state \ntraffic in crime for the sake of revenue instead\nof seeking to reform criminals for the\nsake of mortal regeneration; and finally the\npunishment of Negro criminals is usually\nunintelligent; they are punished according \nto the crime rather than according to their\ncriminal record; little discrimination is\nmade between old and young, male and\nfemale, hardened thug and careless mischief-maker; \nand the result is that a single\nsentence to the chaingang for a trivial misdemeanor\nusually makes the victim a confirmed\ncriminal for life.\n3.  There is no evidence to show that\ncrime is increasing among Negroes in this\nstate.  Save in a few of the larger towns \n\nthere seems to be a marked decrease since\n1896.\n4.  The cure for Negro crime lies in moral\nuplift and inspiration among Negroes. The\nmasses of the race must be made vividly to\nrealize that no man ever has an excuse for\nlaziness, carelessness, and wrongdoing. That\nthese are not a cure for oppression, but\nrather invite and encourage further oppression.\nNegroes then must be taught to stop \nfighting, gambling and stealing, which seem\nto be the usual misdemeanors of the careless;\nand particularly the law-abiding must\nseparate themselves from that dangerous\ncriminal element among us who are responsible\nfor murder, rape and burglary, and\nvigorously condemn the crime and criminal.\nFour agencies among Negroes may work \ntoward this end; the church, the school,\ninstitutions for rescue work and the juvenile\nreformatory.  The first step in Georgia\nwould seem to be one toward a reformatory\nfor Negro youth.\n5.  Finally, this conference appeals to\nwhite people of Georgia for six things:\nfairer criminal laws, justice in the courts; \nthe abolition of state traffic in crime for\npublic revenue and private gain; more intelligent\nmethods of punishment; the refusal \nto allow free labor to be displaced by\nconvict labor; and finally a wider recognition\nof the fact that honest, law-abiding \nblack men are safer neighbors than ignorant\nunder-paid serfs, because it is the latter\nclass that breeds dangerous crimes. \n\nA SONG OF SUMMER\nBy Silas X.

Hey, ho!\nAnd winter has departed\nWith all its frost and snow.\nOne day that's dressed in sunshine,\nWhen flowers are in bloom,\nIs better than a thousand\nWhen all is dressed with gloom.\n\nDown to the streams I'll hie me,\nI'll hunt the wild, wild rose,\nOr in the fields I'll frolic\nWhere grateful herds repose.\nO, list! the birds are singing\n\"Good night\" while daylight flies--\nO, see! the stars are swinging\nLike diamonds in the skies.\n\nSoon on my couch I'll slumber,\nLike a little child tired of play,\nAnd in the midnight watches\nI'll dream of the better day; \nDream of the day eternal\nWhen winter's race is run,\nWhere lives forever summer,\nAnd endless shines the sun. \n\n\nWILLIAM A.

Immature thought\nor blind prejudice frequently lash the waters\nof race opposition by seeking to keep the\nraces apart.  The statement is reiterated\nin press and pulpit that the Negro must\nnot and cannot be made into a white man.\nThree minutes of sober thinking will convince\nanyone that the formerly African\nNegro has been converted into a Anglo-Saxon.\nAnglo-Saxonism now is broader\nthan blood; it refers to thought, sentiment\nand spirit, and these may be written out\ninto an isosceles triangle; language and \n\nreligion.  In these two items the American\nNegro is as thoroughly Anglo-Saxon as\nthe lion's whelp that shapes the destiny of\nthe nation.  The American Negro has had\nthe Anglo-Saxon for a teacher for generations,\nrepresenting two types of thought\nand method.  Attention is drawn at this\ntime to the southern type of the teacher\nwho has impressed his intense personality\nupon his tractable nature.  The pupil has\nnot failed to copy as well as learn from his\nversatile teacher.\nWhat has the Negro learned from the\nsouthern white man?\nThe first lesson that this pupil has learned\nis love of race.  The constant emphasis\nplaced on this race idea, emphasizing the\nexclusiveness of the Anglo-Saxon in superior\nvirtues, has led him to feel that the racial\nidea takes precedence with his teacher over\nthe humanity idea.  To many of the pupils\neven the sermons delivered from the sacred\ndesk are a more glorification of Anglo-Saxon\ncivilization than of Christianity.\nThis may be an extreme, erroneous pressing\nof the case, nevertheless, the facts lie\nopen before the faithful.  The permanent\nless on that the pupil retains is, the intense\nand passionate love of race is a virtue to be\ncultivated.\nA second lesson learned is the high estimate\nplaced upon womanhood.  Of all\npeoples on the face of the earth, none are\nmore chivalrous toward women, none more\nrespectful of womanly virtue and none so\nready to protect the sanctity of the home\nwith their very blood as the southern white\nman.  In the glorious period of the Roman\nempire to be a citizen of Rome was greater\nthan being a king.  In all the south a \nwhite man considers a white woman a\nqueen.  If the south had failed in all\nother lessons, this one truth, grounded into\nthe blood of the Negro, and which he is\ntaking hold of more and more, is of greater\nvalue than can be computed in figures. \nWould to God that these descendants of\nthe chivalric Huguenots and of the daring \n\n\n", "158", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00668", "256     THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO\n\nSaxons would learn that virtue irrespective\nof the color of the skin that contains it, should\nbe protected in all, and that the innocent\ncabin of the laboring poor deserves the same\nconsideration as the pure minded dwellers of\nthe palace.  This simple teacher has learned\nfrom his wise teacher that he too must\nstand guard with uncovered head and\nbronzed arms over his wife, daughter, sister\nand the sacred precincts of his home.\nA third lesson this teacher is pressing\nhome upon his wistful pupil is that social\nequality is not a gift of statutory enactments.\nThe simple-minded ex-slave naturally\nconcluded that liberty and civic\nequality carried with them as a corrolary\nsocial equality.  Through these years of\nhard discipline, he has learned that social\npreferences root themselves in individual\nwhims and prejudices and are more securely\nprotected by the law than the civic liberties\nof a republic.  The conferring, therefore,\nof a social privilege is a matter of social\nprerogative.  Many uninformed or misinformed\nfriends charge that the Negro\nthreatens the social integrity of the whites\nby obnoxiously seeking social equality.\nIf they did but know that there is no such\nthing as social equality, they would save\nthemselves unnecessarily feverishness about\na mythical bogie.  We choose our own\nsocial equals, and it is as honorable to us\nto be the guests of a cultured Negro family\nas to be that of a cultured white family.\nWe have learned the lesson.  Other lessons\nwill be referred to at another time.\n\nSUMMER CONVENTIONS AND\nCONFERENCES\nThe summer season of this year will be\nmade famous by reason of the great religious \ngatherings of the year.  There will\nbe three great general conferences of the\nvarious Methodist bodies.  Chief among\nthese is the general conference of the\nMethodist Episcopal church which will convene \n\nat Los Angeles, Cal., May 4th, and\ncontinued a month.  This conference will be\ncomposed of 748 delegates.  Of these twenty-five\nare women.  Eighty-two represent\ncolored conferences, but three of which are \nwhite men; forty-tow are from the foreign\nfields.  It will require 499 to elect a bishop.\nOne hundred and eighty of these delegates\nwere in the last general conference.\nThe general conference of the A. M. E. \nchurch convened at Chicago, Ills., May\n2d.  This is the second largest body \nof Negro Methodist in the word.  They\nhave contributed largely to spread Christianity\namong the race and hold a conspicuous\nplace in supplying the race with\nstrong men.\nThe National Baptist convention meets\nin September in Austin, Tex.  This religious\nbody is the largest among the race.\nThis convention meets yearly and draws \nfrom all parts of the nation.  The rapid\ngrowth of the Baptist denomination is a \nconstant source of wonderment.  This denomination\nhas the exclusive distinction of\nhaving built up the largest, best equipped\nand most efficient publishing house the race\nhas thus far built.  All of the conventions\nand conferences attract large audiences of\nsympathizers, and their deliberations are\npublished in the daily press.\n\nPROSPECTS ENCOURAGING\nOne of the editors of The Voice has just\nreturned from a twelve days' trip through\nNorth Carolina and Virginia.  He comes\nback to the office greatly encouraged. \nEverywhere he went he found that the\npeople were anxious and ready for our \n\n\nIN THE SANCTUM     257 \n\nMagazine.  On the train between Charlotte\nand Danville, we handed to a man who sat\nnear us a circular with printed testimonials\nof the value and timeliness of The Voice.  The\nman soon asked for a copy of the Magazine\nfor which he paid.  Then he settled down\nin his seat to reading.  When we had gone\nabout seventy-five miles this man took out his\ndollar, wrote his name and address on a slip\nof paper and handed both to the editor.\nThus it is.  The Voice of the Negro needs \nno trumping up.  It speaks for itself.\nEverybody seems to be satisfied with the\nnote of courage that rings through all of\nour pages.  One of the teachers at the state\nschool at Petersburg told us that it was\nabout the only thing the Negro had that\nspoke with courage, and was unabated in\nits protest against the evils of the day.\nCertainly we are not prepared to say that\nall of the other Negro papers have shriveled\nup into sheets of sychophancy, but one \nthing we are sure of, and that is that we\nare here to plead boldly and fearlessly\nfor our people.  We want no compromise\nthat does not recognize us as men, and does\nnot give us all the rights that belong to\nmen.  One of our subscribers who has recently\nchanged here address, says:  \"Please\nsend your blessed militant, up-to-date and\nup-to-facts Magazine to my new address at\nonce.\"  What this subscriber thinks of us\nis but the reflection of the thoughts of\nthousands of others, as is evidenced\nin the letters we receive, and in compliments\nwe heard while away.  So, we have come\nback to our desk with renewed zeal, and\nhave reconsecrated our life to the making\nof a great Voice that shall be heard from\nshore to shore in the interest of our people. \n\nOur page for \"New Contributors\" has\nbeen omitted in this and the May number\nbecause of the difficulty we experienced\nin getting accurate sketches, and it would\nlook a little odd to introduce a few newcomers\nand appear to slight others.  We\nhave not decided yet as to what we will\nfinally do about the matter.\n\nAFTER GRADUATION WHAT\nWith the close of the month of June,\nupwards of one thousand young men and\nwomen of the Negro race will receive certificates\nor diplomas of graduation from \n\nhigh schools, academies, seminaries, colleges \nand universities and professional\nschools.  This fact is highly creditable to\na race so recently liberated, and who were \ncharged with lack of capacity for book\nlearning.  The falsely-called sugar-headed\nNegro has settled forever that this oft-repeated\ncharge is empty of truth.  The\ncontempt thrown upon the early educators\nof this race for starting schools of higher\nlearning has lost its force in the face of\nthe cultured, sensible and law-abiding \nhosts of men and women produced by the\nschools.  These educators did not neglect\nthe weightier matters of the land in their\nearly efforts, but grounded well their pupils\nin the fundamentals of right living.\nThe statement may be made that the guiding\nhands of the race in the turgid and\nturbulent waters of the day are the hands \nthat led twenty years or more ago by the\nso-called \"Enthusiasts and Visionaries.\" \nThe Negro race may well thank God\nthat the question has been fully settled.\nThe proof is now read by all.  But there \nare other matters that must receive their\nattention.  A knowledge of mathematics is\nnot the all, neither does a diploma guarantee\nthat its holder is entitled to the place\nof honor.  work, efficiency and character\ntake precedence over all other endowments.\nMen holding diplomas must be told that a \ndiploma is a parchment of recommendation;\nthat character is a product of years of self\ndenial and struggle and that the diploma\nis to be proved by a practical life of activity.\nThese graduated must learn in the school\nof practical life that the race needs no wall \nflowers, polished idlers or cultured dudes.\nWe need men and women who can and will\nroll up their sleeves and do something toward\nimproving the condition of the race.\nAny system of education or culture that\ndoes not keep in mind the needs of this race\nis a farce and a curse.  Teach these boys to\nfind the roots of Latin and Greek verbs,\nand teach them also to find the root of a\nfaithful ax; teach these girls that a clean \nroom and a clean garment are more essential\nin character-building than a clean examination\npaper.  In sum, let these graduates\nknow that graduation is only the commencement \nof life and that life means work,\nhard and persistent work of all kinds.  Let\nthem know that:\n\"Life is real, life is earnest.\" \n\n", "159", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00679", "FINE JOB PRINTING\nMAIL ORDERS A SPECIALTY\nNeat Work!\nQuick Work!\nSearchlight Printing Company\n208 West Ninth Street Chattanooga, Tenn.\n\nResidence, 273 Auburn Avenue\nOffice Hours: 8:30 A.

Autumn\nis a maiden, the locks of whose hair\nare luscious bunches of rich ripe grapes.\nShe is the season of the harvest and the\nsickle.\n\nThe University the\nBirthplace of Reform\n\nDuring the last of\nSeptember and the\nbeginning of October,\nthe doors of the school-rooms, colleges\nand universities of the land swing wide to\nhardly less than 17,500,000 boys and girls\nand men and women anxious to enlarge the\nrange of their information. Since this is\nthe season for the opening of schools it may\nnot be amiss to call attention to the part\nthe school - particularly the University, has\nplayed in the development of our modern\ncivilization. We hold that a careful perusal\nof history will reveal the fact that the\nuniversity is the birthplace of all the great\nreforms that have taken place in modern\ntimes. The great Reformation of the early\npart of the Sixteenth Century which thoroughly\nrevolutionized Germany and England\nhad its birthplace in the Italian Renaissance.\nThe Renaissance was born at\nConstantinople where exiled Greek and\nItalian scholars had sought refuge from the\nfierce persecutions of the age. The history\nof this movement is but the history of self-\nattainment, of self-conscious freedom by\nthe European races. It was the period\nwhen men began to think for themselves.\nThey questioned rules and dogmas, and\ntheir critical and inquisitive genius gave\nbirth to some mighty and significant movements.\nIt marked the enfranchisement of\nthe human mind from religious and political\ndespotism. The discovery of America\nis directly traceable to the intellectual\nawakening of that age. Luther started the\nGerman reformation at the University of\nWittenburg, and his nailing of his ninety-\nsix theses over the old University door set\nthe tongues of all ecclesiastical Europe\nagog. Luther's co-partner, Melanthon,\n\nwas a great scholar and University devotee.\nJohn Wycliff, the morning star of the Reformation\nin England, received his impulse\nto know for himself at Oxford. Zwingli,\nthe most striking figure in the Swiss Reformation,\nwas a student at Basel and Bern and\nthe University of Vienna. His old teacher,\nThomas Wattenbach, imbued him with the\nspirit of the new learning. John Major\ntaught John Knox, of Scotland, that councils\nwere above popes and that nations give\nauthority to kings, and Knox never forgot\nthat truth from the day he left the University\nof Saint Andrews to his death. There\nis no question about it, the Lollards of England,\nwere born at Oxford; and by their\npersistent assaults upon the dogmatisms of\nthe age, by the students debating the expediency\nof diverting the tithes to support the\npoor, by the open questioning of the capability\nor incapability of churchmen to administer\nsecular offices, speculation was\nquickened, the Briton grasped the skirts of\ncivilization, the treasure houses of the classics\nwere unlocked, poverty melted, the\nmasses of teuonic people were severed forever\nfrom the body of the Catholic church,\nand such a haze of profusion spread over all\nEngland that men lost their pessimism and\ncalled the ear \"The Golden Age.\" Thus\nwe see how the past reformations were born\nin the seats of learning. Even so now the\nUniversity will not be true to its duties if it\nfails to exercise a mighty influence upon\nthe times. It is a beautiful spectacle, the\nsight of vast throngs of young folks with\nthe dewy light of hope illuminating their\ncountenances as they hurry to the schoolroom.\nIt is a propitous omen. When the\nyoung American takes to the slate and the\nblackboard, let demagogs beware. Do the\nstudents realize their tremendous opportunities?\nThere was never more need for educated\nmen and women to help solve the\nvexing problems of the century. The age\nand the race are calling for the genuine\npath-finder. The century awoke amid the\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW   433\n\nconvulsions of war and we were ushered into\na wilderness of intricate problems. Who\nwill turn our faces towards the Gates of the\nSun? Here in the South we are shrouded\nin the dark mist-veil of prejudice and ignorance.\nWho will lead us out of the darkness\nof this fatricidal hatred? How shall\nwe check the dread ravages of disease?\nHow shall we better the condition of the\ndelinquents and defectives of society?\nWhat shall we do with the strikes and the\ntrusts? How shall we secure to the world\npermanent and lasting peace? In the\nanswer to all these questions the University\nmust exercise a potential influence upon the\npublic mind. The University is the powerful\nsearchlight that searches the seas for the approach\nof the ships of the enemies of humanity.\nThey are the watchmen upon the\nwall peering through the dark into the\ndawn and watching for the signs of fresh\nlight. There is a radical set of whites in\nthe South who do not want the Negro to be\neducated. We desire the exact opposite\nfor these poor whites. Their prejudice is\nborn of their ignorance and we want them\nto be liberally educated. A man with his\neyes open cannot long make a fool of himself.\nHe will learn the truth that there is\nno virtue in color. The University students\nhave a high calling - the call to prepare\nthemselves for the tremendous responsibilities\nof the age - the call to solve the\nproblems of a complex civilization and to\nscatter the seeds of altruism broadcast. In\nshort, they have a mighty call to make\nthemselves felt in accelerating the social\nbetterment of mankind.\n\nThe Battle of\nLiaoyang\n\nThe month of baffling\nmovements of the Japanese\narmies in Manchuria had\nLiaoyang as their objective point. Kuropatkin\nhad, after his first retreat the first\nof August from the mountain passes of\nTashikao, Shimuchen, Yangze and Yushulinkzu\ndrawn in his might army to Anshanshan,\n\nAnshanshan, Liandianisian an Anping. These\nwere strong outposts in the mountains of\nLiaoyang which the Russian general had\ndetermined to hold. But it seems after a\ndetermination to hold these places Kuropatkin\nchanged his mind, for all three of\nthese places were taken with comparative\nease by the Japanese. Kuropatkin drew\nhis entire army in to form a kind of semi-\ncircle before Liaoyang on the southern and\neastern plains. The abandonment of these\nstrong positions by the Russians permitted\nthe three powerful Japanese armies to unite\nin a kind of enveloping half-circle. Nodzu\noccupied the center of the Japanese forces,\nOku held the left wing, while Kuroki was at\nAnping on the right. It will be observed\nthat Anping is on the south side of the\nTaitse river which runs directly east and\nwest through Liaoyang. This made it so\nthat Kuroki commanded with his powerful\nguns the valley of the Taitse and could prevent\nany flanking of the Japanese right by\nthe Russians. The entire forces in the vicinity\nof Liaoyang were about 400,000, the\nRussians having probably 25,000 men less\nthan the Japanese. But Kuropatkin believed\nthat the Russians had the advantage\nin spite of this and deliberately chose the\nplains south of Liaoyang for a battle ground.\nAnd Kuropatkin's reason for this belief is\nnot hard to find. For many months he had\nemployed the most eminent living Russian\nengineer fortifying Liaoyang. Pits were\ndug around the city and sharp sticks were\ndriven down in them. Then the pits were\ncarefully covered over with grass and leaves\nas the South African covers his pits to\ncatch the elephant. Barbed wire entanglements\nwere placed everywhere. Kuropatkin\nknew that he had the longest range\nguns. The Taitse rolled at his back and\nat Liaoyang it was to serve as a barrier to\nprevent the Japanese making a flank movement.\nAnd besides all of this, the plains\nwere level before Liaoyang so that the notorious\nCossacks could ride down the despised", "172", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00683", "436   THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO\n\nto the opposing party to come before the\nAmerican people with some definite opposing\nissues. The bold and searching questions\nthe president asks, are questions\nwhich Judge Parker must answer categorically\nin his letter of acceptance or accept\nthe odium that belongs to the hypocrite. In\nspeaking of Democratic criticism of the\nPanama coup d'tat, Mr. Roosevelt says\nthat they \"can criticise what we did in\nPanama only on condition of misrepresenting\nwhat was done.\" He makes the same\nstatement in speaking of the Democratic attitude\ntowards our foreign policy. He\nshows clearly that he was within the bounds\nof his authority when the pension order of\nwhich the Democrats complained so much,\nwas issued and further states that public\nmorality called for care for the men who\nsought to save the country in its critical\nhour and who are now too old to earn a\nlivelihood. The Democratic platform calls\nthe tariff a \"robbery.\" Mr. Roosevelt's\nanswer is that if it is a robbery, they must\ntake off all protection should they come into\npower; for merely to lower the tariff\nwould be to show a preference for some\n\"robbery,\" at least. He asks if they mean\nto repeal the tariff laws. The Democrats\nare now calling for a strict observance of\nthe letter and spirit of the Constitution in\nthe Philippines. The president asks if they\nare quite so zealous for the enforcement of\nthe Constitution in our own country, refering\nof course, to the South's reckless disregard\nfor the war amendments to the Constitution.\nThe ridiculously of the \"Parker constitution\nclubs\" must be calculated to turn\nthe stomach of an honest alligator. It is\nthe veriest sarcasm. It is the most inconsistent\nthing the Democrats could do. It is\nthe Democrats who are constantly making\nassaults upon the Constitution, who tried\nforty years ago not only to break up the\nConstitution, but the Union itself, who by\nsubsterfuges and makeshifts have nullified\nthe Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments\n\nin almost every southern state and whose\nopen boast is their ability to get possession\nof the southern governments whether by\nhook or crook. Their own candidate is\nopposed to the Fifteenth Amendment and\ntheir vice-presidential candidate has openly\nadvocated wholesale Negro disfranchisement\nfor purely political purposes. The\nDemocrats love the constitution? Not much.\nAnd all of the swash-buckling of Henry\nWatterson and Bourke Cochran cannot convince\nthe American people that they do.\nThe president is right in saying that it is\nhard to respect men with such evaporating\nprinciples as the Democrats have. Every\nsincere student of the history of the Democratic\nparty must agree with Mr. Roosevelt\nwhen he gives utterance to the following\nparagraph:\n\n\"It is difficult to find out from the utterances of\nour opponents what are the real issues upon which\nthey propose to wage this campaign. It is not unfair\nto say that, having abandoned most of the\nprinciples upon which they have insisted during\nthe last eight years, they now seem at a loss both\nas to what it is they really believe and as to how\nfirmly they shall assert their belief in anything.\"\n\nBut of course they believe in one thing\nsteadfastly, and that is that the Negro must\nnot be treated as a man and brother. The\nfollowing is also a characteristic paragraph\nof the letter:\n\n\"We make our appeal to no class and to no section,\nbut to all good citizens in whatever part of\nthe land they dwell. We stand for enforcement of\nthe law and for obedience to the law. We hold\never before us as the all-important end of policy\nand administration the reign of peace at home and\nthroughout the world; of peace, which comes only\nby doing justice.\"\n\nThe president's charge that the Democrats\ncan change convictions with \"facile\nease\" is an accurate description of that party's\nrecord. As a Democratic paper of\nSacramento, which has come out for Roosevelt,\nsays:\n\n\"The Democratic platform darts out speaking\nlike a Chatham street second-handed clothing dealer,\nappealing to each voter: 'My opinions are\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW   437\n\njust the same as yours. Vot are yours? Come in\nand I will show you a coat that will perfectly fit\nyou. I can fit any man of any size.\"\n\nIt seems as if Democracy's most vulnerable\npoint is the fact that she cannot hold\nand opinion over night.\n\nMr. Watson's Adroit\nCampaign\n\nAs stated sometime\nin the past in this\nmagazine, the Honorable\nThos. E. Watson of Thomson, Ga.,\nis running on the Populist ticket for the\npresidency of the United States. Mr.\nWatson is a brilliant scholar, a great\norator and a prolific writer. He commands\nthe highest respect among the cracker element\nof the Georgia white people. In\nmaking the run for the presidency, Mr.\nWatson has laid his plans well and it is\nsafe to say that he is waging the shrewdest\ncampaign of all the candidates now in the\nrace. That Mr. Watson will poll an\nunusually heavy vote for a Populist no\ncareful observer can afford to doubt. His\nplan of campaign as revealed in two of his\nspeeches - one in New York and one in\nAtlanta - is very obvious. Mr. Watson\nseeks to draw from the radical Democracy\nfor his support. He recognizes the fact\nthat he differs too radically even with the\naggressive element of the Republican party\nto hope to corral any of the voters of that\nparty, and since the Democrats saw fit to\nsupport him on the ticket with Bryan in\n1900, it stands to reason to believe that he\ncan get some Democratic support this year\nfrom the Bryan wing of the party. North\nand South there is great unrest and dissatisfaction\namong this brand of Democrats\nand there is no question about it, they are\ncasting about for a leader. If they could\nbe properly mustered, around their standard\nwould flock that vast herd of \"Huns,\"\nthe \"Reds,\" and every one who belonged\nto the nether part of society. The poor\nclass who think that the rich ought to\n\"whack up\" with them would welcome a\nreal opportunity to get in power. Mr.\n\nWatson, as a student of society, has detected\nthis condition of affairs, and thus like\nDavid, he has summoned this band of malcontents\nto his side and gone forth to battle.\nIn New York Mr. Watson attacked\nJudge Parker vigorously and hit the Democrats\nin their most vulnerable points, inconsistency\nand hypocrisy. In Atlanta he\nfollowed the same line of attack, and in addition\nto this, he played skillfully upon the\nsectional prejudices of the South. He\nsaid that nobody knew how Mr. Parker\nstood on the Negro question, called the\nJudge a \"Cleveland Yankee,\" lavished\nevery adjective of praise he could find upon\nthis section of the country, taking care to\nmention Tillman and Hardwick as heroes,\nand finally said that the Populists were\nwilling to help to disfranchise the Negro.\nIn discussing the Negro question, Mr.\nWatson showed, a sad lack of decent training\nin good English by constantly and contemptuously\nreferring to the colored man\nas \"the nigger.\" He severely criticised \nJudge Parker for addressing a colored man\nas \"My Dear Sir,\" and yet the writer has\non file in this office two letters from Mr.\nWatson in which he saluted him as \"Dear\nSir.\" Of course there is no consistency in\nMr. Watson's position on the race question,\nfor a few years ago as a Populist he openly\nsought the Negro vote.

But as\nof a few days ago, I am a Democrat-- an Averell\nHarriman Democrat, and I am convinced he is the \nsole candidate that I can support and still be\nfaithful to my race. The first thing that\nconvinced me of this was the fact that Mr.\nHarriman has shown by his deeds as well as by his\nwords that he believes in civil rights, and that\nif elected President of the United States, he \nwill take positive action to enable us, the colored \npeople of our national capital, and of this\ncountry-- called the greatest democracy on earth--\nto make the progress to which we are entitled \nunder the Constitution.\n\nREVELLA CLAY: Mrs. Terrell, I realize that you have had an\nextremely long affiliation with the Republican\nParty.

He is illustrative and exemplary\nof what they might become, the first\nfruit of promise of a dormant race.  To the\naspiring colored youth of this land, Mr.\nDouglass is, at once, the inspiration of their\nhopes and the justification of their claims. \nI do not on this occasion intend to dwell\nupon the well known facts and circumstances\nin the life and career of Mr. Douglass,\nbut deem it more profitable to point\nout some of the lessons to be derived from\nthat life.\nI.  In the first place, Mr. Douglass began\nlife at the lowest possible level.  It is only\nwhen we understand the personal circumstances\nof his early environment that we \ncan appreciate the pathos and power with\nwhich he was wont to insist upon the true \nmeasure of the progress of the American\nNegro, not by the height already attained,\nbut by the depth from which he came.  It\nhas been truly said that it required a greater \nupward move to bring Mr. Douglass to\nthe status in which the ordinary white child\nis born than is necessary on the part of the\nlatter to reach the presidency of the United\nStates.  The early life of this gifted child\nof nature was spent amid squalor, deprivation\nand cruel usage.  Like Melchisedek,\nit can be said of him that he sprung into\nexistence without father or mother or beginning\nof days.  His little body was unprotected\nfrom the bitter, biting cold, and\nhis vitals griped with the gnawing pangs of\nhunger.  We are told that he vied with the\ndogs for the crumbs that fell from his master's\ntable.  He tasted the sting of a cruel \nslavery, and drank the cup to its very dregs.\nAnd yet he arose from this lowly and degraded\nestate and gained for himself a \n\nplace among the illustrious names of his\ncountry.\nWe hear much in this day and time about\nthe relative force of environment and heredity\nas factors in the formation of character.\nBut, as the career of Mr. Douglas illustrates,\nthere is a subtle power of personality\nwhich, though the product of neither,\nis more potent than both.  God has given\nto each of us an irrepressible inner something,\nwhich for want of better designation,\nthe old philosophy used to call the freedom\nof will, which counts for most in the making\nof manhood.  Someone attempted to\nridicule the poverty of Sam Johnson by saying\nthat he lived in an alley, but the flippant\ncalumniator of genius was completely\nsilenced by the reply:  \"Sir, your soul lives\nin an alley.\"  What boots it though the\nbody rest in a king's palace, if the soul \ndwells in a dark, dingy and squalid abode?\nBetter be like Diogenes in a tub, with the\ncourage and spirit to make the monarch\nstand out of your sunshine.  The true man\nor woman will let nothing, not even the\nking, stand between him and the sunlight\nof aspiration and hope.\nLet the rising Negro learn from Mr.\nDouglass that neither poverty, nor social\ndegradation, nor iniquitous institution can\nfetter a resolute soul which dares assert its\npower.\n\n\"From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,\nThe place is dignified by the doer's deed.\" \n\n2.  In the second place, I would call attention\nto the tremendous significance of a \nseemingly trifling incident in your Douglass'\nlife.  When he was about thirteen\nyears of age he came into the possession of\na copy of the Columbian Orator, abounding\nin dramatic outbursts and stirring episodes\nof liberty.  It was the ripened fruit of the\nchoicest spirits, upon which the choicest\nspirits feed.  This book fired his whole\nsoul and kindled an unquenchable love for\nliberty.  It is held by some that at the age \n\n\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS     463 \n\nof puberty the mind is in a state of unstable\nequilibrium, and like a pyramid on its\napex, may be thrown in any direction by\nthe slightest impression of force.  The instantaneity\nof religious conversions, which\nthe Methodists used to acclaim with such\ntriumphant outbursts of hallelujahs, may \nrest upon some such psychological foundation.\nWhen the child nature stands at the\nparting of the ways, between youth and\nadolescence, it yields to some quickening\ntouch, as the fuse to the spark, or as the\nsensitized plat to the impressions of sunlight.\nThere are psychological moments \nwhen the revealed idea rises sublimely above\nthe revealing agent.  According to the\ntheory of harmonics, if two instruments are\ntuned in resonant accord, the vibrations of\nthe one will wake up the slumbering chords\nof the other.  Young Douglass' soul was in\nsympathetic resonance with the great truth\nof human brotherhood and equality, and\nneeded only the psychological suggestion,\nwhich the Columbian Orator supplied.  In\na moment, in the twinkling of an eye, it\nburned deep into his soul and made an ineffacable\nimpression of the brotherhood and\nequality of man.  It was the same truth\nwhich could only be impressed upon the\nApostle Peter in the rhapsodies of a heavenly\nvision.  The age of revelation is not past, and\nwill not pass so long as there remains one\nsoul that years for spiritual illumination.\nThere comes at times in our lives some sudden\necho of the heavenly harmony from the\nunseen world, and happy is that soul which\nbeats in vibrant harmony with that supernal\nsound.  When the gospel of liberty first\ndawned upon the adolescent Douglass as he\nperused the pages of the Columbian Orator,\nthere is no rendition of either the old or the\nnew psychology that can analyze the riot of\nthought and sentiment that swept through \nhis turbulent soul.  This was indeed his\nnew birth, his baptism with wine from on\nhigh.  From that moment he was a possessed\nman.  The love of liberty bound him \n\nwith its subtle cords and did not release\nhim until the hour of his death on Anacostia's\nmist-clad height. \nOur educational philosophers are ransacking\ntheir brains to prescribe wise curricula\nof study for colored youth.  There is not\nso much need of that which gives information\nto the mind or cunning to the fingers \nas that which touches the soul and quickens \nthe spirit.  There must be first aroused\ndormant consciousness of manhood with its\ninalienable rights, privileges and dignity.\nThe letter killeth, the spirit maketh \nalive.  The Columbian Orator contributed\nmore toward arousing the manhood of Mr.\nDouglass than all the traditional knowledge \nof all the schools.  Of what avail is the\nhidden springs of manhood?  The value of\nany curriculum of study for a suppressed \nclass that is not pregnant with moral energy, \nand that does make insistent and incessant\nappeal to the half conscious manhood \nwithin, is seriously questionable.  The\nrevelation to a young man of the dignity,\n(I had almost said the divinity) of his own\nselfhood, is worth more to him in the development\nof character and power than all\nthe knowledge of the centuries or all the\ndeluxe volumes in all of Carnegie's costly\nlibraries.\n3.  In the third place, Negro youth\nshould study Mr. Douglass as a model of\nmanly courage.  In order to get a clear\nconception of principles, let us discriminate\nsharply in the use of terms. \nCourage is that quality which enables one\nto encounter danger and difficulties with\nfirmness and resolution of spirit.  It is the\nswell of soul which meets outward pressure\nwith inner resistance.  Fortitude, on the\nother hand, is the capacity to endure, the\nability to suffer and he strong.  It is courage\nin the passive voice.  True courage\nsets up an ideal and posits a purpose;  it\ncalculates the cost and is economic of means, \n\n\n", "187", 95, 95, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00387", "Washington, D.

Even\nour Savior selected the evils against which\nbeats his wings into insensibility against\nthe iron bars of his prison house, is accounted\na foolish bird.  On the other hand,\nthe \"Linnet void of noble rage\" has gained\nthe everlasting seal of poetic disapproval.\nIt is not genuine courage to go through the\nworld like the knight in the tale with sword\nin hand and challenge on lip to offer mortal\ncombat to every windmill of opposition.\nMr. Douglass was courageous in the\nbroadest and best significance of that term.\nHe set before him as the goal of his ambition\nhis own personal freedom and that of\nhis race, and he permitted neither principalities\nnor powers, nor height nor depth,\nnor things present, not things to come, to\nswerve him from the pursuit of that purpose.\nWhen we speak of moral courage, we indulge\nin tautology of terms; for all courage\nis essentially moral.  It does not require\ncourage to go with your friends or against\nyour enemies;  it is a physical impulse to\ndo so;  but true moral courage is shown\nwhen we say no to our friends.  Mr. Douglass \nreached the climax of moral courage\nwhen he parted with William Lloyd Garrison,\nhis friend and benefactor, because of\nhonest difference of judgment, and when,\nfor the same motive, he refused to follow\nJohn Brown to the scaffold at Harper's\nFerry.  It required the iron resolution and \nsublime courage for Douglass to deny the\ntender, pathetic, fraternal appeal of the man \nwho was about to offer up himself as a \nsacrifice for an alien race.  John Brown on\nthe scaffold, dying for an alien and defenseless\nrace, is the most sublime spectacle that \n\nthis planet has seen since Christ hung on\nthe cross.  That scaffold shall be more hallowed\nduring the ages to come than any\nthrone upon which king ever sat. \nIn the fourth place, Mr. Douglass stands\nout as a model of self-respect.  Although\nhe was subject to all of the degradation and\nhumiliation of his race, yet he preserved\nthe integrity of his own soul.  It is natural\nfor a class that is despised, rejected and despitefully\nused to accept the estimate of\ntheir contemners, and to conclude that they \nare good for nothing but to be case out and\nbe trodden under foot.  In a civilization\nwhose every feature serves to impress a\nwhole people with a sense of their inferiority,\nsmall wonder if the more timid and resigned\nspirits are crushed beneath the cruel\nweight.  It requires the philosophic soul to\nstand applomb and irrational things.\nIt is the imperative that the youth of the\ncolored race have impressed upon them the\nlessons that it is not the treatment that a \nman receives that degrades him, but that \nwhich he accepts.  It does not degrade the\nsoul when the body is swallowed up by the\nearthquake or overwhelmed by the flood.\nWe are not humiliated by the rebuffs of\nnature.  No more should we feel humiliated\nand degraded by violence and outrage \nperpetrated by a powerful and arrogant\nsocial scheme.  As a man thinketh in his\nheart, so is he.  The inner freedom of soul\nis not subject to assault and battery.  Mr. \nDouglas understood this principle well.\nHe was never in truth and in deed a slave;\nfor his soul never accepted the gyves that\nshackled his body.\nIt is related that Mr. Douglass was once\nordered out of a first-class coach into a\n\"jim crow\" car by a rude and ill-mannered\nconductor.  His white companion followed\nhim to the proscribed compartment, and\nasked him how he felt to be humiliated by\nsuch a coarse fellow.  Mr. Douglass let\nhimself out to the full length of his robust\nmanhood and replied:  \"I feel as if I had \n\n\nFREDERICK DOUGLASS     465 \n\nbeen kicked by an ass.\"  If one will preserve\nhis inner integrity, the ill usage and\ndespiteful treatment of others may heap\nupon him can never penetrate to the holy\nof holies, which remains sacred and inviolable\nto all external assault. \n5.  The fifth lesson which should be\nemphasized in connection with the life of\nMr. Douglass, is that he possessed a ruling\npassion outside the narrow circle of self-interest\nand personal well being.  The love\nof liberty reigned supreme in his soul.  All \ngreat natures are characterized by an enthusiasm\nfor some altruistic principle.  Its \nhighest manifestation is found in the zeal\nfor the salvation of men on the spiritual\nside.  All great religious teachers belong to\nthis class.  Patriots and philanthropists are\nardently devoted to the present well-being\nof man.  The poet, the painter and the\nsculptor indulge in a fine frenzy over contemplataive\nbeauty or its formal expression.\nThe philosopher and the scientist go into\necstacy over the abstract pursuit of truth.\nMinds of smaller caliber get pure delight\nfrom empty pleasure, sportsmanship, or the\ncollection of curious and bric-a-brac.  Even \nthe average man is at his highest level when\nhis whole soul goes out in love for another.\nThe man who lives without altruistic enthusiasm\ngoes through the world wrapped\nin a shroud.\nThere have been few members  of the\nhuman race that have been characterized\nby so intense and passionate a love for liberty\nas Frederick Douglass.  His love for\nliberty was not limited by racial, political\nor geographical boundaries, but included\nthe whole round world.  He believed that\nliberty, like religion, applied to all men\n\"without one plea.\"  He championed liberty\nfor black men; liberty for white men;\nliberty for Americans; liberty for Europeans;\nliberty for Asiatics; liberty for the \n\nwise; liberty for the simple; liberty for the\nweak; liberty for the strong; liberty for \nmen; liberty for women--liberty for all the\nsons and daughters of men.  I do not know \nwhether he permitted his thoughts to wander\ninto planetary space, or speculated as\nto the inhabitability of other worlds than \nours;  but if he did, I am sure that his great \nsoul took them all in his comprehensive\nscheme of liberty.  In this day and time\nwhere the spirit of commercialism and selfish\ngreed command the best energies of the\nage, the influence of such a life to those \nwho are downtrodden and overborne is\ndoubly significant.  Greed for gain has \nnever righted any wrong in the history of\nthe human race.  The love of money is the\nroot, and not the remedy of evil. \n6.  In the sixth place, I would call the\nattention of the young to the danger of forgetting\nthe work and worth of Frederick\nDouglass and the ministration of his life.\nWe live in a practical age, when the things\nthat are seen overshadow the things that\nare invisible.  When did Douglass do, asks\nthe crass materialist?  He built no institution\nand laid no material foundation.  True,\nhe left us no showy tabernacle of clay.\nHe did not aspire to be the pontifex maximus,\nor boss mechanic of the colored race.  \nThe greatest things of this world are not\nmade with hands, but reside in truth and\nrighteousness and love.  Douglass was the\nmoral leader, and spiritual prophet of his\nrace.\nUnless all signs of the times are misleading,\nthe time approaches and is even now\nat hand, which demands a moral renaissance.\nThen, oh for Douglass to arouse \nthe dormant conscience of the white race,\nto awaken the almost incomprehensible\nlethargy of his own people, and to call down\nrighteous wrath of heaven upon injustice\nand wrong. \n\n\n", "188", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00705", "480          THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO \n\nwhich it guarantees, that such government \nis nearing dangerous ground - it matters \nnot whether said neglected citizens belong \nto or represent a popular or unpopular \nclass.

Pace\n\nWhen the Dutch trading vessel unloaded\nits cargo of black men at the little village\nof Jamestown nearly four hundred years \nago, and the settlers were confronted by a\nnew idea--that all men are not created\nwhite and that they are not all equal in\ncivilization--no one could know that the\ngerm of national and world issues were\nwrapped up in their thought.  They could \nnot look down the dim vistas of time and\nsee the idea of the black man's inferiority\nunfold and grow, casting out its branches \nof oppression, pride and hate, and culminating\nin a terrible deadly conflict between\nbrothers of the same race, and furnishing\nabiding room for the fourth and strongest\nbranch--prejudice.  They could not know\nthat from their idea, so insignificant then,\nwould sprout the question, that at the dawn\nof the Twentieth Century stands out as the\none great unsolved question of human life,\nthe question of the attitude of the white\nraces of the world to the darker races.\nHere in America we meet the most vexatious\nform of this question, because we have\na white race and a black race living side by \nside.  Year after year this question has\ngrown more prominent and more urgent of\na solution, and now when, apparently, the\ntime has come when some conclusion must\nbe reached, a ray of hope appears.  The\nUnited States has been reaching out its\narms into the oceans that lave our shores\nand has been drawing unto itself the islands\nthat lie therein.  The significance of this\nto us, arises from the fact that these islands \nare peopled by men of the darker races.\nPorto Rico, whose population is largely\nblack, has been annexed and becomes a part\nof United States territory.  The Philippine\nIslands have been bought from Spain, but\nthe inhabitants of the islands, men of the \n\nbrown and black races, are resisting annexation\nand are fighting for independence.\nBut the struggle will eventually end in favor\nof the United States and the stars and\nstripes will float peacefully over another\nterritory.  This will mean much to America\nfrom both a commercial and a political\nstandpoint.  But we are mainly concerned\nin this paper with the probable influence of\nthe islands and their population upon the\nso-called \"race problem\" of America, for\nwe must all admit that race prejudice is not\nconfined to any one section, but that it exists\nmore or less throughout the United\nStates.\nThe foreigner who comes to America,\nbroken in fortune and even in character, if\nhis face is white, can and does, in time,\nbecome assimilated with the American people,\nand receive \"a white man's chance.\"\nBut the Negro, though he be American\nborn, though he have all the culture that \nAmerica's best institutions can give, must\nalways remain the anomalous quantity, an\nAmerican Negro--a double personality in\none.  And now that the yoke of prejudice\nand oppression is bearing so heavily upon\nhim, there comes, at times, a longing to\nget away from the place where his color\nlimits his opportunities, and to begin life\nover.  Since there has arisen the possibility \nof the Philippine Islands becoming a part of\nthe territory of the United States, many\nblack eyes have been turned longingly toward\nthem.  But the question arises in\ntheir minds, \"Is it better over there? Will \nour condition be made better by moving\nthere?\"  And then the counter-question to\nthis arises--though the first is far from settled--\n\"Will we be bettered because they\nare coming into the American nation?\" \nWriters and travelers tell us daily in the \n\n\nTHE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, ETC.     483\n\nnewspapers and magazines, of the agreeable\nclimate of the islands.  They say that\n\"a an who can live through a summer in\nthe southern states need have no fear of the\nPhilippine summers,\" and that malaria is\nless prevalent in Manila than in the states\nsouth of Maryland.  Surely then the southern\nNegro need not fear from climatic causes.\nThey tell us also of the mixed character\nof the population, that the inhabitants\nare Negritos, Indonesians and Malayans,\nthe Malayans forming a majority of the total\npopulation.  All of these people are of\nthe darker races.  The Negritos are black\nand the others are brown-skinned, resembling \na large class of the mulatto population\nof our own country.  Here then, is a country\nwith an equable climate and with a population\nof about eight millions of people who\nresemble, in many respects, the American\nNegro. Would not assimulation with them \nbe easy and do we not find here our ideal\nhome where prejudice and race discrimination\nare unknown?  Let us see.\nAmerica has been the home of the Negro\nfor three-hundred years, and though some\nof us talk glibly about Africa as the \"Fatherland,\" \nmost of us, both white and black,\nhave come to the conclusion that America\nmust be our \"Homeland,\" if the preference\nlies between Africa and America.  Almost\nevery conceivable tie binds us to\nAmerica.  Here our fathers settled after \nleaving the house of bondage; some acquired\nlarge holdings of real estate, and large\nnumbers interested themselves in projects\nthat they could give up now only at great\nloss.  Moreover, to every one of us there \nare ties of home and of kindred that endear\nus to America and American soil.\nWhite people find this country an ideal one\nfor the development of all that is best in\nthem, and so would we were it not for color\ndiscrimination and prejudice, the fly in the\nointment that spoils the whole.

And when they landed\nin Manila they maltreated the natives and\ncommitted outrages upon them, teaching\nthem to feel that they are inferior to the\nwhite men because they are black or brown.\nAnd so the seeds of prejudice were sown and\ngrew.  When Dewey first entered Manila\nharbor and destroyed the tyrranical Spanish\nrule, he was welcomed with open arms by\nthe natives; and then our army landed, not\nto fight the natives but to protect them.\nHad justice and right been done to the\nbrown people then, there need have been\nno \"Filipino War.\"  A Manila correspondent\nwrote his paper at the time, the following\nsignificant words:  \"Once we allowed\nAguinaldo and the leaders around him to\nbecome convinced that their lot was to be\nthat of the 'nigger' in this country they\nbegan the work which ended in hemming\nour troops in the city of Manila, dependent\nupon their mercy for our very water supply.\nIf the status of the Negro, as they understood \nit, was to be theirs in the new system,\nthey would have to leave the islands,\nanyway, and they had concluded to make a\nfight before going.\"  Here we have the\nseed of discord sown at the very beginning \nof our work in the islands simply because\nthe natives were made to feel the terrible\npressure of color discrimination.

He was ridiculed \nas a \"nigger-lover,\" \"traitor to his \nrace,\" and with many other opprobrious epithets. \nHe pursued his course until he won. \nHis enemies failed to note that Lawyer \nTapp did not love the Negro so, but that he \nloved justice, honor and fair play more. \n\nStrong Words on \"The Industrial Problem\" \n\nMr. Daniel Murray, Assistant Librarian \nat Washington, D. C., wrote an article for \nour September issue, which for grasp of the \nsubject and clearness of view, is in advance \nof any recent article on this important \nsubject. It would be a wise expenditure \nof money and a strong contribution to \nbringing about a right solution to have this \narticle put into pamphlet form and scattered \nbroadcast among our laboring classes by the \nhundred thousand. \n\nNot yielding one iota of his conviction as \nto the value of, and necessity for the classics, \nand for broad, deep and comprehensive \nknowledge of the sciences and reaffirming \nat the same time his loyalty to these \nlines of investigation and his unyielding position \nthat the Negro needs every kind of \neducation that the white man needs, from \nthe pickax to the telescope and from the \nplow to the spectroscope, and also insisting \nthat the door if every educational opportunity \nshall be kept as wide open to the Negro \nas to the white man, the writer is thoroughly \nconvinced by long years of study \nand careful observation, that the battle for \nbread is the battle for life with the race, \nand is therefore the most imminent and \ngreatest battle it has on hand, and consequently \nit takes precedence over all other\nquestions in our social life. \n\nFurther, it must be said that while there \nare representatives among us who forget \none fundamental in their rush after another, \nor who are willing to sell a birthright for a \nmessage of pottage, the discerning ones among \nus would not have the American public to \nthink that we underestimate the citizenship\nof the republic, bought at the enormous \nprice paid in the war and since the war. We \nwant to vote on every question that affects\nthe community in which we live and the \nnation whose unity we helped to preserve.    \n\nThe industrial question is pressing, and \nwithin its many folds are wrapped up the  \nphysical existence of our race. There is a \ndisposition to keep the Negro out of the labor \nunions of the North. The homely language, \nthat \"the kettle cannot call the pot \nblack,\" finds daily illustration in the attitude \nof the \"best whites\" of both sections \nin their attitude towards the Negro. The \n\"best whites\" of the South cannot prevent \nthe lynching of the Negro in the South, \nand the \"best whites\" of the North cannot \nprevent his industrial ostracism at the \nNorth. \n\nBooker Washington's laconic statement, \n\"You cannot lynch the Negroes in the \nwinter and reasonably expect to find them \nready to harvest the various crops in the \nsummer,\" furnishes Mr. Murray with a \ntext to further the industrial situation \namong the race, and also a possible means \nfor checking the crime of lynching. He \nsays: \"If every man, woman and child \nin the country would resolve to go on half \nrations for ten days, giving up every form \nof labor and devote the time to prayer, until \nthe perpetrators were punished, there \nwould not be a second lynching in any \ncounty in the South. The colored people \nhold in their own hands an effective means \nof redress, if they only knew it and were \ndisposed to use it - a means that is peaceable \nand calculated to win the sympathy of \nthe civilized world.\" \n\nOur advice to the race is, DO IT. We \nare not nihilists, or socialists, or anarchists, \nor dynamiters; neither are we rioters, arsonists, \nor labor unionists. Our history is\npathetically monotonous with submission \neven to tyranny and oppression. We have \n \n\n       \n \n\n  \n\n\n    \n \n\n \n \n \n     \n \n     \n \n  \n  \n\n \n   ", "200", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00710", "490     THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO\n\nnot won great battles on our heels with shot\nand shelf, but we have invariably fought\nour greatest battles on our knees through\nprayer.  It is not, therefore, out of keeping\nwith our nature to hear it said in so\nmany words, Negroes! Starve and to your\nknees!! \nPrejudiced rhetoricians have declared\nthat the Negro is not necessary to the industrial\nlife of the South.  The facts of\ncurrent history, as compiled in the Census\ntell a different tale.  The Negro is a necessity \nin the South, and if he is treated half\nway decently he will be happy and prove\nthe truth of the claim, that he is the best\nlaborer in the world.\n\nEx-Communication for Christian (?) Murders\nand Lynchers \nThe Methodist Episcopal Church South,\nStatesboro, Ga., of which the Rev. Whitley\nLangston is pastor, has taken a new step\nforward in its attempt to bring the lynching\nhabit into bad repute.\nIt is on record that the Rev. Mr. Langston\ndid what he could by persuasion to\nhave the mob allow the law to take its\ncourse.  His articles on the riot show him\nto be a humane, high-minded, and law abiding\nChristian gentleman.  His attitude of\nuncompromising opposition to mob law is \ncommended by all loyal citizens of the land.\nThe action of this church in calling upon\nthose members who took part in the lynching\nto withdraw or repent, is painfully\nconfirmatory of what many intelligent\nNegroes know to be well-established\nfacts in this section.  That Christian\nmen, followers of the Divine Savior and believers\nin the brotherhood of man, should \nassist, by presence and sympathy and act,\nin the burning of a culprit, is a revelation\nof uncivilized heathenism, not inferior to\nthe cannibalism of darkest Africa.\nIt is frequently said that the \"best people\"\nof the South do not take part in, nor \n\ndo they approve of lynch law.  The logic\nof the facts in this case, as in many others,\ndoes not sustain this foxy statement.  The\naction of that church requesting all members \nwho participated in this unlawful uprising\nto withdraw, is proof positive that\nthis mob was not made up entirely of the\nrabble.  There were in it some of \"the best\nChristians\" in that town.\nBut how humane after all, is the punishment\nfor mobbists? The nation must understand\nthat \"Before Day Clubs (?)\" are the\nlegitimate children of Ku-kluxism, White-capism,\nWhite Leagues and Lynching Bees.\nWe plead for the utter extinction of all this\nunholy brood of lawlessness.  We commend\nto the public the action of that church\nunder its brave pastor as a step forward towards \noutlawing violence of every kind.\nThe resolutions are as follows: \n\n\"Whereas, Our community has recently passed\nthrough a season of intense excitement, our citizens\nhave been aroused and our town and county thrown\ninto commotion by reason of the deplorable act of\nmob violence enacted in our midst on the 16th of\nAugust, when two Negroes were taken by a mob\nand burned at the stake; \n\"And, Whereas, by reason of this deplorable occurrence\nand shameless violation of the law, our\nchurch has been placed in an unfortunate attitude,\nit being rumored--and perhaps with truth--that\namong the participants in this lynching were a few\npersons whose names are upon the roll of our membership; \nnow, therefore,\n\"Be it resolved, By the official members of the\nMethodist Episcopal Church South, in Statesboro,\nGa., gathered in call session, as follows.\n\"First--We do deeply deplore and in the most\npronounced and forcible terms condemn this act of\nlawlessness.\n\"Second--We desire that our church be placed\non record and make a positive, unquestioned stand\nbefore the public, as being unalterably opposed to\nmob violence in any form; as discountenancing and \ncondeming the act of lynching, and as upholding\nthe authority of the laws of the state in their administration\nthrough our courts.\n\"Third--We regard the act of any one who participated\nin this deplorable affair as being inimical\nto the best interests of our churches, and we recommend \nthat such of our members as participated\ntherein, if any, be hereby apprised of the displeasure \n\n\nIN THE SANCTUM     491 \n\nof the church and be requested to withdraw\nwithout delay from our communion and membership,\nunless a public confession of wrong be made\nwith expression of penitence and contrition.\n\"Fourth--We commend the manly attitude and\nChristian conduct of our pastor, Rev. Whitley\nLangston, towards this affair, as well as that of all \nothers of our members who have been active in\ntheir opposition and condemnation of the lawless\nacts of the mob.\n\"Fifth--We desire that the resolutions be presented\nto the church, to be called in conference,\nand that a vote be taken, at the next Sunday morning\nservice, in order that the church may be placed\nin its true light before the world, as favoring law\nand order and as frowning with strongest condemnation\nupon lawlessness and mob violence.\n\"Sixth--We desire that these resolutions be\ngiven due publicity through the local papers and\nthrough such other papers as may desire to give\nspace to same.\n\"Passed by unanimous vote of official board,\nSeptember 1st, 1904.\n\"J. A. FULCHER, Chairman.\n\"HINTON BOOTH, Secretary.\n\nShall we Support Mr. Taylor and the National\nLiberty Party? \nWe are sure our readers will find the article \nfrom the pen of Hon. George Edwin\nTaylor for which we publish in this number of\nthe magazine interesting to say the least.\nWe invite every one of our subscribers to\ngive Mr. Taylor's article a careful perusal.\nWhile we cannot sanction the new political\nparty as a wise move at this time, still we\nrecognized that it is the outgrowth of the\nconditions that prevail in this country at\nthe present time.  The Democratic party\nhas always been the enemy of the colored\nman.  Every Negro of any sense whatever\nmust recognize this to be a fact.  The Republican\nparty which was born out of the \nconscience of the nation and which came\ninto existence to check slavery and champion\nhuman rights, has of late been very\ncareless as to how the Negro was treated in\nthis country.  Thus, the colored man found\nhimself between the devil and the deep blue\nsea.  It was natural that in his hour of\ndespondency he should turn to his own \n\nrace.  The protest is legitimate and under\nother circumstances, would merit support. \nBut it cannot be denied that the Republican\nparty is infinitely more just to the Negro\nthan the Democratic party.  We are \napproaching a crisis in the history of the\nrace and the nation.  Mr. Taylor's party\nhas no hope of electing this year.  Most of\nthe colored people are Republicans, and\nin this case Mr. Taylor expects to\ndraw from the Republican vote just\nas Mr. Watson expects to draw from\nthe Democrats.  The triumph of the\nDemocrats this fall would be nothing\nshort of a calamity to the race and nation.\nNot only would hard times be ushered in\nbut the most reckless age of lynchings and\nterrorism the world has ever known would\nstrike the South.  The Tartarean cloud of\nVardamanism hangs over every village and\nhamlet and country log cabin in Dixie\nwhere a son of Ham resides.  The humiliations\nnow heaped upon us are insignificant\ncompared to those that would then be meted \nout to us.  It is plain here that it is the\nduty of Mr. Taylor, and every one of our\nNorthern black brethren to throw themselves\nin line for Roosevelt.  He stands for \nequal rights for all men.  He swears that,\nas far as he is able in the limits of the Constitution,\nwe shall have justice and fair play.\nWe believe he will goad his luke-warm\nparty to action, when once elected by the\nAmerican people.  At present to follow\nThe National Liberty Party, would be\nequivalent to cutting off our noses to spite\nour face.  Let the black people from darkest\nMississippi to Maine understand the\nsituation.  We are approaching a crisis in\nthe history of our race and country.  Remember\nDoddsville, Statesboro and Cedartown.\nRegister and pay your taxes today,\nand in November go to the polls and vote\nfor Roosevelt and good government.  Yes,\nyour vote will be counted.

Got something to say? Can you come straight to the point and say it with a punch? If that's the case, there's good news for you.\n     Now if the time for people in our group to tell the world what's on their minds. That was not always the case. Not so many years ago the average publisher was by no means interested in manuscripts which colored writers brought to present their point of view. If the manuscript was well written by an author who had something interesting to say, and honest publisher might save his conscience by telling the writer \"I'm not denying that you've done a good job all right in presenting your facts, but we just can't publish it because it is too controversial.\" \n     In those degenerate days both the publishers of books and the editors of magazines and newspapers really overworked the word \"Controversial\". There is no telling how many sins these literary Moguls committed in the name of \"Controversial.\" But now, Ye Prospective Authors, all that has changed. \nBe of good cheer. If anybody tells you \"the good day is coming\", tell that prophet he is mistaken, that the good day for you is not COMING it has already come.  For a long time publishers have been printing [writing] books by colored authors. What was once rejected by publishers because it was considered controversial is not accepted with open arms.  \n     This about face has come not because publishers have been converted and are now playing the role of saints, but because they know the public is intensely interested in books about colored people, good, bad or indifferent, whether they rebel against the conditions under which they are forced to live or take it lying down. So great has been the interest in books about colored people of the U.S.A. which the public had manifested that some of the best writers in the dominant race have shown plainly that they are unwilling to let this subject be monopolized exclusively by colored authors and for a long time they have been writing about it themselves. A list of some of the best sellers which have appeared during the last few years would be sure to in-\n[*2*]\nclude books about colored people which have been written by white authors. Sinclair Lewis had no sooner put Kingsblood Royal on the market a short time ago than Kathleen Crawford, a Virginian, launched her Straw Fire, which has just appeared. This novel tells the story of a Southern girl who rejects the traditions and customs of the South and horrifies her family by presiding at an interracial meeting. This book is full of dilemmas which constantly face those who try to be fair to all races. A comparatively short time ago such a novel would have been rejected by the majority of publishers because it would have been considered too controversial. \n     And so it is clear that manuscripts are no longer rejected by publishers because of the opinions on the Race Problem they present or because of the delineation of the character and conduct of individuals in the group, no matter how outstanding, queer or questionable they may be. If those in our group who want to be authors, clearly and cogently they stand a good chance to succeed.

After people have been freed it is a cruel injustice to call\nthem by the name they bore as slaves. It is painful and shocking indeed\nthat those in our group who have enjoyed educational opportunities; that\nthose in an organization which repudiated the word \"Negro\" forty years ago\nshould continue to [remind their group of the name they bore in this country\nand the whole world should continue to] use the slave term and thereby increase \nthe difficulties of their group in their effort to reach the worthy\ngoal toward which they strive.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the women of the race will do everything in their \npower to correct this serious mistake.\n\n\n2\nIn the second place I object to the word Negro because our meanest detractors\nand most cruel persecutors insist that we shall be called by that name, so that they can\nhumiliate us by referring contemptuously to us as \"Niggers\" or \"Negras\" as Bilbo used to d\nSome of our group say they will continue to classify us as Nrgroes, until an individual referred \nto as such will be proud of that name.  But that is a case of wishful thinking and\nnothing else.  For the moment one hears the word \"Negro\" in this country instantly, automatically, \nin his mind's eye he sees a human being who is ignorant,  segregated, discrimnated\nagainst, considered inferior and objectionable on general principles from every point of \nview.  God alone knows how long it will takefor our group to rise to such heights under prevailing conditions of race prejudice in this\nprejud ice-ridden country that a representative of it will be PROUD to be called a Negro.\nThat would be double, back action, super-duper miracle indeed!\n     Several months ago a distinguished man of the dominant race wrote his views on\nthis point to the New York Herald Tribune.  The letter follows:  \"Granting that racial prejudice \nis taking a fearful toll on the nation's productivity, admitted that this discrimination \nis a blighting mockery to our professions as a Christian country and a damning reproach \nto our one-world leadership, what are we going to do about it?\"\n     There is one simple thing that all Americans who love their country can do about\nit.

Emulating the example\nof the famous Captain Cuttle, when\nfound, I made a note on't.  When people \nlook for things they usually find them.\nSometimes they see what they want and\nsometimes they don't.  In my case I saw\nboth.  In Germany I saw women as fair\nas lilies, with flaxen hair and blue eyes,\nliving under physical conditions much\nworse than those under which three-fourths\nof the colored women of this\ncountry live.  I saw these same women\nsubjected to a degradation which is quite\nas appalling and shameful as that to which\nmany of our women are reduced in the\nSouth, with no hope, apparently, of improvement \nor redress. \nIn Germany an army officer may betray\na girl who belongs to one of the best families\nin the Kingdom without fear of incurring\npunishment of any kind.  It does\nnot affect his status or stand in the way\nof his promotion at all.  The girls in the\nmiddle and poorest classes, the peasant\ngirls, are considered the rightful prey of\noth the officers and the men in the\nanks.  An intelligent German woman \nho had made a study of the subject told\ne when I was in Berlin, that many of\nthe peasant women who live in the country\nbecome mothers as often as possible, so\nthat they may go to the cities and secure \nthe position of wet nurse for some wealthy\ninfant.  It is merely a business transaction\nwith these women, and the people as\na whole take it as a matter of course.\nWhen the peasant mother goes to her\nwealthy charge in the city she entrusts\nher own infant to the tender mercies of a\nwoman who makes it her business to look\nafter these deserted waifs.  But so many\nof these poor babies die from neglect that\nthe presiding genuises of these baby-farms\nare commonly called in German\n\"Engelmacherinen,\" which means angel-makers.\nIn Germany I saw women, young and\nold, hitched to dogs drawing milk\ncarts and wagons of various descriptions\nthrough the streets.  I saw them ploughing\nin the fields and doing all manner of\nheavy, laborious work out of doors, until\neight or nine o'clock at night.  I saw\nwomen, young and old, with great high\nbaskets strapped to their backs, the contents\nof which were so heavy that the\nburden bearers were almost bowed to the\nground.  When I was returning from a\nvisit to the palace at Potsdam, in which\nthe Emperor and Empress sometimes\nlive, I saw three of these German women\nbent almost double with the weight of the\nbaskets and their contents.  As I stopped\nto look in pity and horror at this crime\nagainst nature and unborn generations, a\nstreet car conductor, who saw how the\nspectacle affected me, called out, \"Don't\nworry, my lady, that's what women are\ngood for.\" \nIn London and Liverpool it is almost\nimpossible to walk a dozen blocks without\nseeing a woman so intoxicated that she\ncan hardly stand up.  As one rides on the\ntop of busses, he can not pass a salooon\nwithout seeing women, young and old,\nrich and poor, crowding around the bar,\neither drinking or waiting to get a drink.\nIt is by no means uncommon to see young\nmen and young ladies, some of whom do\nnot appear to be more than sixteen, entering \n\nbar rooms, while they are out for\nan afternoon or an evening stroll.  Not\nonce but often have I seen a mother with\na baby in her arms and three or four other\nchildren hanging to her skirts take her\nentire family into a barroom, so that she\nmight get a drink.  On one Sunday night\nin particular, about eleven o'clock, I saw\nat least half a dozen women who were \nreeling from one side of the street to\nanother, each of whom was dragging\nalong a little child, who was crying as\nthough it would break its little heart.\nIn Liverpool I saw such degraded,\npitiable, wretched and ragged women as\nI have never seem anywhere else on earth.\nMany of these women wore such little\nclothing that I found myself wondering\nwhether there was a law in England\nagainst indecent exposure of person.\nWhen they fought with one another, as\nthey oocasionally did, neither the policemen\nnor the passers-by paid any more at\ntention to them than if they had been two\ndogs engaging in the same sport.  They\nmade no effort whatever either to separate\nor to stop them.  In none of my travels, \neither in the North or in the South, have \nI ever seen colored women, no matter how\nignorant or degraded they were, so devoid\nof self respect and natural, womanly pride\nas were some English women I saw.  Of\ncourse these were not representataive\nwomen, but they belong to a race\nwhich has had centuries of educa\ntion, culture and refinement back of it,\nwith a wealth of opportunity ever present\nwith it.  These women belong to a race\nwhich boasts of its great superiority over \nall other races on the face of the earth.\nTheir brothers on this side of the ocean,\nin the South, rarely lose an opportunity\nof casting slurs upon the moral character\nof the women whom their forefathers debauched\nfor nearly three hundred years,\nand who are protected from the lust of the\npresent generation neither by public sentiment\nnor by law.\nThe statistics concerning the immorality \nof women in several foreign countries\nwhich were presented in both the International\nCouncil and the Internationa\nCongress, which recently met in Berlin,\nwere appalling.  If the figures were authentic,\nas I am sure they were, the\ncolored women of this country are models\nof virtue and propriety compared with\nsome of their misguided, sorely tempted \nand sinful sisters in foreign lands.  In instituting \nthis comparison the record of\nthe colored women of this country appears\nall the more remarkable, when one considers\nthe depths from which they have\ncome and the obstacles to virtue and correct\nliving which some of our most prepossessing\nand promising young women\nare obliged to surmount. \nI take no pleasure in the shame\nor the misfortune of any woman,\nno matter what her color, her condition or\nher class.  These facts about the immorality\nof white women abroad are not presented\nin a spirit of malice.  They are\ngiven to show that there are a few things\nat least, for which we, as a race, may be\nthankful.  It is possible for an innocent\nman to be accused of a crime so much\nthat he is almost persuaded to believe in\nhis guilt himself.  The lack of self-respect\nin the race to-day may be directly\ntraced to the low estimate placed upon its\nmental ability and its moral character by\nthose who are identified with it as well as\nthose who are not.  It is refreshing every\nnow ans then to see that we possess a few\npoints of superiority after all.\nWashington, D.

To a colored women who has\nstudied and traveled in England and who\nhas associated with English people, both\nin their own country and on the continent, \nthis information is more than surprising--\nit is sensational.  To a colored American,\nwho has not only good friends among\nthe English people herself, but who knows\nthe relationship existing between other\nmembers of her race and the very flower \nof the British stock, it would seem that\nthe leopard could change his spots or the\nAfrican his skin quite as easily as the\nEnglish could be so completely revolutionized \nin their feelings and attitude toward \nthe negro. \nColored people have been received socially\nby English people from the late\nQueen Victoria right on down the line,\ntime out of mind.  Intermarriage between\npersons of African and English extraction\nhas not been rare.  Samuel Coleridge Taylor,\none of the greatest musicians whom\nEngland has ever produced, is the son of\na full blooded African and an English \nwoman.

In relating the interesting \nfeatures connected with sojourn\nin Great Britain, Mr. Douglass used to\nsay that while he was cordially welcomed\nand graciously treated by the wealthiest\nand most cultured people in England,\nwhen he was entertained by the British\naristocracy and royalty, he forgot completely\nthat he was a negro.\nme years ago a beautiful young col- \nd American, with a rich brown complexion,\nhair as black as a raven, and a\nvoice as sweet as a lark's, married an\nEnglishman, possessed of a snug little\nfortune.

The English women rushed in\nsuch crowds to see them, and some of\nthese women were so infatuated with\nthese dusky Apollos that the authorities\nhad to take the matter in hand, so as to\nprevent their sisters from making such a \nspectacle of themselves.

I was studying in Berlin, as \nyou know, and was very comfortably situated\nin a German pension for a year,\" \nsaid Miss Kirk.  \"Then my mother and\nbrother came over to spend the summer\nwith me, and after we had taken a little\nspin through France and Switzerland,\nthey took the steamer for home, and I\nreturned to Berlin.  The very day I reached\nBerlin, I met several of my college\nchums; one was a classmate at Oberlin,\nin fact.  They insisted that I should board\nat Fraulein von Finck's where they were.\nThey had frequently asked me to join\ntheir party before, but I had always refused\non the ground that I had come to\nBerlin to study German, and I knew full\nwell that if I were under the same roof\nwith my old friends I would waste precious\nmoments chatting English that\nshould be spent in mastering the German\ngutturals.  Well, the girls finally persuaded\nme to come with them, and assured\nme that they would see to it that \nI spoke English only on holidays and festivals. \nFraulein von Finck's pension was\nfilled with Americans, most of whom\nwere studying music.  There was a goodly\nsprinkling of Southerners among them,\nbut I didn't think of that when I decided\nto cast my lot among them.\n\"I had scarcely settled myself at Fraulein\nvon Finck's before I noticed that\ntwo young men observed me closely every\ntime I came to the table.  There was nothing\nfriendly in their glances, and it dawned\nupon me suddenly that they were not\nat all happy when I appeared upon the\nscene.  To make along story short, after\nI had been at my new pension for about\na month, Fraulein von Finck asked me to\ncome to her room one afternoon, saying\nthat she wanted to see me about something.\nWith a woman's infallible intuition, \nparticularly a colored women's under\nsuch circumstances, I knew exactly\nwhat was the matter.  Incidentally I had\nlearned that these two young men, who\nhad looked at me in such a disagreeable\nway, were from the South and were studying\nmedicine. \n\nA Painful Interview.\n\" 'Are you a negro, Frauleini Kirk?\" said\nFraulein von Finck, as soon as I entered\nthe room.  She appeared very much agitated\nand excited.\n\" 'Why do you ask me such a question?\"\nsaid I after the manner of Yankees, who \nanswer a question by asking another.\n\" 'Well,' said Fraulein von Finck, 'the \ntwo young doctors from Haltmore tell me\nthat you are a negro, and they say that \nmy pension will be ruined if I accommodate \nnegroes.  No decent, self-respecting\nAmerican will board where negroes are\naccommodated, they say.  I then reminded\nthem that you had at least a half-dozen\nAmerican friends right in the\nhouse, who had prevailed upon you to\ncome here, so as to be with them. The\nthe Haltmore doctors told me that there \nwere a few cranks in America who\nthought so little of themselves that they\nassociated with negroes, but they assured\nme that the best people in the United\nStates would no sooner consent to come\nin close social contact with the negro than\nthe best people of Germany would mingle\nsocially with the Jew.  The herr doctor\ntells me also that negroes cannot secure\naccommodations at hotels in \nUnited States; cannot sit by white peo\nin the churches or in the theaters \nany other place of amusement.

Words simply failed the public, when it talked about them as housekeepers.\nIt was enough to make angels weep to behold the awful houses kept by\nwomen with college degrees, people declared.\nAnd as for cooking! Of course college-trained women knew nothing whatever\nabout that. Women who had studied the higher mathematics, the sciences and\nGreek had so violated the laws of nature that it was never possible for them\nto learn to do well the work which the divine plan had ordained they should do.\nSo far as I myself was concerned I made up my mind definitely that I\nwould prove all these charges against college-bred women were false. In the\nfirst place, I would dress as well as I could. I would not wear shoes run\ndown at the heel, as the blue-stocking ladies were accused of doing. I would\nnot walk around the streets with a portion of the hem of my skirt ripped and\nI would try to select becoming hats.

There one of the officers consented \nto let me have his room on a one class steamer for $80, so that the problem\nwhich at one time had assured threatening proportions was thus easily solved.\n\nA short while before the steamer sailed from Baltimore my little six-year\nold who with her father had gone there to see me off begged me to take hr\nher with me. I was never more tempted to do anything in my life than I was to\ngrant her request.

Perhaps they\ncan tell you where the \"Negerin\" is.\" \"But the women from the United States\nwe have approached dont speak German well enough for us to talk with them.\"\nthey would usually complain. Finally, a dear little newspaper woman came to me\nand implored me to let her know the minute the Negerin arrived, so that she\nmight have the first interview with her. I could not resist the temptation to\nconfess then and there on the spot that I was the individual she sought. Her\njoy wasgreat indeed, but her surprise was greater.

You can not be absolutely sure when viewing the exterior, whether you are in the presence of a white man or a black man. The greatest character of the ages said to the carping critics of his day, \"Ye are like unto whited sepulchres which indeed appear beautiful outward but are within full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.\" They were, I suppose, what in modern parlance would be called black-hearted. They say the black man came from the curse of Ham by his father, Noah, away back just after the flood; but later developments of this scientific age show either that the curse is being removed by the will of the Almighty in his dispensation of modern civilizing influences, or that it was formerly misinterpreted. Let us hope, at least that that curse, if upon any one, was upon those who were black inside. But I did not start to give you a homily, but rather to tell you in good plain English, what one of the blackest of men, externally, saw in the land of some of the whitest of men, externally. \nI was reared a traveler. My first lessons in the world were in traveling\u2014running errands. I early evinced a desire to travel far and wide in this world. My neighbors undoubtedly\n293", "219", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00730", "296                   Church Review.\n\ncongregation, if not the more elegant and fashionable services.\nIndeed, our services were of the good old Methodist style. We\npreached, prayed, sang, had the mourners' bench, some\ngot converted, many got happy, and we literally fulfilled\nthat Scripture which says\" \"Cry out and shout,\nthou inhabitant of Zion, for great is the Holy One\nof Israel in the midst of thee.\" I have no doubt \nthe day of reckoning will show that good was done by our\nservices on that voyage. I gained among them the title of\n\"The African Prince,\" and as I was the only black man on\nboard, I suppose the condition was quite changed from the old\ndays of slavery. It was a great privilege to preach Christ\namong these people as we sailed over the deep blue sea. After\na voyage of seven days of varied experiences, we dropped\nanchor in the Mersey at Liverpool. A short sojourn was made\namong our English cousins, then we took shipping at the seaport\ntown of Hull, to cross the North sea. The voyage from\nHull to Gottenburg was uneventful and consumed about two\ndays. On our arrival a crowd filled the quay of the quaint\nSwedish town and many rushed wildly on board our ship. I\nseemed to be the center of attraction or, as one might say, the\nlion of the occasion. If I walked toward the bow of the boat\nthe crowd rushed in that direction, and if I wended my way\ntoward the stern, the crowd sternly followed.\n\nI began to quake. It looked as though it might be dangerous\nto land. What was I to do? After a time, however, they\nlearned that the hue of my skin was not put on for the occasion\nand that I was not to blame for being black. The Ethiopian\ncannot change his skin any more than the leopard can change\nhis spots, or the Swede his flaxen hair. Finally they assumed\na more friendly attitude toward me, and I went on shore, persuaded\nthat God had not only made of one blood all nations of\nmen, but also of one heart, even if he had not made them all\nof one skin. I had hardly set foot on their soil, however, when\none man approached me and said, \"Huru star det till?\" I\n\nWhat A Black Man Saw.                297\n\nthought he said, \"You story tell.\" I did not relish being called \na liar; minister though I am, my Yankee blood was up. I said:\n\"You are mistaken, I am not the man.\" Still he repeated\n\"Hur star det till?\" I think he had a few J's and other consonants\nstuck around in his expression somewhere. I kept as\ncool as I could under the circumstances and answered him,\n\"What about?\" He still insisted on it \"Huru star det ill?\" and\nreached out his hand. I thought he was about to attempt to\narrest me and so I assumed a daring attitude of pugilistic defence.\nAt this juncture of affairs a friend near by came to my\nrelief, saying, \"The man is simply saying, 'How do you do?' \"\n\nWhether I was fully sanctified I will not say, certainly I was \nnot fully posted in the language and etiquette of these brothers\nbeyond the North sea.\n\nIt was a new revelation to me to land and tread the narrow\nstreets of Gottenburg. This is the second city of the Scandinavian\npeninsula, having a population of about 100,000. It\nis situated on the west coast of Sweden, east of the north point\nof the Denmark peninsula. It is an enterprising and very beautiful\ncity, and was founded by Gustavus Adolphus about 1620.\nIts mercantile interests are considerable, its museum invites\nexamination, and its horticultural gardens are worthy of note.\nThe chief park is very beautiful, having many specimens of\ntropical trees and shrubbery, which one would suppose could\nnot be grown in such a climate. Gottenburg is visited in the\nsummer season by many tourists from southern climes. One\nsees all kinds of funny people there and hears all kinds of\nfunny languages. The Swedish language itself to me recalls\nto mind the incident said to have caused its origin. It is as\nfollows:\n\nOf course, we are supposed to know that all languages\noriginated at the Tower of Babel when God, becoming displeased\nwith his children's attempt to build the great tower\nto the skies, scattered them by the confusion of tongues that he\ncreated amongst them. It is said that the Swedish tongue", "221", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00732", "300                     Church Review.\n\nwhich, in its form and operations, exacted a larger amount\nof these qualities than the people possessed.\n\nAlthough sovereignty is, by our own form of government,\nlodged in the hands of the people, and they are rightly recognized\nas the source of all power and authority, yet, I think\nthat no unprejudiced mind can study the lives and opinions of\nthe framers of the Constitution, without a conviction that\nthey, to some extent, entertained doubts and misgivings in regard\nto the capacity of the masses to exercise all the functions\nthat belong to sovereignty.\n\nOurs is the most complicated government that exists;-in\nits ongoings, questions of the most difficult character are arising,\nrequiring for their solution the most extensive information,\nthe maturest deliberation and the soundest judgment. It\nis no offset to the ignorance of the people to say that these\nquestions are discussed by able men in their hearing, for every\none knows that it requires a degree of knowledge almost equal\nto that of the one who discusses a question to be able to follow\nhim in the ramifications of his argument, to logically and\nscientifically analyze his statements and then to form a correct\nopinion of what has been discussed. Too often, we must\nconfess, our people fall short of this ability.\n\nHow many of our people are there who read the papers\nregularly and keep posted in regard to the trend of public\nthought as it effects these questions? It is lamentably surprising\nto note what little interest is manifested on the part of\neven the most intelligent of us in these questions as they come\nup from day to day, to say nothing of our lack of appreciation\nof the maturer thoughts expressed by writers in the flood of\nmonthly magazines.\n\nAgain, it requires no little degree of intelligence to properly\ncast our votes, under the present system of voting, which in\nitself a practical disfranchisement of at least one-third or\nprobably more of our people in Virginia. No one who voted\nat the last election failed to recognize this fact.\n\nA Thought For The Times.                         301\n\nIn view of the countless instances of this kind arising on account\nof ignorance, it must be plain to every reflecting mind\nthat the diffusion of a higher degree of knowledge than that\nwhich has generally been regarded sufficient for the masses,\nis a condition not only of our prosperity, but of our existence\nas a free people.\n\nI know not to what other source the patriot can hopefully\nlook for a solution of our present difficulties, but to the returning\nsober sense of the people, awakened through a diffusion of\na higher and purer knowledge.\n\nI know not from what other source can come a remedy\nfor our political ills. Shall we look for relief to our National \nCongress? What are the scopes transpiring there? The\npatriot turns away with despondency from its halls to renew\nhis hopes in the contemplation of the virtue and intelligence of\nthe people; and if he finds not these, well may he despair. But\nwhen we turn to the masses, how much do we find to disquiet\nus! How much of ignorance! how much of unbridled passion!\n\nUnless intelligence and virtue shall go forth among the\nmasses of society, the one to enlighten the public mind, the\nother to distill its soft and gentle influences into the public\nheart, the bulwarks of the Constitution, so dear to us, must\nrapidly give way, one after another, and this once hopeful\nRepublic presently go down among the things that have been\nand are not.\n\nWe must look to the intelligence and moral character of the\npeople. To teach the masses to read and write and to cast up\nthe figures of an account, is to effect something valuable. It\nis a step forward in the right direction; but this is an amount\nof knowledge that falls far short of the responsibilities of\nthose who are sovereigns, and who are practically, in the\nworking of the government, invested with the highest functions\nof sovereignty.\n\nIt is our duty, then, to diffuse a higher and purer education\namong our people. Without it we cannot hope to hold our", "223", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00733", "302              Church Review.\n\nown, to say nothing of going forward in the great development\nsurrounding us. Say what we will, we can never hope to\nrise above the intellectual standard we have ourselves established.\nIgnorance cannot rule over intelligence.\n\nGoing back to my subject, while I do not approve of any\nunjust laws to deprive the Negro of the right to vote, I do approve\nof any fair laws that will limit the suffrage, if those laws\nbe based upon the proper knowledge of the use of the ballot,\nthis knowledge being founded upon virtue as well as upon\nintelligence.\n\nI realize how difficult it would be to frame such laws, for\nas we look out upon the political arena, we see it dominated\nby fraud and chicanery, such a hold has corrupting influences\nupon the machinery of some of the municipal governments\nof our country that it seems impossible to rescue them.\n\nBut as hopeful citizens, believing in the integrity of our\ncountry, let us patiently labor and wait, trusting in the forward\nand onward march of civilization to bring all things\nright.\n\nF.D. WHEELOCK.\n\nAmong Old Books.                    303\n\nIII.\nAMONG OLD BOOKS.-THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF\nIGNATIUS SANCHO.\n\nNot very long ago a friend places in my hand a quaint old\nvolume yellow with age, scarred by hard knocks and torn\nasunder in the middle. A careless glance at its pages added to\nmy first impulse to lay it aside unread, for the text contained\nthe old-fashioned f-like s-es of the last century. But the\namusing result of my attempt to decipher a few lines led me\non till suddenly I discovered I had stumbled upon a book of\nabsorbing interest, and a very rare one besides. Turning back\nto the title page, I saw these words: \"Letters of the Late\nIgnatius Sancho, an African. To which are prefixed Memoirs\nof His Life.\" The date of publication was 1784, and this was\nthe third edition. Facing the page was an oval cut of a man\nof color.\n\nI was soon immersed in the story of his life as told by the\nnameless editor of a worthy record of a remarkable man. The\npleasure I enjoyed shall be shared with the readers of the\nReview; and that it may lose nothing of its quaintness and\nstately dignity, the account given in the exact words of the\nauthor:\n\n\"Quamvis ille niger, quamvis tu candidus effet.\"-Virgil.\n\nThe extraordinary Negro, whose Life I am about to write,\nwas born A.D. 1729, on board a ship in the Slave-trade, a\nfew days after it had quitted the coast of Guinea for the Spanish\nWest Indies; and, at Carthagena, he received from the\nhand of the Bishop, Baptism, and the name of Ignatius.\n\nA disease of the new climate put an early period to his", "224", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00736", "308             Church Review.\n\norchard to gather fruit for an individual appetite,-he either\nerrs by gathering more than he can consume, or else, having\nmade selection, he looks back to find that what he left ungathered\nseems fairer than his choosing.\n\nHere is an extract of mingled moralizing and mirth by\nSancho that you will, nay, must, enjoy:\n\nLord! what is man? and what business have such lazy, lousy, paltry\nbeings of a day to form friendships or to make connections? Man is\nan absurd animal-yea, I will ever maintain it-in his vices, dreadful;\nin his few virtues, silly; he has religion without devotion, philosophy\nwithout wisdom, the divine passion (as it is called) love too oft without\naffection, and anger without cause; friendship without reason; hate\nwithout reflection; knowledge (like Ashley's punch in small quantities)\nwithout judgment; and wit without discretion.\n\nI give it under my hand and mark that the best receipt for your\naching head (if not the only thing that will cure you) is cutting off\nyour hair. I know it is not ton, but when ease and health stand on the\nright, ornament and fashion on the left, it is by no means the ass\nbetween tow loads of hay-why not ask counsel about it?\n\nAbsalom had saved his life but for his hair. You will reply, \"Caesar\nwould have drowned but the length of hair afford to hold the friendly\nhand that drew him to shore.\" Art at this happy time imitates nature\nso well in both sexes that, in truth, our own growth is but of little consequence.\nTherefore, my dear M--, part with your hair and headaches\ntogether. Pope had the headache vilely; Spencer, I have heard, suffered\nmuch from it; in short, it is ail of true geniuses.\n\nIn a letter on March 21, 1770, to his friend M--, he writes\nas follows:\n\n\"He who cannot stem his anger's tide\nDoth a wild horse without a bridle ride.\"\n\nIt is, my dear M--, the same with the rest of our passions; we\nhave reason given us for our rudder, religion is our sheet anchor, our\nfixed star hope, conscience our faithful monitor, and happiness the\ngrand reward. We all in this manner can preach up trite maxims;\nAsk any jackass the way to happiness, and, like me, he will give vent\nto picked-up common-place sayings; but mark how he acts-just as\nyou and I do,-content with acknowledging a slight acquaintance with\nwisdom, but ashamed of appearing to act under her sacred guidance.\n\nReason, where are thou? You see by this how much easier it is to\npreach than to do? But stop,-we know good from evil; and, in\nserious truth, we have powers sufficient to withstand vice, if we choose\nto exert ourselves. In the field, if we know the strength and situation\nof the enemy, we place outposts and sentinels, and take every prudent\nmethod to avoid surprise. In common life we must do the same; and,\nin truth, my honest friend, a victory gained over passion, immorality\nand pride deserves Te Deums better than those gained in the fields of\nambition and blood.\n\nMr. Sancho makes frequent reference to his color and the\ndisabilities arising therefrom; but though often pained, he is\nnever bitter; sometimes, in fact, playful. In one epistle, he\nspeaks as follows:\n\nAmong Old Books.                              309\n\nHappy, happy lad! what a fortune is thine! Look around upon the\nmiserable fate of almost all of our unfortunate color. Superadded to\nignorance, see slavery and the contempt of those very wretches who\nroll in affluence from our labors; superadded to this woeful catalogue,\nhear the ill-bred and heart-racking abuse of the foolish vulgar.\n\nTo a Mr. B----, he writes thus vivaciously of a boy of his\nown color in whom he seems to have taken great interest:\n\nDear Sir:-If I knew a better man than yourself, you would not\nhave this application, which is in behalf of a merry, clean, tight and\nlight little fellow with a woolly pate and a face as dark as your humble;\nGuinea-born and French-bred-the sulky gloom of Africa dispelled by\nGallic vivacity, and that softened again with English sedateness-a\nrare fellow! rides well, and can look upon a couple of horses-dresses\nhair in the present taste-shaves light-and understands something of\nthe arrangement of a table and sideboard. His present master will\nauthenticate his a decent character; he leaves him at his own\n(Blacky's) request. He has served him three years and, like Teague,\nwould be glad of a master, if any good master would be glad of\nhim.\n\nAs I believe you associate chiefly with good-hearted folks, it is\npossible your interest may be of service to him. I like the rogue's\nlooks, or a similarity of color should not have induced me to recommend\nhim.\n\nHe was a great admirer of Garrick, the famous actor, and\nconstantly speaks of him in the highest terms. To one of his\ncorrespondents he says, \"As to your noble friend, Mr. Garrick\n-his virtues are above all praises; he has not only the best\nhead in the world, but the best heart also; he delights in doing\ngood.\" And again, \"Read Mr. Garrick's letter night and\nmorning; put it next to your heart; impress it on your memory,\nand may the God of all mercy give you grace to follow his\nfriendly dictates.\"\n\nNothing, perhaps, is more pathetic than the few words of\nthanks he breathes to a friend for kindness shown to members\nof his race. Hear him:\n\nI thank you for your kindness to my poor black brethren. I flatter\nmyself you will find them not ungrateful-they act commonly from\ntheir feelings; I have observed a dog will love those who use him\nkindly; and surely, if so, negroes in their state of ignorance and\nbondage will not act less generously. If I may judge by myself, I\nshould suppose kindness would do any thing with them; my soul melts\nat kindness, but the contrary-I own with shame-makes me almost\na savage.\n\nSancho appears through his letters in so many roles that one\nis tempted to think of him as \"myriad-minded\"-he is courtier,\npatriot, gallant, grocer, statesman, moralist, punster, wit,\npoetaster, art and literary critic.", "227", 98, 98, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-001:00708", "Friday  Jan  22\nnot referring to his marriage\nso much but to his conduct at\nHampton.

As the last word of God or as the last word\nof man-in either case they are such as should be treasured up\nin the book of our memory. As the word of God, it is as\nthough He had said: I am done now. Henceforth hear what\nthe Spirit saith to the churches.\n\nAs the word of man, it is as though he had said: Hear not\nonly what nature, science, etc., say through their wisest interpreters,\nbut hear what the Spirit says to the churches.\n\n\"He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit\nsaith to the churches.\"\n\nHe that hath an ear. The body is an organism. It has\nmany members. Our text refers to one, the ear. Nor is this\nreference to be looked upon as merely incidental, for the contrary\nof this on the part of great secular writers is not altogether\nwithout reason. Would Seneca aim to teach a lesson,\nquite similar to the lesson of the inspired Apostle, he does not\nuse the ear as the illustration. On the contrary he says:\n\nThe Glory of the Ear.                 327\n\n\"What if the hands should wish to injure the feet, or the eyes\nthe hands? As all the members agree together because it is\nthe interest of the whole that each should be kept safe, so men\nspare their fellow-men because we are born for heaven, and\nsociety cannot be saved except by the love and protection of\nits elements.\"\n\nAnd so speaks Marcus Aurelius. \"We have been born for\nmutual help,\" says he, \"like the feet, like the hands, like the\nrows of upper and lower teeth.\"\n\nEven Pope is heard to say:\n\n\"What if the foot, ordained the dust to tread,\nOr hand, to toil, aspired to be the head?\nWhat if the head, the eye or ear repined\nTo serve mere engines to the ruling mind?\"\n\nIn no one of these, whether Christian or pagan, is any precedence\ngiven the ear.

Hear ye the word of the\nLord, is the word of Moses, the first of God's prophets. Hear\nye the word of the Lord, is the word of John, the last.\n\nThe ear is the member of moment. The power of hearing,\nthe power of all. And wherefore this? Why the glory of\nthe ear?\n\nOur answer to this inquiry, will constitute our first proposition:\n\nI. Wherein is the glory of the ear?\n\nWe answer: Man is lost. Let us break that commonplace\nexpression up and see what it means. Man is lost; that is, he\nhas wandered away from God; wandered away from home.\nMan was made to dwell in God. The Divine presence was to\nbe his home. But alas, he has wandered away-wandered\nuntil he has lost himself in the mazes of sin.

Were this possible\nthen would he not be lost, in any true sense. But so far has he\nwandered; so devious the ways he has gone; so sharp the corners\nhe has turned, that in so far as helping him to return to\nGod and to home is concerned, he is as blind as are those who\nnever saw. In so far then as the eye is concerned, man is\nhopelessly undone.\n    And so it is with the sense of touch. Having broken his\nconnection with God, he is, as the word goes, \"out of all\ntouch\" with Him. The condition of man, as it relates to God,\nand as described in Scripture is, that he is dead-\"dead in\ntrespasses and in sin;\" and from the dead, as we know, all\nsense of feeling has departed. Therefore, in so far as his return\nto God is concerned, he has nothing to hope for from\nwhat the sense of touch is ordinarily expected to do.\n    And so with the sense of taste. What knows this Cain-like\nwanderer from God and God's people, of the absolute sweetness\nof the Divine nature? He can no more appreciate the\nlofty significance of the word: \"O taste and see that the Lord\nis good,\" than can the furred tongue taste the delicacies of\nhigh living. In so far then as his recovery is concerned, nothing\nis to be expected from this sense of taste.\n    And so of the sense of smell. The olfactories of the expelled\nfrom Eden can no more appreciate the odor of the new\nEden - its truths and its graces. Mortally affected in the\nFall, centuries of disuse have well nigh obliterated its powers.\nEntirely so, in so far as any hope of return to God is concerned.\n    With the senses of seeing, feeling, tasting, smelling all gone,\nthere remains but one living sense, the sense of hearing, upon\nwhich any hope of salvation may rest. O, glorious ear! O,\nglorious power of hearing! The Fall, with all its incipient\nevils, could not touch thee! Nor could centuries of wandering\nfrom God deaden thy powers.\n    These could nullify, aye, destroy all the rest, but not so the\near. Under the terrible load of Adam's disobedience, and the\n\nThe Glory of the Ear.             329\n\nequally terrible load of man's transgressions, seeing, feeling,\nsmelling, tasting all gave way, and fell into irrecoverable ruin.\nBut thou, O, Ear, emblem of mercy, channel of love, thou wast\nsuperior to them all. Fairer than all thy brethren, thou wast\nthe desired one.\n    We could wish that each of you would inform himself as\nto the teaching of Scripture, in regard to the ear and the power\nof hearing. Law-giver and chronicler, prophet and apostle,\nweary not in reference to it and the mighty part it plays in\nMan's redemption. Are priests to be consecrated? The command\nis: \"Thou shalt kill the ram and take of his blood, and\nput it upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and upon the tip\nof the right ear of his sons,\" etc. Is the very principle of all\nsalvation to be stated? The word is: \"Faith comes by hearing.\"\n(Rom. 10:17.)\n    In short, as we dwell upon the ear and the faculty of hearing,\nnothing less than a surprise is in store for him who will\nconsult such an authority as Strong's \"Exhaustive Concordance\nof the Bible.\" A quarto of the largest size, yet are not\nless than eight pages occupied by what is said of the ear and\nof hearing!\n    It is for such reasons as just given, that we conclude that\nthe reference to the ear by the writer of the text was not of the\nnature of an incident. No other member of the body could\ntake its place. He could not say: He that hath an eye, let him\nsee; nor He that hath feeling, let him feel; nor He that hath a\ntongue to taste, let him taste; nor He that hath olfactories to\nsmell, let him smell. No, these members, these senses, these\nfaculties being dead, are as naught in the mighty work of being\nemployed as instruments in instructing the lost soul how \nto return to God. It is on account of the wisdom herein displayed\nthat not a few of the older critics of the Bible believed in what\nwas known as the verbal inspiration of the word, meaning\nthereby the immediate communication or dictation to the\nwriters of every word written; in contradistinction to the inspiration", "237", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00747", "330          Church Review.\n\ninspiration which is called plenary. Be this as it may, this we\nmay know, that in communicating the great truths of the Bible,\nthe right word was not only always used, but always placed in\nits proper place and connection.\n    Failing to realize the absolutely regal position of the ear, the\nsecular writers already named, Seneca, Aurelius, Pope, also\nfailed to give it the precedence everywhere recognized and\ngiven in the inspired word of God.\n    The special phase of hearing required in the text, what?\n    The answer to this inquiry will constitute our second proposition.\n    II. What is the special use of the ear enjoined in the text?\n    What this is we are plainly told: \"Hear what the Spirit saith\nunto the Churches.\"\n    As preliminary to what we may directly say upon these\nwords, we remark, first, that there is such an organization as\nthe church or churches, and that God's Spirit communicates\nto it messages that it is to the interest of men to know. The\nchurch always has been, is, and always will be. Nor let any\nother organization presume to stand by its side. Living as we\ndo in times when organizations quite without number, insist\non being heard, it is well to consider the fact that as compared\nto the church, they are no more than chaff, the chaff, too, of\ngrain that has been rusted. Which of them can go back to\nEden? Which of them can rank on its roll the names of\npatriarchs, prophets and apostles? Which of them has its\nmartyrs and confessors? And of which of them can it be\nsaid: * * * \"the church which He hath purchased with\nHis own blood.\" (Acts 20:28.). The church purchased\nwith His own blood! Wonderful words, these! More wonderful\ntruth! The church purchased with His blood, and\nwatered by the blood of martyrs.\n    In the presence of such facts as these, we say: Shame on the\nman who, professing to be a churchman, does not hesitate to\ngive preference to organizations that are only of to-day, and\ngive little promise of being of to-morrow.\n\nThe Glory of the Ear.              331\n\n    \"What the Spirit saith to the churches.\" God's Spirit is\nstill vouchsafed to His church; not to reveal new truths, but to\nfortify and make brilliant old truths - truths that the busy\nworld ought to know and must know, if indeed it is to go well\nwith it.\n    \"He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit\nsaith unto the churches.\"\n    Hear what?\n    What nature says? Yes. The word of inspiration is:\n\"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness, and\nall these things shall be added unto you.\" (Matt. 6:33.)\n    Lukyn Williams says in reference to the above: \"Our Lord\ngives a distinct promise that if God's cause is made the first\naim, all the necessities of life will be provided.\" (P.C.)\n    Hear what nature says, of course; only, hear what the Spirit\nsays to the churches first. Listen to the thunder if you will.\nWatch the forked lightning. Count the stars. Be acquainted\nwith the trees and birds and flowing streams. Know the construction\nof the flower. In short, personally listen to nature;\nbut first listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.\n    Hear what science teaches? Yes. And what is the science\nto which we direct your attention, but nature speaking to other\npeople? Hear nature for yourself, but hear what nature says\nto other people. Study science - its great interpreters or masters,\nwe mean. Waste no time on books written by small men,\nwhen large men have written upon the same. Devote your\nhours to the revelations the men make who have taken nature\nby force, as the zealous are said to take heaven. They who\nhave broken into the mighty Arcana of the world - the heavens,\nthe earth, the sea. Hear science, of course, but hear, first of\nall, what the Spirit says to the churches.\n    Hear what history records? Yes. Study history, that that pertains \nto the races especially: Shemitic, Hamitic and Japhetic. On this line \nwe beg that you \"drink deep to the Pierian spring.\" Acquaint thyself \nwith the history of the White Race, to whom", "238", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00748", "332              Church Review.\n\nGod gave Europe; of the Yellow Race, to whom he gave\nAsia; of the Black, to whom He gave Africa.

Push aside the mist which\nWhite scholarship has thrown over every race, save its own-\npush it aside, and aim to give the rising generation of the race\nwith which we are identified, correct views of the past; especially\nof Mizraim and more especially still of Cush, whence we\non our African side sprang. And study not only races, but\nstudy nations, their rise, their decline, their fall; and so be\nprepared to help guide the Ship of State, as is our duty.\n\nHear what the poets imagine and sign? Yes. What the\nphilosophers teach? Yes. What travellers describe? Yes.\nIn short, hear what the myriad voices of knowledge on all sides\nhave to say; but in the words of the wise Solomon: * * *\n\"With all thy getting, get understanding.\" Get a knowledge\nof nature, of the sciences, of history, and of poetry; but above\nall get an understanding of what the Spirit says to the churches.\n\n\"He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit\nsaith unto the churches.\"\n\nThis command to hear the church was no new order, for\nChrist Himself had personally declared the same: * * *\n\"If he refuses to hear the church,\" said the blessed Master,\n\"let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican.\"\n(Matt. 18:17.)\n\nCommenting upon these words, J. A. Macdonald says: \"The\nsanctuary of God is the assembly of his saints. That presence\nis here promised in relation to discipline. God is with His\nchurch to quicken prayer, to answer petition, to guide in\ncounsel.\"\n\nWe have spoken thus for the reason that among us as a\npeople respect for the church is at an exceedingly low ebb.\nInstead of the church being the ecclesia of God, it is too largely\nthe ecclesia of men. Instead of repairing hither to meet and\n\nThe Glory of the Ear.                  333\n\ncommune with Him, we repair hither to meet and commune\nwith one another. The Lord, too often, is not in all our\nthoughts, but the world and the things thereof are.\n\nWho appreciates now, among us, the force of the words:\n\"The Lord is in His holy temple; let all the earth keep silence\n before Him.\" (Hab. 2:20.) From these words, says Master\nDeane (W.J.), learn: \"That the highest glory in the universe\nis God's presence in it. That man's truest hope springs from\nthe vicinity of God. That the finest worship may at times be\ninaudible. That God oftenest speaks to those who are waiting\nto hear Him.\"\n\nKnow that the church is God's light-house. Let the light\ntherefrom be quenched, and the world is left in hopeless darkness.\nHopeless we say; for no more can the body see without\nthe eye, than can the world without the church.\n\nSadly enough, we must all confess that its light is already\nsufficiently darkened. By reason of ignorance both in the\nministry and in the people from whom the ministry is drawn,\nthe colored churches of the country are sufficiently gloomy.\nBut let not this fact, as is too often the case, be an excuse for\nwhatever of disrespect you may have. All the more should it\nbe a reason for you to rally to its support. Do not even the\npassengers come to the rescue of the ship in danger? And\nwherefore? They are not slow to appreciate the fact that not\nalone are the sailors in danger but themselves as well. So\nhere. Let the light of the church be put out, and you and the\nwhole race walk in darkness. Come, then, we say, to the help\nof the church. See to it that it has oil in the lamp. See to it\nthat its wick be trimmed. See to it that its chimney be washed\nand clean. And all the while remember the word of the Lord:\n\n\"Curse ye Meroz, said the Angel of the Lord.

I considered that acceptance by the Nineteenth \nCentury sufficient proof that my article came up to the required literary\nstandard, to say the least.\n\nI had still another striking proof of the same fact. Having learned from\nan experience which occurred during an address that I delivered before the\nBaptist Women's Home Missionary Society in Beverly Massachusetts that even\nwell-educated people who kept abreast of the times knew nothing whatever\nor very little about the Convict Lease System, I decided to write an article\non the Subject. Accordingly, I went to the Congressional Library and\nspent six weeks looking over old files of the Atlanta Constitution and other\nnewspapers published in the South. I knew that a few years previously the\nGovernor of Georgia had been so shocked by some of the revelations which\nreached his ears about the barbarity of the Convict Lease System in his\nState that he decided to probe it to its depths. [Accordingly work to the\nCongressionable Library and sepnt six years looking over old files of the Atalanta\nConstitution]  This he did and the testimony\nof eye witnesses to the murder and the unspeakable cruelties practiced\nupon the helpless prisoners, most of whom were Negroes, was published in the\nthe Atlanta Constitution.\nHaving armed myself with the facts gleaned practically first hand I\nwrote my article, making it as readable and as interesting as I could. I was\nvery careful not \"to tear passion to tatters\" and I made it a point to state\nnothing which could not be proved by what a southern white man had either\nspoken or written. Then I sent my manuscript to [nearly] practically every magazine in this\ncountry which would be likely to publish such an article. It was rejected by\never single one. Remembering that Mr. Munro had advised me to send an article\nrejected by the North American Review to the Nineteenth Century and After I\nresolved to follow his counsel in this case and I did so. A few months afterward,\nwhile I was talking to my brother in New York one day he said \"Sis,\nsomebody else has that old Convict Lease System bee in his nonnet as well as\nyourself.\" In explaining this remark he said that in several New York dailies\nhe had recently seen excerpts from an article on the Convict Lease System\nwhich had appeared in some English magazine. My heart beat fast. I wondered\n\n\n76\n\nwhether they been taken from mine. Without telling my brother that I\nhad submitted a manuscript to an English publication I rushed to the City\nLibrary as fast as I could to see whether the one I had sent had been accepted.\nSure enough. There it was in the Nineteenth Century and After exactly\nas it was written. I realized then more clearly than ever before that\nthe reason my manuscripts had been rejected by American magazines was because\nthe editors did not want the American public to know certain conditions\nwhich existed in the United States. I was thoroughly convinced that\nit would be difficult for me to write an article on the Race Problem which\nwould be accepted by any publication in this country. I became thoroughly\ndiscouraged and I did not try again to induce an editor in the United\nStates to accept an article on the Race Problem for many years.\nMy article on \"How? Why, When and Where Black Becomes \"White\" was accepted\nby the Sunday editor of the Chicago Tribune and was kept in the Office\nfor a whole year before it was released. When I wrote to the editor requesting\nhim to return it to me and stating that I intended to send it to\nanother paper, he asked Mr. Raymond Patterson who was for many years, the\nTribune's Washington correspondent to tell me that he intended to publish\n[*eventually*] it soon, because it was one of the most striking articles he had read for a\nlong time. He would have to wait a bit, however, he said, till the psychological\nmoment had arrived, because the paper had a large southern clientelle\nwhich he did not want to offend. The Boston Herald accepted and\nreleased the article as soon as the editor received it and the Chicago\nTribune also finally decided to let it appear.\nJust one more incident to illustrate the attitude toward presenting\nfacts favorable to colored people which was assumed a few years ago by\nsome of the magazines.

He had intended to force me into the little\ncubby hole set aside for colored people.\nI had another taste of the Jim Crow arrangement, when I was about sixteen\nyears old and was coming from Oberlin College to spend my vacation in\nMemphis. I had t change cars in Bowling Green, Kentucky and when I had descened\nfrom the train I asked a porter who was standing on the platform which car \nI should take for Memphis. As soon as I entered the one to which he had directed\n me, I observed that it was different from any coach which I had ever seen.\nIt was a regular day coach divided into two parts- the front being used as a \nsmoker for white men as well as colored and the rear half serving as a coach\nfor colored women and men who did not smoke.\nInstantly I knew that this was the Jim Crow coach about which I had heard\nbut had never seen. I realized that I had been trapped, and I resolved I would\nwould not remain in it, I tried to leave it and go into the car ahead of me,\nbut the conductor barred the way. When he came through the Jim Crow car to \ncollect the tickets, I told him that I did not want to remain in the coach to which\nthe porter had directed me, and that I wished he would give me a seat in the \ncoach ahead. The conductor sternly informed me that I was in the coach in whch\nwhich I belonged. \"But I have a first class ticket,\" I protested, and this is \nnot a first class coach\"\n\"This is first class enough for you,\" he replied sarcastically. \"and yu\nyou stay where you are.,\" with a look calculated to freeze the very marrow of \nmy bones. I tried hard to compose myself and decide to remain where I was. I\nkept telling myself that changing cars was not worth the fight for it I'd undoubtedly\nhave to make.\n\nI had entered the Jim Crow car in the afternoon, and it was well-filled\nfor [several?] hours. But as the evening came on, the number of passengers\ndwindled until I was the only one left. I had to travel all night, and when\nI thought that during the whole night or even a part of it I might be in th\nthat car alone at the mercy of any man who entered it I was frightened and\nhorrified. As young as I was I had heard about awful tragedies which had over\n\n\n87.\n\novertaken colored girls who had been obliged to travel on these cars.\nI decided to ask the conductor once more to allow me to go into the\ncoach ahead. But he was obdurate. When I told him how frightened I would be\nwith nobody in the car by myself during the night or a portion of it, he as\nassured me with a significant look that he would keep me company and remain\nin there with me. \"I should much rather be left to myself, I summoned courage\nto reply, \"than to have you stay with me.\" By that time I was so agitated\nI felt that anything would be preferable-to remaining alone in that car\nwith the conductor during the night- even death itself.\nBut what could I do? All at once I made up my mind to leave the train. I\nheard the conductor announce that the next stop would be Erie, where passengers\ngoing to certain destinations would have to change cars. I would get\noff there, wire my plight to my father and await instructions from him. I \nrealized that I was taking a desperate chance. I knew that shy colored girl\nwould run a great risk of having an unpleasant experience or of falling into\ndanger of some kind by getting off at night at a strange town in the South, where she\nwas acquainted with nobody and where she might have difficulty in finding a \ndecent place to stay. But of the two evils I decided that leaving the train\nwas the less. When we reached Erie, therefore, I took my valise and started\ntoward the door, But the conductor was there before me and refused to let \nme pass.\n\"What are you going to do?\" he asked. I am getting off here,\" I replied\nand I'll wire my father that you are forcing me to ride all night in a Jim \nCrow car. He will sue the road for compelling his daughter who has a first\nclass ticket to ride in a second class car.\" \"Do you know where you are go\ngoing to stop?\" he inquired. \"Do you require all the passengers who leave\nthe train to tell you their business?\" I countered.\nWhen the conductor saw how agitated I was and how determined I was not to\nremain on the train, his manner toward me changed completely.

I'll give you my manuscript, and let you\nbrowse to your heart's content through my scrap book which contains a great\ndeal of information concerning the work colored women have actually done.\n\nShe accepted the invitation and came. True to my work I have her my\nmanuscript and helped her take notes for the article on Colored Women which\nshe said intended to write immediately. She promised me that she would\napprise me of the result. I waited in vain to hear from her. About a year\nafterward I happened to be in New York, called her up and she arranged to\nmeet me. Then she told me she had written the article on The Progress of\nColored Women and had offered it to every magazine likely to publish it and]\nthat it had been rejected by every one of them.\n\nShe also related the comments on the article made by some of the editors\nwho were frank enough to express their opinions. One of them declared that\nin the hey day of Booker T. Washington's glory his magazine had not published\na word about him. He would not think of publishing an article showing\nthe progress of colored women, because colored people on general principle\nwere \"too cocky\" as it was, he said. Thus it happened that the article on\non The Progress of Colored Women written by a well-known contributor to\nthe best magazines had never appeared.\n\nMy article on Being a Colored Woman in the United States was once read\nby reader in a first-class publishing house and he was so favorably impressed\n\n\n78\n\nwith it that without my knowledge he sent it to the editor of a leading\nmagazine, feeling certain that it would be accepted. But it was rejected \nalso. The fact that a man whose business it was to read manuscripts \nfor a large publishing house thought well enough of the article to submit\nit to one of the oldest magazines in the country was proof positive\nthat there was no glaring defect in the style and that there was no striking\nevidence of bad taste.\n\nIn returning my manuscripts editors have praised them on several occasions\nand have suggested that if I would submit something on any [other] subject\nexcept the Race Problem, there might stand a pretty good chance of being accepted\nbut they gave me distinctly to understand they drew the line on that.\nThose who advised me to write about something else evidently thought that\nall I had to do was to select any subject which might tickle the fancy of\nan editor, then proceed to produce an article thereupon. They believed I\ncould direct my thoughts and my interest to any other subject that occurred\nto me just as one turns the faucet to get water in a sink. Put my whole\nbeing was centered on the condition confronting my race and I poured\nmy very heart's blood into efforts to promote its welfare. It was impossible\nfor me to write on anything which did not concern the race.\n\nAnd the only kind of article on the Race Problem which found favor\nwith editors was one that emphasized the Colored-American's vices and defects\nor held him up to ridicule and scorn. Stories which represented him\nas being a crap-shooter, a murderer, a bum or a buffoon were considered\nfine examples of literary art and appeared in reputable magazines from\ntime to time, but those which related his struggles to accomplish something\nworth while against fearful odds were labeled inartistic and never saw the\nlight of day. Those who wrote them were accused of trying to spread propaganda which was a case of literary treason on the high seas.\n\nMore than once my articles have made friends for me among literary\npeople who have stimulated and encouraged me greatly.

You haven't much time.\" That information was a blessing\nin disguise, perhaps. I had been sitting by an open window in a common\ncoach one hot day passing through Louisiana, while the smoke and dust were\ncovering me with several coats of smudge. I must therefore have been several shades\ndarker than I usually am, so I was far from being as fair as a lily, when I\nappeared at that hotel. However, the fates seemed to be guiding or misguiding\nme in this dilemma. Without changing my dress I simply refreshed myself\na bit and went into the dining room soliloquizing \"Just As I Am without One\nPlea.\" The head waiter placed me at a table at which were seated a man and\nhis wife. By the time I reached that point I had to exercise great self control\nin order to keep my composure. \"Just bring me a simple dinner,\" Isaid\nto the waiter. \"I am so late I shall not take time to give you an order- some\nthing you like yourself.\" The fact that the man and his wife did not aris\narise immediately and leave the table was very reassuring indeed. If they\nhad entertained the slightest suspicion that a monster in the shape of a real\nlife, honest- to goodness colored woman had been placed in such close proximity\nto them at a table, they would have died the death before they would\nhave submitted to such an outrage. I have always believed that the waiter had\nhis own suspicions and doubts concerning the swarthy woman who entered the\ndining room so late that evening, although, if he did, he concealed his \"guilty\nknowledge\", perfectly.\nMy room was on the floor above the main entrance with a window which reach\n[ing from the floor] to the ceiling [which] and lead to a little veranda. After I\nhad removed my had and had began to get settled, I remembered that I had [registered]\nwritten my full name quite legibly in the register and a great fear suddenly took possession\nof me. I had been filling engagements in that part of the South for three or\nfour weeks and it was quite possible that some of the waiters in the hotel\nhad read the colored newspapers which had given rather full accounts of both\nmy career and my speeches. What if they should see my name and recognize\nwho I was! If they did and should tell the management of the hotel, what\nwould happen? What would become of me? I trembled with apprehension and fear,\nWhat a fatal mistake I had made in not registering under an assumed name.\n\n\n91\n\nI tried to allay my alarm as best I could and retired. [I could not sleep] Finally I fell asleep.\nI had been in bed about two hours, perhaps, when a loud noise at my door awo\nawoke me out of a sound slumber.\n\"Your time has come,\" was the first thought that popped into my head.\nI was sure that the clerk or the proprieto had learned that I was a colored\nwoman and had come to wreak vengeance upon me for daring to violate the traditions\nand the customs of the Southland. I did not answer and tried to plan\nwhat I should do. The second knock sounder louder than the first. When I decided\nthat I would not allow myself to be taken out of that room alive to be\nbeaten and disfigured or otherwise mistreated by an infuriated mob. It came\nto my mind with startling vividness somebody had told me that Texarkana was the first city in the\nSouth in which a colored man had been burned to death. This thought did did \nnot comfort me at all.\nI hastily resolved that I would rush to the little balcony and jump\nto the ground, If that did not kill me, I argued, it might stun me enough to\nprevent me from being so sensitive to pain as I would otherwise be. By the\ntime I planned what I would do, a third knock came. Then I mustered up \nenough strength and courage to say, \"What is is? What do you want?\"\n\"Lady,\" came a soft, ingratiating voice, \"Did you ring for a pitcher\nof ice water?\" \"No,\" I fairly shouted. \"I did not.\" I hope I shall never pass\nthrough an experience like that again. It is said that it is possible for a \nhuman being to have certain feelings only once in a life time. If the feelings\nare of a harrowing, painful variety such as I experienced at that hotel\nin Texarkana, that dispensation of Providence is a great blessing indeed.\n\nI had another experience when I was filling [some] lecture engagements in Florida\nonce which proved again how unreliable railroad schedules sometimes are\nin certain parts of the South. I was told that the train for which I bought\nmy ticket would carry me through to Miami and I would arrive that night. As\nevening approached the conductor told me that the schedule had been changed\nand that I would have to remain over night at a small place which was a winter\nresort for Northerners and take a train for Miami the next day at noon.\nI had been riding all day in the first class coach and had met some interest", "59", 95, 95, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00446", "95\n\nAt My, Request The Secretary of War Suspends Order Dismissing Colored\nSoldiers.\nOne morning the telephone rang about ten o'clock. It had just been installed\nafter we had urged the Telephone Company several months to give us service.\nIt startled me, for I did not know the workmen had finished the job,\n\n\"Is this Mary Church Terrell?\" a voice inquired. \"Yes,\" I replied. \"Well\nthis is John Milholland of New York City. The colored soldiers in Brownsville\nTexas have just been dismissed without honor and I want you to go to see Secretary\nTaft right away and urge him to suspend that order till an investigation\ncan be made.\" I could not believe my ears. \"Is this Mr. Milholland of\nNew York City?\" I inquired. \"Certainly it is,\" he replied impatiently, \"and\nI want you to go to the War Department just as soon as you can as a representative\nof the Constitutional League.\nMy throat had gone on a strike and I could scarcely speak above a whisper\nbut I decided to obey orders from so courageous and so fine a chief as John\nMilholland.\nWhen I reached the State, War and Navy Building Mr. Taft's secretary\ntold me it would utterly impossible for us to see him. The Secretary of War\nhad just returned from an inspection of the posts out West, he said, and he\nwould leave the next day for the East. A mean who was about to sail for Spain\nhad tried to see the Secretary of War on business, I was told, but he had\nbeen obliged to leave without doing so, because Mr. Taft was so busy.\n[\"What do you want to see Secretary Taft about?\"]  \"Why do you want to see the Secretary of War?\" inquired his secretary.\nI knew if I explained my mission, I would have no chance of seeing Mr. Taft\nat all. I knew also that if I did not give some reason for insisting upon\nhaving an interview with him, my chances of getting one would be equally slim.\n\"I want to say a few words to Secretary Taft about the colored soldiers\nwho have just been dismissed.\" I finally mustered up courage enough to say.\nA look which plainly showed he felt spread over the secretary's face.\nHe went to report to the Secretary of War and remained closeted with him\nquite a while.\n\n\n96\n\nFinally returned saying \"The Secretary is still too busy to see you and he\ndoubts that he can see you any time to day.\" \"I'll wait here just the same\"\nI replied. \"I have already been here several hours and I might as well\nremain here a while longer.\" Nothing but desperate illness could have induced\nme to leave that office, so long as I knew Mr. Taft was still in it.\nAbout an hour later I was told the Secretary of War was willing to see\nme. \"What do you want to say to me?\" inquired Mr. Taft, as soon as I entered\nhis office. \"I have come to see you about the colored soldiers who have been\ndismissed without honor in Brownsville, Texas,\" I said. \"What do you want me\nto do about it?\" he inquired. \"President Roosevelt has already dismissed\nthem, and he has gone to Panama. There is nothing I can do.\"\n\"All I want you to do, Mr. Secretary,\" I said, \"is to suspend the order\ndismissing the soldiers without honor, until an investigation can be made.\"\n\"Is that ALL you want me to do?\" inquired Mr. Taft with good-natured sarcasm,\nas he emphasized the word all and then smiled. \"ALL you want me to\" he continued\nin the same vain, \"is to suspend an order issued by the President of\nthe United States during his absence from the country.\"\n\"But, Mr. Secretary,\" I pleaded, \"as colored people we take great\npride in our soldiers. They have always had an unblemished record and they\nhave fought bravely in every war which this country has waged, It seems more\nthan we can bear to have three companies of our soldiers summarily dismissed\nwithout honor, at least until a thorough investigation has been made.\"\nThe smile left Mr. Taft's face. He became serious and remained silent for\nseveral minutes. When he said \"I'll see what I can do about it. I'll cable\nthe President to day.\"\nWords could not express my gratitude to the Secretary of War for even\nthat small foundation on which to build hope. When I left Mr. Taft that memorable\nSaturday afternoon November 18, 1906 I was morally certain that he would do everything\nin his power to give the colored soldiers a chance. And that, be it said to\nhis credit was exactly what he did. The next morning under the headlines -\n\"Appeal for Black Troops - Mrs. Mary Church Terrell Asks Suspension of Order.\nSecretary Taft at her Request Cables President for Authority to Stop Soldiers", "62", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00756", "348                    Church Review.\n\n    The whole population of this land increased only 21 per cent. in the\nsame time. Thus we see that the church increased 11 per cent. more\nthan the population. Those who say religious interest is dying out\nwill do well to ponder over these figures.\n\nWHY THIS IS WRITTEN.\n\n    I have been frequently asked both by members of my church and of\nothers, why I do not allow my church to have entertainments.\n    I have invariably answered, because I think we can get along without\nthem. Since the church picnic season has been on, many of the dear\nmembers and friends of my church have made almost an irresistible\nplea for a picnic. One dear brother, I am told, has gone far enough to\nsay he could make $75.00 for the church if I were not in his way. A\ndear sister said, \"All the other churches are having them, and if you\ndon't have them, your members will go to other churches that have\nthem, and they will get the money.\"\n    Still another said - \"You can't hold the young people without giving\nentertainments, so they can have their enjoyment.\"\n    A dear sister with a mournful sigh as if some one had suddenly\nfallen dead, said: \"I don't know what we will do this year; the elder\nwon't let us have our May Fair.\"\n    A dear brother minister said recently: \"You had better go in with\nme and let us have a picnic, since your people are going to them you\nmight as well have the money as any one else.\"\n    Therefore, I deem it highly expedient that I should give my objections\nto Church entertainments and why I do not allow them in my church.\n    1. My first objection is, that the church entertainment is a great\nevil. First, because the object is money-making. In the language\nof another - God has asked the church to do a great many things for\nHim, but here is one He has never required of her as an institution,\nthat of money-making. He has commanded us to visit the sick, relieve\nthe poor, remember the stranger, go to the prisoner, clothe the naked\nand preach the Gospel, but never has He asked us to make money for\nHim.\n    God tells us in His word that the love of money is the root of all evil,\nif this be true, one of the great efforts of th Holy Spirit is to convict\nmen of the evil of money-making, and to draw them from their business\nlife, and to entice their thoughts from trade and traffic.\n    Can any one with the right use of his senses, believe that God would\nrequire of us the very thing from which He is trying to save us.\n    This thing of money-getting is simply awful nowadays. In conferences,\nassociations, synods and other ecclesiastical assemblages, the\nquestion is not, How many souls saved? and What is the spiritual state\nof the church? but, How much has been collected for this and that purpose?\n\nReligious Department.                     349\n\n    We cannot keep it hid, the world sees that the church has descended\nfrom her high and lofty duty of soul-saving, to the very low and unpleasant\nposition of money-getting, and hence she has about lost her\npower to save.\n    Sinners do not respect the church as they should, and a preacher\nis simply revolting in their sight. All because they have concluded that\nthe whole thing is a money machine.\n    Let the church get her heart filled with the Holy Spirit, let her get\nthat financial look out of her eyes, and the smell of the kitchen off\nher - let her throw her arms about lost and distressed sinners, and\nyearn over them in love for their immortal souls, and sinners will be\nconverted, backsliders reclaimed, and believers sanctified.\n    In a word, let the church see to the salvation of souls, and God will\nsee to it that she has enough money. The church entertainment is a\ngreat evil.\n    Then, it has a tendency to unite the church with the world. Christ\nsaid to His disciples that if they were of the world, the world would\nlove its own. We see, then, the cause of the friendly relation existing\nbetween the church and the world. The church has become worldly\nand has introduced into her practices things that are pleasing to the\nworld.\n    Therefore, the world loves its own for this very reason; God says to\nHis people, \"Love not the world, neither the things that are in the\nworld, if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\n    \"For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes;\nand the pride of life, is not of the Father, but of the world.\n    \"And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that doeth\nthe will of God abideth forever.\"\nJno. 2: 15-17.\n\n    We read in James 4:4, \"Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the\nworld is the enemy of God.\" No honest persons will deny that the\nchurch entertainment is courting the most friendly relation with the\nworld, in order to get money. And yet the above Scriptures condemn\nand utterly forbid the whole thing.\n    How any Christian minister and church can, with open Bible, engage\nin such things is an insolvable mystery to me.\n\nTHE GOSPEL IN SONG.\n\n    In all ages music played an important part in moving the human\nemotions, and yet, perhaps, there is no art which has been so much\nabused. Like many other good and sublime agencies of this world, its\ninfluence has been perverted into pernicious channels. Like many\nother things, it is capable of being transformed into the greatest blessing\nor a great curse. When united with the Gospel of Christ music is \nat once placed in the realm of the greatest helpfulness and blessing to", "247", 85, 85, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00757", "350             Church Review.\n\nerring humanity, and it is in this connection we would speak of The\nGospel in Song.\nEvery one is more or less acquainted with the great work accomplished,\nand the fame achieved, by the sweet Gospel singers--P.

I must confess I am greatly tempted to dive deeply into the past, dig into\nhistorical facts and records, [and to] plunge recklessly and everlasting into the\nthislies and thuslies, the wherefores, therefores and the whys.

But I know you will forgive me if I just mention\na few salient facts about the birth of the National Association of\nColored Women. To begin with, it [has]can boast the distinction of having two\nmothers instead of one, like the ordinary, common garden variety of\nassociations. The older of these two mothers is the National Colored \nWomen's League, which was organized here in Washington in June, 1892.\nIts President was Mrs. [Hlen] Helen Cook, the wife of a man belonging to a\nwell-known, well to do family when I came here sixty years ago. When\nthe Colored Women's League was organized in June 1892 it planned to\npromote the welfare of our group, not only in Washington, but all over\nthe United States, It planned to be National and was incorporated on\nJanuary 11, 1894--two years after it was organized. I wish I had the\ntime to read the articles of Incorporation It is impossible to imagine\na finer statement of a club's plans, purpose[s] and methods [proposed for an Association]\nthan those outlined in these Articles of Incorporation 55 years \nago. Of [these]the eight women who signed those articles only two are living today, Dr.\nAnna J. Cooper and myself.\n            The history of the other mother of the National Association of\nColored Women is most unusual [The other mother was the National Federation of Afro-American Women]and very\ninteresting indeed. Suddenly, out of a clear sky, the president of\nthe Missouri State Press Association made a scurrilous attack upon the character\nof the colored women of the United States. He sent it to Miss Belgarnie of\nEngland, a long outstanding, outspoken, true friend of our group. Miss Belgarnie\nsent the scurrilous attack to Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin, president\nof the Woman's Era Club of Boston and requested her to publish it in\nthe Woman's Era magazine which Mrs. Ruffin started in March 1894. But Mrs.\nRuffin decided not to publish the attack in the Woman's Era magazine. [But]\nShe decided to write to the societies, clubs, circles, associations and organizations\nof colored women all over the country and invite them to attend a\nconvention in Boston in July. And as a result of this call, on the 29th of\nJuly, 1895, there was opened what is designated as the First National\nConference of Colored Women even held in the United States.

Undoubtedly much of the\npraise now accorded to the Japanese has its origin in such surprise.\nFor years the world has been told that Japan had a first-class army;\nbut the world, of course, took this to mean an army quite below the\nEuropean standard. The White Man is intelligent, but his intelligence\nis not equal to conceiving the possibility of the Dark Man excelling him\nin anything. When suddenly confronted with facts he cannot ignore\nhe is apt to lose correct perspective in his amazement, and exaggerate\ntheir importance.\n\n\"So, while cheerfully and fully admitting that the Japanese have\nperformed most creditably in China, let us overcome our surprise sufficiently\nto be able to take them at their true value. In the very beginning\nof the trouble it was discovered that the War Office at Tokio possessed\nthe only complete and correct military maps of the theatre of \nwar. This was natural, China being the next door neighbor of the\nIsland Empire. Yet, had it not been for Japan, the Allies would have\nbeen without good maps. Early in the game the superiority of the\nJapanese intelligence staff became apparent, a fact which constantly\nsent the Allied commanders to them for instruction and advice. In\nthis way they acquired an ascendancy at the joint councils which they\nretained until Peking was relieved. Not that the commanders of other\nforces openly submitted themselves to be led by the Japs. Even if you\nare conscious that the Dark Man knows more than you, it will never\ndo to admit it. The Allied generals took counsel with the Japanese\nand then pretended to have known all about it all the time. This plan\nhas been known to produce good results in other matters than war.\n\n\"Nevertheless, by the time the march to Peking had begun there was\nan uneasy feeling among the Allied forces that the Japs came pretty\nnear being the whole show. Whenever a hitch occurred, which was\noften, everybody seemed to look naturally to them. On the march to\nPeking their field telegraph alone prevented the Allied army from\nlosing communication with its base.\"\n\nWe call particular attention to these words of Mr. Millard: \"Even if\nyou are conscious that the Dark Man knows more than you, it will\nnever do to admit it. The Allied generals took counsel with the Japanese\nand then pretended to have known all about it all the time. This\nplan has been known to produce good results in other matters than war.\"\n\nSociological Department.              361\n\nHere we have exquisite sarcasm at the expense of an undoubted and\ncharacteristic fault of the White Man, who affects a superiority often\nwhich he does not feel, and refuses a meed of praise when he knows\nis due to his darker brother. But why keep up a show which deceives\nnobody?\n\nIN DEFENCE OF THE SOUTHERN NEGRO.\n\nI lived in Virginia from February, 1884, to August, 1895. My business\nwas constructing and operating railroads, and I became generally\nfamiliar with the different classes of men in Virginia, Western North\nCarolina, Eastern Tennessee and a little of Georgia. For nearly ten\nyears I had under my general supervision from 100 to 1500 men, and a\nbusiness connection with merchants, farmers and mechanics, and also\nemployed some 200 State convicts.\n\nMy first experience was in Eastern Virginia, from the James River\nin Surry, Sussex and Greenville counties. This was in what is called\nthe \"black belt,\" which extended over into North Carolina. Here our\nworkmen were all Negroes-that is, the common laborers. Here we\nhad from 500 to 1000 men, and they were the best workers of any class\nI ever had any experience with in all of my railroad work (I had had\nforty years of such work before I went to Virginia), and we had many\nof Mr. Stewart's North Carolina Negroes. We paid them fair wages-as\nwages were in that section-paid them promptly and honestly, and\nworked them only ten hours. We paid them in money-we had no\ncommissary-and they gave us honest work. I could pay them off\nquicker than any men I ever had. There was no haggling about time,\nand it was understood if any mistakes occurred they would be corrected\nat the office. At first the Negroes were inclined not to make\nfull time, but they soon learned that they must be steady workers or\nthey were not wanted. The stores trusted them to run monthly bills,\nand the men allowed us to deduct this item from their pay. No percentage\nwas charged for collection, and if the men were not fairly\ntreated we would not collect the bills. I have often paid off alone,\nhaving one of the blacks carry my specie bag to the next gang, and I\nfelt as safe as I do here in Vermont. Further in the next village where\nmy office was there was no complaints of thieving. I have slept many\na night with doors open which could be entered from the street up one\nflight of stairs. Does this indicate that the Negro is \"brutal?\" I admit\nthere are bad Negroes and brutal Negroes; so there are both in the\nwhite race, North and South, and in every section of the globe that I\nhave any knowledge of.\n\nThe terminal of our railroad on the James River was only nine miles\nfrom Jamestown where the first English whites settled.

Protests were received\nfrom every part of the country against the injustice of punishing innocent men and\nsoldiers with splendid records for the misdeed of a few, when no misdeeds\nhad been proved against the few. Many army officers who dared not express an\nopinions openly for fear of being court-martialed did not hesitate to\nsay in private conversation that President Roosevelt's impetuosity had\ncaused him to make a serious blunder.\n\nThe tragedy which overtook the colored soldiers affected nobody more\nthan Brigadier General A. S. Burt who had retired. He had commanded the colored\nsoldiers in the Philippines and never grew weary of recounting their\nmarvellous deeds of valor. I was presented to him one day in the office of\nRaymond Peterson, who was special Washington correspondent of the Chicago\nTribune and one of the General's best friends. There was one story about\nhis soldiers which the General enjoyed relating more than anything else.\nWhen he was taking them to Spain during the Spanish-American War he was\nasked several times by Southerners who came to the stations to see them as\nthey passed through the towns en route to Cuba whether those \"niggers\" would really\nfight. When he told what he replied, the old General's face would flush a\nbright red and he would jump quickly from his chair like a sixteen year\nold. \"Will all our Colored men fight?\" you ask. \"Fight? did you say? Why\nthey would charge into hell, fight their way out and drag the devil out by\nhis tail.\" The General was so afraid I might forget his exact words that\nhe took the pairs to write them out on his card in his own hand, and that\ncard is lying on my desk to day.\n\n\n99 1/2\n\nGeneral Burt declared that the colored soldiers were the first to fight\nboth in the Philippines and in Cuba. They could not be surpassed, he declared\nand they had few equals.\n\nIn discussing the subject punishment inflicted by President Roosevelt\nupon the colored soldiers, people talked about the evidently unconstitutional\npart of the sentence of dismissal which carried with it the prohibition\nof right to hold civil office under the United States, which meant\nthat none of the soldiers could become messengers, letter carriers or hold\nany office under the federal government, in spite of the fact that civil\nservice rules give an honorably-discharged soldier many preferences\nover civilians.\n\nPresident Roosevelt made the wholesale discharge of three companies of\ncolored men, privates and non-commissioned officers, some of whom had served\nthe United States for more than a quarter of a century and were nearly eligible\nfor retirement, absolutely without consulting the Secretary of War who\nis charged with personal supervision of the army. At the time this was done\nSecretary Taft was in the West engaged in the campaign. The order was issued\nin his absence without waiting for his return, although the soldiers had been\nremoved to Fort Reno and there was plenty of time for further investigation\ninto their conduct, if such a thing were necessary. President Roosevelt probably\nconsulted Assistant Secretary Oliver, who was in charge of the war department\nduring Secretary Taft's absence.

Washington and to discredit\nhim. [It was generally known that] President Roosevelt admired the founder of\nTuskegee very much and it was generally known that Mr. Washington used the influence\nhe possessed at the White House to have the President appoint my husband\nto the judgeship. Both my husband and myself were very grateful to him\nfor the service which he rendered in this respect. But, it goes without saying\nthat Mr. Washington's influence alone would not have been sufficiently strong\nto secure the judgeship for Mr. Terrell. If the leading citizens at the National\nCapital had not wanted my husband to occupy that position, he would never\nhave been appointed by the President. Nevertheless, Judge Terrell enjoyed nothing\nmore than expressing his gratitude to Mr. Washington both publicly and privately\nfor the efforts he had exerted in his behalf.\n\nWhen I joined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored\nPeople my [husband] husband's friends warned him that this action on the part\nof his wife would alienate Mr. Washington from him and would finally bring\nabout his ruin. But Judge Terrell answered that with the statement that nobody\nbut Mr. Washington's most bitter enemy would declare that an organization\nworking to secure for the Colored-American all the rights to which he is entitled\nwas formed to oppose and discredit him. The people who took it for granted\nthat Mr. Washington was antagonistic to the principles enunciated by the National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, said my husband, evidently\nbelieved he was in favor of having the rights, privileges and opportunities\nwhich other citizens enjoy withheld from his own heavily-handicapped\ngroup. To [charge] accuse Mr. Washington with assuming such a reprehensible attitude\ntoward his race, said Judge Terrell, is one of the most serious charges which\ncould be preferred against him. And when the knowing ones continued to shake their heads in\nwarning, my husband said if he had to lose his position because his wife lived\nup to the light she had and joined an organization which she believed would\npromote the welfare of the race, he was perfectly willing to lose it.\n\n\nA Sally into Spiritualism.             119\n\nThe first time I became interested in Spiritualism one of my firends asked\nme to go with her to a medium about whom she had heard wonderful things,\nafter she had lost a beautiful cape during the inauguration festivities in\nWashington. If this woman were as remarkable as people claimed she was, said\nmy friend, she might be able to locate her cape. In the spirit of fun, rather\nthan because we expected to get the desired information, we sallied forth to\n[this? lark [?]] medium one day. My friend went into the \"Presence\" first\nand then I took my turn.\n\n\"Your name is Mary,\" said the medium as soon as she saw me. \"And there are\nare three little spirits flying around your head. Look over there\" she continued\npointing to my right, \"There is a spirit near you who is angry with\nyou. He committed suicide on account of something you did to him. Then\nthere is another spirit near you - She is a member of your family and her\nname is Emmaline.\"\n\nRight there I stopped her, stating positively that no member of my family\nhad ever borne that name. But the medium paid no attention whatever to\nthis contradiction of her statement. She insisted that the spirit she saw\nnear me was a relative and that her name was Emmaline. Perhaps I had never\nmet her in the flesh, she explained, but there she stood just the same.\n\nWhen the medium stated as soon as I entered the room that she saw\nthree little spirits flying around my head, I remembered, of course, that I\nhad lost three babies practically at birth in five years. When she referred\nto the spirit who was angry with me and had committed suicide on my account\nI laughed at her and assured her that nothing like that had ever occurred in\nmy life. But she insisted that she knew what she was talking about and my\ndenials did not move her one inch.

The milkman takes his animals with him, jangling\ntheir bells and sneezing. \"Gala!\" he shouts, a quick, startling cry with\na \"g\" whose guttural quality is unattainable by adult learners and\nusually unperceived by them. When a customer comes to the door he\nstrips the desired quantity into the proffered receptacle before her\nvigilant eyes, selecting one of the goats, and paying no attention to the\nothers, who understand the business as well as he does.

When\ntheir master moves on, they arise and follow, more faithful than dogs.\nThe obvious and well-nigh overpowering temptation to which the milkman\nis subjected, affects him in Greece as in America.

I rushed to my stopping\nplace, began to dress at 7:35, ate dinner, repacked my dress suit case before \nleaving the house, went to the church, delivered my speech, was on the\nboat again at 9:45, reached New York about 7 the next morning, went to the\noffice to get my mail, and left for Dover,Delaware at 11 and arrived there at\n4;22.\n\nThis work appealed to me strongly. It was literally\"the way I long\nhad sought and sighed because I found it not.\" There was a new experience a\neach place. Although I had been on the lecture bureau, the situations and\nthe thrills in a political campaign seemed entirely different. The audience\nwere very responsive and enjoyed expressing their satisfaction and approbation. \nBut there is no rose without a thorn.\n\nAnd right here I must relate the only unpleasant experience I have\never had during a political campaign. Less than five minutes after I reached \nDover, Delaware, I was threatened arrest by the ticket agent there.\nThe gentleman who was to meet me at the station did not appear, so I went\ninto the telephone book to phone him. Unfortunately, I looked into the Wilmington \nDirectory in the front part of the book , thinking it was for Dover\nand did not turn to the back part where the Dover numbers were.\n\nSince there was no Bureau of Information in the little station, I\nwent to the window of the ticket office and saw a young man standing there\nreading a magazine. Dover is not a large city and the man whom I wished to \nreach was well known there, both because he was a first class paper hanger\nand because he had been actively engaged in politics for years. \"I am a \nstranger here,\" I began,\"and I am trying to reach Mr. Ross, whom I expected \nto meet me. I can not find his name in the telephone directory? Have\nyou any idea how I could reach him?\"\n\nA man sitting in the ticket office behind the younger man addressed\ngrowled roughly \"Go look in the telephone directory.\" \"I have already\nlooked in the directory before coming here, and I can not find his name,\nI replied.\n\n\n150\n\n\" Go away from that window,\" the man stormed at me,\"and dont bother me\nany more.\" Thinking the ticket agent was provoked because he thought I had\ncome to him for information before I sought it at the proper source, I tried\nto placate him by saying \"I did not come to you till I had looked into the\ntelephone directory.\" \"Go away from that window,\" the man roared again,\"or\nI'll have you arrested. I'll call the police.\" \"For what?\" I asked.\n\nThen he rushed angrily to the telephone, took down the receiver and\nbegan to talk. Naturally I thought he was carrying out his threat. Feeling\nsure that the police would soon come to arrest me, I decided to ask information \nfor the number I could not find in the telephone directory. While I\nwas phoning I glanced up and saw the ticket agent standing at the door listening \nto what I was saying. At first I thought he had come to strike me, he\nwas in such a towering rage, but when he did not approach me, I decided he\nhad left the ticket office and had come to the telephone to prevent me from\nthe leaving the stating till the policy arrived.\n\nI then decided he should not have the pleasure of forcibly detaining\nme so I resolved to remain in the station till the police arrived. Every\ntime the station door opened after that, I expected to see an officer of the\nlaw coming to arrest me. After waiting about fifteen minutes I inquired how\nmuch longer I would have to remain there, before the police came to take me.\n\n\"Take your seat,\" the ticket agent roared, shaking his first at me.\n\n\"I am a busy woman,\" I replied,\"and it is not right to keep me waiting\nhere so long for arrest.\" Then the agent jumped from his chair, rushed to\nthe telephone again and jerked the handle so viciously I thought he would\nbreak it. He phoned for the police a second time. I waited patiently for\nwhat seemed to me a long time, expecting every minute to have an officer\nopen the station door and arrest me.\n\nFinally I went to the ticket window and said \"I will not wait\nhere any longer to be arrested. I shall leave this station.\" \"Go away from\nthat window,\" shouted the agent. Take your seat. You are disorderly. You\nknow you are.\" \"No I am not disorderly,\" I replied. \"I had no idea I would\noffend you by asking you a civil question.\"", "90", 95, 95, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00473", "147\n\nAfter I knew anything about the manner in which the Government was run, I\ncannot remember the time that I did not believe women should be allowed to\nhave a voice in the management of its affairs. I had believed in and advocated\nwoman suffrage all my life and I was happy at the prospect of being able \nto practice what I had preached. This I could not do literally, however, for\nin the District of Columbia where I had lived thirty years, everybody was disfranchised,\nmen and women, black and white, old and young, crazy and sane \nalike. At least there was no discrimination against anybody in the National\nCapital on account of race, sex, class or condition.\n\nWhen I arrived at the National Republican Headquarters in New York\nno place could be found for the office of the woman who had been appointed\nDirector of the Eastern Division. Up and down I went through the big building\npeering into every nook and corner, into every crack and crevice, only to be\ntold that every room had been preemptied - everything had been assigned to\nsomebody else. At last I found an open space for my headquarters on the 3rd\nfloor which had no provacy whatever. But there were a few square feet, at\nleast, which I could call my own with which I could begin to function.\n\nFirst, I had interviews with many colored women who had been engaged\nin the political activities of the city, some of whom being captains in\ntheir respective districts. Each and every one of them [pledged me his cooperation]promised to cooperate\nwith me, which encouraged and gratified me greatly, for I had heard that efforts\nhad been made to prejudice the Eastern women against me, both because I had no\nvote myself and because I was said originally to have hailed from the South.\nAmong a few disgruntled souls, I was informed, an effort was made to create\nsentiment against me on the ground that it was a reflection upon them to\nsend a woman to teach them how to vote. But I had been in the office only a\nshort time before [I had the undivided support of] all the women active in\npolitics gave me their undivided support.\n\nThen I tried to effect an organization by appointing women to take\ncharge of the political work in their respective States. The following is\none of the first letters sent out: Republican National Committee - New York\n\n\n148\n\nCity - Room 21, October 13, 1920. Dear Friend: I have been designated by the\nRepublican National Committee to take charge of the activities among colored\nwomen in the Eastern States. We want to reach each and every woman in your\nState, so that she will register and vote for Warren G. Harding as President\nand Calvin Coolidge as Vice President. We have very little time to do a\ngreat deal of work which must be done. Although we feel perfectly sure that\nthere will be victory for the Republican Party on November 2nd, we must neither\nsleep at the switch nor rest on our oars. Let us work as though we fear\nwe shall lose and then we shall be sure to win.\n\nPlease urge every woman with whom you come in contact to do her duty\nat the polls. By a miracle the 19th amendment has been ratified. Colored women\nall over the country now have a weapon of defense which they have never\npossessed before. It will be a shame and reproach to us, if we do not use it.\nHowever much the white women of the country need suffrage, for many reasons\nwhich will immediately occur to you, colored women need it more.\n\nIf you do not use the franchise, we shall give our enemies a stick\nwith which to break our heads and we shall not be able to live down the reproach\nof our indifference for one hundred years. I am sure you will do your\nduty. I believe you are as eager to discharge the duties and obligations of\ncitizenship as I am. Hold meetings. Talk about going to the polls to vote\nwith every woman you meet.\n\nPlease let me hear from you immediately.

Just as soon as I left the train, a little woman approached me and said -\"Well, Mrs. Terrell,\" said she, \"I have come to take you to address the pupils of Normal School here.  We shall have to hurry a bit, for they will assemble about one o'clock.\nI was speechless with surprise and a kind of stage fright took possession of me.  I told I told the principal that as much as I should like to comply with her request, it was impossible for me to do so, because I was tired from travel-ling and speaking, had to fill an engagement in Milwaukee that night and felt that duty both to my audience and to myself demanded that I go to my stopping place and rest til it was time to deliver my address.\nI explained also that I was not accustomed to addressing audience com-posed exclusively of young people and feared that I could not do it well, But she was a typical western woman, both determined and breezy and would not take No for an answer.  \"The very idea of your telling me you can not ad-dress my pupils,\" she complained, when they have all been assembled from dif-ferent sections of the city and are expecting you to talk to them.\"  I should like to refresh myself a bit and change my dress,\" I suggested completely subdued, but she told me very positively that there was not time enough for that and I looked well enough.\nThen and there I surrendered.   There was nothing else for me to do with that personification of determination.  \"If you will be kind enough not to talk to me,\" I said meekly, \"I'll try to think what I had better say on the Race Problem to a group of young white people who know very little about it, I presume, while we are on the street car going to the building.\"\nIt occurred to me as I rode along to this engagement which I dreaded more than any I had ever filled before, that the best thing for e to do could be to related briefly the progress which colored men and women had made, particularly the women- then appeal to their sense of justice.  As I concluded my talk to about 400 of these Normal School pupils, I told them I was not asking them to embrace colored people every time they saw one.\n35\n\"You may have an insuperable aversion to people whose skins are dark.  If that is true,\" I declared, \"I do not blame you at all.  I pity you.  It is your misfortune, not your fault, to dislike any human being whom our Creator has made, simply because his complexion is darker than yours.  Put even tho you may dislike to be near an individual, you can be just to him and treat him like a human being, and give him a chance.  Let me impress this fact upon you.  There are thousands of colored boys and girls whose minds are as good as yours and whose aspirations are just as high, but have to knock their heads against a brick wall of prejudice every time they try to secure certain positions from which they are barred solely on account of their race and color, although they are fitted by native ability and training to fill them just as well as you can.  I want to implore you to decide her an now that when you grow to be men and women you will throw the weight of your influence on the side of justice, opportunity of all kinds and fair play in behalf of your brothers and sisters of a darker hue.\nNever in my life did I make a talk which was more likely to bear good fruit than that if the impressions upon the minds and hearts of my auditors are to measure its worth.   I received several letters from the students of that Normal School, saying that they had never before thought about the difficulties confronting colored boys and girls in their effort to earn a living and to find a place for themselves in the United States, but that they pledged themselves to do everything in their power to remove those disabilities and improve conditions for them, when they grow to manhood and womanhood.   It surprised and delighted me to discover that I could interest white youth in the Race Problem, and thereafter I accepted every invitation to address pupils in the Public Schools or students in colleges and universities which I could.'\nI was invited to deliver the Thursday lecture at Oberlin College, my alma mater.

That described the Maryland\nPeace Committee with Mr. Malik as taking place in a warm, friendly atmosphere.\nThey said the meeting expressed the desire for peace whoch the great\nmass of American people want very much. If the Maryland Peace Committee\nhad done nothing else but impress the Russian people with the fact that the\nAmerican people want peace, their efforts would have been well worth while.\nfor those who are in a position to know the facts say the Russian people are\nbeing continually told that the people in the United States love to fight\nabove everything else and are trying to provoke Russia to way. The Russian\npress published the questions which Mr. Malik was asked and said they were\nasked in the name of the city of Baltimore and of Maryland, the State. It is\nimpossible to overestimate the good which may be done by giving the Russian\npeople behind the iron curtain this information about the people in the United\nStates. and their desire for peace. It is impossible to overestimate the good\nwhich may be done by telling the Russian people as Mr. Werthheimer has done through the \nstatement presented to Malik that the strengthening of friendship between the peoples\nof the Soviet Union and the United States, not only is the burning wish\nof the people of Maryland but of all the American people. With all my heart\nI congratulate the President, the Committee which met Mr. Malik and the \nmembers of the Maryland Committee for peace. Let the good work go on.\nGenerally speaking there is no doubt that practically the whole\nworld hopes for a durable peace. The world is tired of dangers and war-like\ntensions which have held it in their terrible grip for at least four of\nfive years. Under prevailing conditions, with human nature as it is, if \nanyone should ask you if you think it is possible to have peace in the\nworld, what would you say? In replying to the question it would be necessary\nfor you to remember of course that there are  many races of human beings\nin the world who differ in complexions, apparently in native ability\nin disposition, some of whom are strong and some of them weak. The world\ncalls some of the races superior and some inferior. The strongest and richest\nof what are considered [called] the superior races have developed a system called \n\"Colonialism\"\n\n4\n\"Colonialism\", by which they hold in subjection the weaker groups, from whom\nthey take their land, often full of valuable products of one kind or another,\nsometimes silver, gold and diamonds, and grow richer day by day, while\nmany of the natives  live in want and some of them nearly starve. Sometimes these\nsuperior races invade the countries of the weaker races under the pretext\nof \"civilizing them\", occasionally they stir up a war with the natives\nwhich with powerful weapons they win, because the natives know nothing\nabout civilized warfare and have only crude weapons with which to fight.\nIt is unnecessary for me to consume your time giving a list of such\ncases, for they are well known. For 100 years India was held by Great Britain\nwhich kept the natives in subjection and cold-bloodedly appropriated the most \nvaluable products the country possessed. In addition to having the major portion of\ntheir wealth stolen from them, while England grew richer and richer year\nby year, many of the natives lived in wretched squalorand a number of them\nstarved, and some of them  were subjected to indignities of various kinds\nand were often the victims of injustice and cruelty beyond belief. They were\ngiven to understand they belonged to an inferior race and should not consider\nthemselves the social equals of the British.\nColonization has made Holland one of the richest countries in the \nworld. From time immemorial she has been appropriating to herself valuable\nproducts from the natives to whom they rightfully belonged.

But the medium paid no attention whatever to\nthis contradiction of her statement, she insisted that the spirit she saw near\nme was a relative and that her name was Emmaline. Perhaps I had never met her\nin the flesh, she explained, but there she stood just the same.\n\nWhen the medium told me as I entered the room that she saw three little spirits flying around my\nhead, [as I entered the room,] I remembered, of course, that I had lost three\nbabies practically at birth in five years.

I remained\nin that school for a year, then attended the public schools of the town about\n3 years, was taken to Oberlin, Ohio, entered the 8th grade of the public\nschools there and graduated from the High Schhol in June 1879, I attended the\nSenior Class of the preparatory department of Oberlin College which has\nsince been abolished [abandoned], [and] received my AB degree from Oberlin College in 1884\nand my AM degree in 1887.  In 1946, Wilberforce University [conferred the] awarded\nme the degree of Doctor of Letters, Howard University and Oberlin College conferred\nthe degree of Doctor of Humane Letters upon me in 1948. \n\n(3) I understand that after leaving school your chief interest was in the\nfield of education. Would you tell us something about that?\n\nAfter graduating from Oberlin College I remained a year with my\nfather in Memphis. I wanted very much to teach, but my father was bitterly\nopposed to my teaching. He said he was able to support me, to give me every\nthing I needed and wanted very much to do it. Moreover, he said he thought it\nwould be a sin for me who didn't need it to get a job as a teacher and\nthus deprive a girl of a job who needed it to support herself. I went to New\nYork to see my mother in the summer and while there I definitely decided to\nteach. I wanted very much to come into direct contact with our youth, especially\nour young women. I felt it was my duty to do so. So I wrote to several\nof our colleges and offered my services as a teacher. 65 years ago very\nfew colored girls had graduated from a college of Oberlin's standing, so that\nI was offered a position in practically every college to which I wrote. I accepted\nthe position offered me by Wilberforce University because I was impressed\nwith its history and knew that the great Bishop Payne was there. Moreover,\nI knew my father would object less to my teaching in the North than in the\nSouth, and I wanted to placate and please him if I possibly could.\n\n     Shortly after beginning my work at Wilberforce I wrote my father explaining\nthe reasons why I thought it was my duty to teach and entreating\nhim to forgive me for disobeying and displeasing him, assuring him that I had\nonly done so because I thought it was my duty to the young people of my race.\nHis angry reply grieved me sorely. I finished that year at Wilberforce and\nenjoyed my work very much. I decided to spend\nthe summer vacation with my mother in New York. About the last of July I suddenly\ndecided to go to see my father. Mother did not object, so I took the\ntrain for Memphis. The day before I arrived I sent father a telegram saying\n\"Arrive tomorrow morning at five o' clock. Daughter.\" The next morning when\nthe train pulled into Memphis there was my handsome, well-beloved father\nat the station waiting for me! He became thoroughly reconciled to my teaching,\nwas willing for me to return to Wilberforce the next year and then to\naccept a position in the High School here.\n\n                                         2\n(4) Would you like to tell us about some of your trips to Europe and\nsome of your interesting experiences while there?\n          After teaching in Washington a year my father consented to let me study\nin Europe. We took a three months trip together in Europe, and then he very\nreluctantly left me in Paris. When he took the train to go to the steamer\nfor home he begged me to go with him. I told him I couldn't because my\nclothes were at the hotel. \"Leave them,\" he said, \"I'll get you some more clothes when\nwe get home.\" But there was no [not any] chains strong enough anywhere in the world to drag me from\nParis that day! I studied French in Paris for a short time, but at that period\nit was considered necessary for a respectable girl to have a chaperone\nand not to walk on the streets unattended. Not being accustomed to such restrictions\nI decided to go to Lausanne, Switzerland, where I would have the freedom\nwhich the young women of my own country enjoyed.\n     I staid in Lausanne a year and was very fortunate in finding a home with a fine family in [who] which\nthere were two daughters about my age, who made my stay in that picturesque, lovely city\ndelightful and distinctly worth while from every point of view. I had a small\nroom with one window from which I could see both the towering Alps and the\nlow-lying Jura mountains. I attended a school for girls and enjoyed my work\nvery much,. From Lausanne I went to Berlin, Germany, and was fortunate\nagain in finding an ideal home with the widow of a Court minister who had\ntwo daughters near my age who took me everywhere they went. After studyi ng\nin Berlin nearly a year I went to Florence Italy where I remained about \nsix months.\n     I had many interesting experiences in Europe which I wish I could relate. On that trip perhaps\nthe most interesting and significant one was in Berlin while I was living\nwith Frau Oberprediger Hoche. Her daughters took me to a party one afternoon.\nGirls from every country in Europe were there and they began to talk\nabout the different governments under which they lived.

Pisces is ruled by Neptune.\n\n\n\nGOOD TASTE IN CLOTHES\n\nIt is axiomatic that fashions are for those they fit.  While keeping up to \ndate is one of the essentials of good taste, yet an amazing number of women will \naccept and wear a new fashion even when it brings out their worst features, \nmerely because everybody else is doing it.  A little study of individual needs \nwill prevent making such a mistake, for the rules for being well-turned-out \nare dictated by good taste.  Good taste is essentially appropriate.  If, for example, \na girl of eighteen, piquant and vivacious in the bloom of youth, should \naffect soft, black, clinging materials of sophisticated cut, the result would \nbe in poor taste.\nYour physical features should determine your most becoming mode of \ndress.  Details that are not altogether pleasing must be softened so that they \nare not noticed; good points brought out cleverly to focus attention on them, \nin the manner of the man who wore a very conspicuous necktie to conceal \nthe fact that his shoes were shabby.  If your shoulders are too broad, avoid \na cape effect on a dress, and employ a contrasting collar that will break the \nexpanse from neck to shoulder.  If you are not pleased with your ankles, study \nthe situation and purchase your shoes and stockings with an eye to modifying \nthe trouble.  If you consider your bust to be insufficiently developed, a soft, \nfull, draped effect in your blouse will do very well.  For too-broad hips, the \ncut and fit of the dress, with a properly placed panel will be a solution.  Perhaps \nyour neck is too thin and inclined to be scrawny, or it may be too short and \nthick.  Then see that the neck-line of your dress is cut to help matters rather \nthan to accentuate them, or let the right collar or ruff do the trick.  Do not \ntry for complete concealment of a bad feature - soften it and it will not \nattract attention.  Bring out your good points and depend on them to give the \nimpression of you that you wish to convey.\nDo not select your dresses because they appeal to you on a model or in \na fashion drawing.  Study your own problems first, and study them thoroughly.  \nKnow definitely your exact needs in design, in color and in cut, and do your\npurchasing with them firmly in mind.  Do not permit an unflattering fashion, \nno matter how popular, to influence you.  Learn that individual good taste is \nthe smartest of all fashions, and the most becoming.\nMaterials are important.

He was very indignant,\nof course. He quickly took the train for New York. When he returned, he\nbore with him a paper signed by a priest, who certified that the colored\nwoman, who reared him was not his mother, but his nurse. Unfortunately,\nhowever, there happened to live in the same city, a woman, who had been\npresent at the birth of the prosperous real estate dealer. But she did not\nmolest him, and he went on his metamorphosed way rejoicing.\nSuch instances might be multiplied almost indefinitely.\n\n\n\n6\nOn account of the Jim Crow car laws, the impossibility of securing accommodations\nat the hotels and because of other hardships, many fair colored people\nleave the South and move North, where they lose their identity completely.\nYears ago during slavery white masters who loved their colored children\ntoo dearly to enslave them introduced this fashion of making black white\nby sending them North or to Europe.

It would astound some, however, to [learn] hear that the feat is\nsometimes performed even in the South, where the whites are supposed to have\na patent on detecting the \"man and brother\", no matter how much he rivals\nthe lily in fairness. I heard a very amusing incident not long ago, which\nillustrates the ease with which this is done even in the South.\nAn exposition was in progress in a certain southern city. A man, who is\ncolored, but fair enough to be mistaken for something else/ went to visit\nhis sister. She was very enthusiastic about [a certain] an East Indian with \nan unpronounceable name, who had astounded the natives by his wonderful\nfeats of skill. The most exclusive white leaders of that very exclusive social\nset had invited him to their homes, where he had transported them with\njoy and wonder by his [skill] adroitness and marvelous powers. \"Herbert,\" said the man's sister, to whom I\nhave just referred, \"I want you to meet this East Indian so much.\nCome with me, and I'll introduce you to him.\" They wended their way to\nhis office. \"Mr. So and So,\" said the colored sister, let me introduce my brother,\nHerbert Rutledge to you.\" The eyes of the two men met. \"Hello Bert\"\nsaid the East Indian, reaching out his hand \"why we haven't seen each other for years.\"\nThis case is all the more remarkable, because the supposed East Indian, \nhad been born and brought up as colored in that very city and his relatives were\nstill living there. He visited them after dark, but he grew so bold\nabout it that his friends warned him [to stop] to exercise more caution.", "3", 99, 99, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-002:00223", "Good Taste in Clothes (cont'd)\n\ncharmingly hold to her type in appropriate clothing by wearing a knitted \nsuit of fine texture, a Cashmere sweater and plain, and good-looking shoes with \na Cuban heel all of which are quite fitting to both the type and place.\nColors are naturally dictated by individual characteristics of complexion, \nhair and eyes.  Choose your colors with as much care as you exercise in the \nselection of your cosmetics, for they will exercise a great effect on your facial \nappearance.  Bright colors will help a sallow complexion and in themselves are \na form of cosmetic.  Beware of colors that clash with skin and hair tones, for \nit is very easy to get a most unflattering effect in this way.\nHats are usually very carefully considered by most women, and yet this \npart of feminine dress is often poorly chosen.  Here again bear your own specific \nneeds in mind, and do not allow yourself to wear a hat that does not \nconform to your features, enhance your good points and soften your weak ones.  \nLet careful study and honest self-appraisal before a mirror be your only guide.\nGood taste requires good sense.  \"Know thyself\" and select accordingly.\n\nHolding on to Beauty\n\nWoman, it is said, spends most of her life in pursuit of beauty.  Whatever \nthe exact truth may be, it is certain that there are sufficient aids at her disposal \nin bottles and jars.  Yet there are many others, all too rarely considered, that \ncan be immensely beneficial.  Let's talk about them:\nFirst off, there is rest.  But how many women, going at a rapid pace all \nday, have any more rest than the usual night's sleep.  A half-hour's nap in \nmid-afternoon, or even a half-hour spent in complete relaxation in a comfortable \nchair will keep tired lines from marring a fair face.  For the business \nwoman, this should be had immediately upon arriving at home in the evening.  This is a standard formula among famous beauties and beauty specialists.\nNerves are wreckers of beauty.  One way of quieting them in their destructive \nprocesses is to fill the bath-tub with very warm water.  Simply immerse \nyourself in it, close your eyes and relax.  Nerves will give way to a luxurious \nindolence, and after twenty minutes of this steeping, a shower of much cooler \nwater will put you on your toes, refreshed and ready for anything -- except \nan attack of nerves.\n\n[196]\n\n\nHolding on to Beauty (Cont'd)\n\nThen there is fresh air.  Not that the mere contact of it on the skin is \nproductive of miraculous results, but walking briskly in the open will result \nin stirring your blood until your cheeks are pink and your eyes are glistening. \nThe walking should be accompanied by deep breathing in order to further \nthe blood stimulation.  In this way, impurities are carried off before they \ncollect to the extent of becoming a skin imperfection.  When impurities are \nnot carried off by the blood, Nature attempts to get rid of them by pushing \nthem through the skin.  If you would avoid this latter method, get your \nblood moving!  Most women massage their faces with great devotion, and thus \nstimulate the flow of blood that results in good complexion.  This however, \ndoes not help the rest of the body, and a really good complexion means \ngood all over.\nDiet is well-known to be essential in the pursuit of beauty.  We are too \nprone to be careless of it until the weight-scale point to an alarming figure.  \nBut improper diet, even when it does not produce excess weight, can easily \nresult in improper elimination and mild stomach or intestinal disorders that \nwill be reflected by the complexion, or revealed by the dullness of the eyes.\nFrequent bathing, too, with a good soap of gentle cleansing action, is \nnecessary to free the pores of impurities and to remove perspiration odors.  \nA clean skin is a healthy skin.\nFinally, there are two other thieves of beauty:  eyes and feet.  Now, while \nit may seem remote, these much-used parts have an important bearing on the \nsubject.  Eye-strain can result in many troubles, from headache to indigestion.  \nIf your eyes are in frequent use on close work, you may feel the effects in one \nform or another, and should lose no time in correcting a bad condition. Remember \nthat eye-strain makes wrinkles and indigestion is bad for the complexion, \nso you see that vanity is on both sides of the eye-glass question.\nAnd shoes:  however the fashion may have come into being, it cannot be \ndenied that the height of the heels on women's shoes throws their entire \nanatomical structure out of line.  This is frequently productive of all kinds of \nupsets.  See that you have at least a few hours respite from this every day.  \nWalking barefoot is also an excellent foot beautifier.  As to the fit of shoes -- \nthey must fit properly, or who can look lovely when feet are aching and burning.  \nAnd if a foolish vanity insists on tight or badly-fitting shoes, consider \nalso the appearance those tortured feet will present next summer on the beach!", "75", 107, 107, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-021:00202", "[1905]\nHow, When, Why and Where Black Becomes White.\n\nIt's just as easy as falling off a log. This is what our friend tells us\n when he wishes to show that very little effort is required to bring a certain\n thing to pass , But falling off a log is really a difficult feat,\n compared with the ease with which colored people in this country are \nsometimes transformed into white. At first blush it would seem that a \ncamel with a hump could literally pass through the eye of a cambric needle \neasier than an individual, tainted with even a drop of the fatal\n African tincture, could palm himself off as a bona fide white man or woman\nin the United States. And yet, colored people are doing this very\nthing in droves every year. It does not require voluminous knowledge\nnor yet great profundity to comprehend why some colored people are tempted\nto pursue such a questionable course.\nLet us take a colored man, for example, who is fairly well educated and \nis ambitious to make his way in the world. There are comparitively few\ntrades open to colored people. These are generally overcrowded, which\nmeans poor pay. Some labor organizations are not spending sleepless\nnights devising ways and means of adding negro workmen to their ranks.\nFor a long time our colored friend knocks at first one door and then\nanother, which he finds [that] can be opened only by a white man's hand.\nHe becomes discouraged. \"What a curse it is to be a negro in this \ncountry,\" he mutters. Suddenly he looks in his little mirror. He has\ndone that before, perhaps. He has always been identified with the struggling\nrace, but he has a fair skin and straight hair. Something asserts \nitself. There are those who say that it is his white blood. \"What's the \nuse of trying to row against the tide,\" he says. \"Nobody but a giant can\naccomplish the  impossible, and I am not a giant\" There is bitterness\nin his tone, as he soliloquizes, and discouragement is written on his \n face.  He quickly reaches a decision. He may have thought of it before.\n\n\n\n4\nother course to pursue\", he insisted. \"For a long time\", said he, \"the\nsalesgirls complained, because I had placed a nigger in the store. I denied\n that she was colored. They brought me innumerable proofs of the fact.\nWell, if you dont care to work in the store with Miss Jones,\", I said,\n \"you may leave. After that they told my customers about it. Delegation \nafter delegation of white women came down to protest against my employing\na 'nigger' saleswoman in my store. They threatened to boycott me, and \nmade things so hot for me that I was forced to dismiss Miss Jones in self\ndefence. Now, if my business were in New York, I should have kept her\"\nBut I thought of the fate of the colored forewoman in the New York department store.\nThe last of the three cases which came under my own observation was very\nsimilar to the first two. A young colored woman in Washington, who did\nnot show a trace of her African ancestry was made forewoman in a fashionable\ntailor establishment for ladies. Her employer discharged her also, \nwhen he  learned that the fatal drop was coursing through the veins some\nwhere. It is conceivable that no one of these colored women would have\nreceived their walking papers, if the employer had been unable to fill \ntheir places. It is difficult to find a trade, however, in which the\nworkmen are so few that a place cannot be filled. These cases will show \nwhy some colored people are tempted to pass for white.  [*Here*]\nIt is very amusing to see some of the sons and daughters of Ham after the \nmetamorphosis has become un fait accompli. To some of those who have\ngrown up with them, it is disgusting, perhaps. \"Do you see that man over \nthere\" said one of my friends with whom I happened to be on the street\ncar not long ago. \"Well, that lady sitting beside him is his wife. [Next]\n He is colored, but she is white.\" \"Are you sure he is colored?\" said I \ndoubting Thomas like. \"I ought to be\", he answered, \"he and I played together\nas children. At Grant's funeral in New York, we occupied the same\nroom in the Grand Union Hotel.

A man, who is colored, but who is fair enough to be mistaken for \nsomething else, went to see his sister. She was very enthusiastic about \nan East Indian with an unpronounceable name, who had astounded the natives \nby his wonderful feats. The most exclusive lady in the most exclusive \nwhite social circle had invited him to her home, where he transported \nthe guests with wonder and joy by his adroitness and marvellous skill. \n     \"Herbert,\" said the man's sister to whom I have just referred, \"I want \nyou to meet this clever East Indian so much. Come with me and let me introduce\nyou to him. He is at leisure just about this time.\"\n     They wended their way to his office. \"Mr. So-and-So,\" said the man's \nsister, \"let me present you my brother, Herbert Rutledge, to you.\"\n     The eyes of the two men met in instant recognition. \"Hello, Bert,\" \nsaid the great East Indian, reaching out his hand, \"why we haven't seen \neach other for years.\"\n     This case is all the more remarkable, because the East Indian had been \nborn and brought up as colored in that very southern city, and his relatives \nwere still living there. He visited them almost every night after \ndark, but he grew so bold about it that his friends warned him to exercise \nmore caution and discretion. \n     Perhaps one of the most remarkable cases in the history of American \njurisprudence was caused by this vexed race problem. A well-to-do young \nwhite man of French extraction fell desperately in love with a beautiful \nyoung colored girl in Tennessee. In spite of the threats and entreaties \nof his family and friends he married her. He was obliged to take her out \nof his own State of Arkansaw, where there was no penalty attached to the \nintermarriage of the races. When the young couple returned home a probable \nsentence to the penetentiary of seven years stared both in the face. \n     Without going into full details of this case, it was proved in a court \nof law that the young colored woman was white. She had been reared all her \n\n\n\n9\nlife by a mulatto aunt with very curly hair. She had attended a college \nexclusively for colored youth. But, as I have already said, the courts \ndecided that she was white, and white she was for many years in the \nsame city in which she was reared as a colored girl and where she could \nnot possibly walk down town without meeting some of the colored friends\nwith whom she had associated in her youth. She herself attended the public \nschools for colored children, but her children, who were rather swarthy, \nwent to the white schools. \n     The \"Jim Crow\" law as applied to the street cars of New Orleans had \nbeen in operation just 15 days when the city criminal court decided it \nwas unconstitutional in that it \"compelled conductors to determine \nwhich were white and which colored, and this is not their \nprovince or power.\"\n     This very difficulty of distinguishing between white and colored people \nhas caused several railroad companies to part with considerable cash. \nIn one southern state,a few years ago , a wealthy white woman with a rich \nolive complexion was forced to take a seat in the \"Jim Crow\" car because \nthe conductor told her he knew she was colored and he was hard to fooll. \nHer husband sued the railroad company for $50,000, but compromised \non $20,000. \n     In Kentucky a white man was forcibly ejected from a coach set aside \nfor people of his own race and placed in a \"Jim Crow\" car. The railroad \ncompany paid him $10,000 for making such a terrible blunder. \n     That the courts consider it a disgrace and a misfortune to be colored \nis shown by the large amounts cheerfully awarded in order to heal the \nwounded feelings of white people who have been mistaken for colored. \nA colored man,who is much fairer than the average Caucasian, was once \nforced out of a \"Jim Crow\" car, where he was conversing with some of his \nfriends, into the coach set aside for white people, in which the conductor \ninsisted he belonged.

If there had been any doubt in her mind about the\ngenuineness of these particular night doctors, it would have been dispelled\nby the noiseless movement of the wheels.  Rubber tires were a new\nthing under the sun.  Mr. West's carriage had just been purchased, so\nthat the attention of the cook had not been called to this particular\nfeature. \n     After Sofronia was captured, Brownie took a short cut to the vacant\nhouse, while the carriage kept a block or two out of the way to accomodate\nhim.  He unlocked the front door and then ran a short distance\nfrom the premises before the party arrived.\n\n\n6.\n\n     \"How is your health?\" said Night Doctor No. 1 to Sofronia, as he was\ndriving her noiselessly along to her doom.  He was one of Brownie's \nyoung friends who was studying medicine and who was indebted to the kind-hearted\ncoachman for more than one lift to tide him over his financial\ntroubles.\n\n     \"I'se jes' as well as a human bein' could possibly be,\" replied the\nprospective victim of medical science.  \"I clar' ter goodness I never\nwas sick a day in my life.\"\n\n     \"It may be,\" interrupted Night Doctor No. 2 \"that she is too healthy\nto use as a subject.\"\n\n     \"Deed an double 'deed I is,\" assented Sofronia quickly.  \"If you're\nlooking for folks what's got intrustin' ailments, 'taint no use fer to\ntake me ter no hospital.\"\n\n     \"Well,\" said the other Night Doctor, \"we'll see about that later on.\nHealthy people are just the kind we want sometimes.\"\n\n     Then and there words failed Sofronia.  She was too frightened to\nreply.  In a very few minutes the carraige reached the vacant house.\nA halt was made.  Night Doctor No. 2 jumped out and rushed up the steps. \nHe opened the front door and closed it with a bang.  Night Doctor No. 1\nassisted Sofronia to alight.  Her impulse to scream was restrained both\nbecause she feared her jugular vein would be cut and because she entertained\nthe hope that she might prove to be too healthy to be of any\nservice to the night doctors.  Sofronia was being ordered to walk right\nalong, when a man came rushing up breathless.\n\n     \"What is all dis hyer?\" he shouted.\n\n     \"Its's me, it's me, your Sofronia, Brownie, and the night doctors got\nme an' goin' to cut me up.  Save me, save me/ fer de Lawd's sake.\"\n\n      \"Let her go at wunst, er I'll make mince meat er yer,\" demanded\nBrownie, who thereupon overpowered the night doctors, and put them to ", "8", 108, 108, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-024:00099", "4\n\nquestioned concerning the use he intended to make of them he told Mr. \nCabot it was part of his plan to \"make Venus treat me right.\" \"Look our \nand mind you don't get into trouble. A man who is as deeply in love as you \nare. Brownie, is apt to go too far.\" But the love-sick swain assured his \nemployer that he was not so far gone that he didn't know his business \nand promised that no arm should come to himself or anybody else.\n\n     Brownie knew the policeman whose duty it was to guard the peace in the \nneighborhood of the unrented house. He was also on quite intimate terms \nwith a cook who didn't live a hundred miles away and who was in the habit \nof lavishing upon this particular officer any toothsome dish she thought \nwould tempt his palate. To her Brownie went.   \n\n     \"Martha,\" said he, \"I'll give you a brand new black alapacker dress, ef \nyou keep pleeceman Diggs roun' here from eight till nine o'clock Wednesday \nnight. I'm jes goin' to play a little joke on a fren', and I'm afraid \nhe'll interfere wid it.\"\n\n     \"Now, Brownie,\" said Martha with a righteous air, \"I'm a 'spectable, \nhones' ooman; I dont want to git in no trouble myself and I dont want to \nhep nobody else into none.\"\n\n     Thereupon Brownie called heaven and earth to witness that he had never \nharmed a hair of anybody's head from the day of his nativity to that moment,\nand reminded Martha of his good name and unblemished reputation. \nThen Martha gave another exhibition of the eternal feminine by yielding. \nBrownie was assured that her good friend, the pleeceman, would be nowhere \nnear the vacant house between the hours of eight and nine o'clock next   \nWednesday night. In order to clinch matters better Brownie paid Martha a \ndelicate little compliment by telling her she was the only woman of his \nacquaintance who could keep her right hand guessing what her left hand \nwas doing. He pledged her again to eternal secrecy and promised faithfully \nthat she should know all about the joke in a few days. \n\n     Georgeously bedecked an bejewelled, Venus, the proud and obdurate, \n\n\n5\n\nstarted out with Brownie to the fair. The night was dark- very dark. The \nheavens were a huge block of blackness which was relieved neither by moon \nnor by star. Arm in arm the couple were walking when suddenly a man \nappeared near the vacant house and asked if he might speak a word privately  \nwith Brownie. The two men had no sooner stepped aside than there was a \nslight confusion somewhere in the darkness nearby. \n\n     Just as Venus turned around to discover the cause, she was blindfolded. \nBefore she had time to recover sufficiently from the shock to scream, a \nsepuchral voice announced that the men who had captured her were night \ndoctors who wanted somebody to dissect. \"Dont scream,\" said the voice, \"for  \nwe always cut the jugular vein of a woman who raises a disturbance. If \nyou keep quiet we'll just take you to the hospital and have the other doctors \nsee what a fine specimen of a perfectly healthy woman you are. You \nare too fat to dissect, I think.\" \n\nThe spokesman was one of Brownie's young friends who was studying medicine \nand who was indebted to the kind-hearted coachman for more than one \nlift to tide him over his financial troubles. Into the carriage with rubber \ntires poor Venus was put more dead than alive. If there had been any \ndoubt in her mind about the genuineness of these particular night doctors, \nthey would have all been dispelled by the noiseless movement of the carriage \nwheels. \n\nWithin two minutes the party reached the vacant house. The trembling \nvictim of the night doctors was just being lifted from the carriage, when \na well-known voice shouted, \"What yer doin' heah with this lady, you scoundruls. \nLet her go at wunst, or I'll make mince meat uv yer.\"\n\nAnd then Brownie with the courage of an African chieftain and the     \nstrength of Samson overpowered the night doctors, put them to flight and \nrescued the trembling Venus, just as she thought she was to be sacrificed \na victim upon the alter of medical science. \n\nWhen speech had returned, Venus fell upon Brownie's neck and thanked\n[him, until she was breathless from]\n \n   \n     \n    \n\n   ", "14", 110, 110, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-023:00014", "4\nNot a few people here feel that Mr. West's statement that he would not \nenforce the law until he knew the eventual outcome of the legislation was \n[sort of] an undeserved affront to Judges Cayton and Claggett who rendered the decision.  From [their] that point of view Mr. West's swift decision not to enforce the law \nseemed to indicate that he [was not sure] doubted that the[ir] decision rendered by those two judges could be depended \nupon.  Attorneys who have practiced here for a long time say they can \nnot recall a Corporation Counsel who has refused to [administer] enforce a law declared valid by the Municipal Court of Appeals or any other Court. [* P 4 1/2*] \nPersonally, it distressed me greatly when I think Mr. West will not be happy \nuntil this lost law goes to the Supreme Court of the USA.  There is no doubt whatever that the Supreme \nCourt will affirm the decision of the Municipal Court of Appeals.  But I \nam no longer Sweet Sixteen and I would like to live long enough to see this \nlaw enforced.  Sometimes, you know, it takes several years to carry a case to \nthe Supreme Court, and I dont want to take any chances.\nThe truth of the matter is that placing the Capital of a country call \nthe Greatest Democracy on earth on southern soil where slavery flourished for \nnearly 300 years presents difficulties which are exceedingly hard to surmount \nand adds up to what may rightly be called a tragedy.  If the Capital of the \nUnited States had been placed in a city in the North, East or West-in Philadelphia \nor in New York, for instance, where it was once located it is safe to wager no Corporation Counsel would have refused to enforce a law removing an injustice from \ncolored people.  The status of colored people would be much more favorable \nthan it is today and the reputation of the United States as a Democracy would \nbe much better all over the civilized world. [*See 4 3/4*] \nIt seems impossible to destroy the traditions and customs of the South. \nUnlike the old soldiers they neither die nor fade away.  \nIg  It pains me greatly to think that the Capital of my own country - \nthe Capital of the United States of America-is the only Capital in the whole \nwide world in which restaurants and hotels refuse to serve colored people \non account of their race.  Our boys [for their country] who are fighting [for the freedom of others] in Korea can go into the \nhotels and restaurants of any country in Europe and be served, but are refused \n[which they do not possess themselves] service in the Capital of their \nown country for which they were willing to fight and [risk their lives] die.  \nWhen I came here sixty years ago I did not dream that sixty years from that \ndate colored people here would still be subjected to practically the same discrimination and segregation as they were at that time.  But colored people still \nare excluded from the movies on F Street and are still refused service in \nmany hotels and eating places just as they were sixty years ago. [*See 4 1/2*]\nIt is hard to imagine\n\n\n\n4 1/2\nIt is hard to imagine a more inopportune time than the present for \nCorporation Counsel West to refuse to enforce the Anti-Discrimination Law and \nto encourage the proprietors of hotels and all the other eating places here \nto refuse to serve colored people by promising not to prosecute them.  We are \nin a desperate struggle with a country inhabited by colored people who reporters \ntell us, hate white people.  This very minute out of every five human being \nin this world four of them have complexions black, brown or yellow to every one whose face is white. That [me]\nmeans that today four-fifths of the population of the world are colored people \n[*See page 5*]               [*4 1/2*]\nRussia is assiduously", "8", 111, 111, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-021:00306", "8\nthat slavery placed a premium upon transgressions of the moral law/\nthe wonder is, not that evils crept into the Negro church, but that it \nhas in the main exerted such a powerful influence for good.  Through the \nmedium of the church the colored people have learned lessons along many \nlines which could not possible have been taught them in any other way, \nand they have gained strength which could not have bee developed through \nany other source.  In staring disagreeable facts in the face, justice \ndemads that we cheerfully acknowledge the great good which has come through \nthe medium of the church.\nAs great as has been the work accomplished by the Negro church, if there \nis one lesson more than another which the past forty years teach us, it \nis the crying need, the absolute necessity of an educated moral ministry.\nIt is difficult to imagine how the colored women of the country could \nrender a greater service to the race than by insisting that the men who \nwant to be [the] its spiritual guides of the race and who stand in the \nsanctuary [of the] as representatives of the Most High God shall present \nthemselves pure and spotless before the world.\nEvery woman who respects herself and, is truly interested in the welfare \nof her race should see to it, so far as in her lies, that none other shall \npreach in the church to which she belongs.  The woman who knows that the \nminister whom she supports either by her money or her presence at the \nservices which she conducts, isda whited sepulchre and a moral leper, and \ndoes nothing but shake her head sorrowfully and sigh sadly about the is \nderelict in her duty and is recreant to her trust.  There are thoughtful \nmen, who are generally considered as charitable as they are thoughtful, who \ninsist that the responsibility of retaining in the ministry men who spread \nmoral ruin, wherever they go, rests entirely with the women of the race.\nThis charge against us [the women of the race] is grave and solemn indeed.  \nGod grant that it is false.\n\"I was invited to deliver an address in a certain town not long ago,\" sid\n\n\n\n9\none of the best known men of the race,\"and in the course of my remarks I\ntook occasion to score the colored churches for allowing menwho despoil\nour women and defile the home to disgrace their sacred callin.  When I had\nfinished my address\", said he, \"a man who was a member of the cburch in\nwhich I spoke took me aside and asked me who had been talking to me ablut\nhis monister.  \"I know nothing whatever about your pastor\". said I \"was\ndescribing a class and not any one particular individual.  \"Well, said the\nman, \"you hit the nail square on the head.  Every word you said about him\nwas true\". \"Why dont you get rid of such a disgrace upon our ministry\nI asked. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves to keep him\"? sai I\n\"We dont dare to touch him\", insisted ther man. \"If we tried to get rid\nof that minister, the women would raise the very roof off the church\".\nIn pondering the significance of this anecdote, it is well to consider\nthat the individual who told it first is a man and he who related it to em is [the] man\nwith certain inherited tendencies from his great grand father, Adam.\nWhen it comes to unloading responsibility for any fault or defect in the\nchurch as elsewhere, the average man, whether black, white grizzle or gray\nmay be safely depended upon to make his scapegoat, a woman. Lord, this\nwoman thou gavest me, she did eat at the apple is still the height of fashion\nand the very latest thing in ethics as dispensed to woman by man.\nWhatever sin of omission colored women may have committed in the past,\neither through ignorance of their responsibility or of their power, let\nthem clear their skirts by acting vigor and determination in the years to\ncome. Let them cry out against the clerical hypocrites who in the cloak\nof religion commit crimes against the human and devine law of which demons\nshould be ashamed. When the women insist that the pulpit shall be pure,\nthe day of the immoral minister shall darken to dawn no more. It may be\nurged and justly so, that in spite of the fact that women work more industriously\nand conscientiously for the upbuilding of the Mormon church, yet the government\nof the church rests almost entirely in the hands of men.

Max Barber,  Editor,  The Voice.\n\nFORD'S HAIR POMADE, formerly known as \"OZONIZED OX MARROW,\" so straightens Kinky\nor Curly Hair that it can be put up in any style desired consistent with its length, and is the only safe\npreparation known to us that makes Kinky or Curly Hair Straight.  Its use makes the most\nstubborn, harsh, kinky or curly hair soft pliable and easy to comb.  These results may be obtained\nfrom one treatment;  2 to 4 bottles are usually sufficient for a year.  The use of FORD'S HAIR POMADE\nremoves and prevents dandruff, relieves itching, invigorates the scalp, stops the hair from falling out or breaking\noff, makes it grow, and by nourishing the roots, gives it new life and vigor.  Being elegantly perfumed and\nharmless, it is a toilet necessity for ladies, gentlemen and children.  FORD'S HAIR POMADE, formerly \nknown as \"Ozonized Ox Marrow\" has been made and sold continuously since about 1858, and the label, \"OZONIZED\nOX MARROW,\" was registered in the United States Patent Office in 1874.  Be sure to get Ford's, as its use\nmakes the hair STRAIGHT, SOFT AND PLIABLE.  Beware of imitations.  Remember that FORD'S HAIR \nPOMADE is put up only in 50c. size and is made only in Chicago and by us.  The genuine has the signature,\nCharles Ford, Prest. on each package.  Refuse all others.

Gordon\nFormer Major-General Confederate Army, United States Senator from Georgia, Ex-Governor of Georgia\ndied Commander United Confederate Veterans, Author \"War Reminiscences,\" Etc.\n\nIN RECENT YEARS much has been written about the Negro-some of it fanciful, some\nill-considered, some malicious, and some utterly fallacious, misleading and dangerous.\nThrough a generation of the most eventful times in the history of the world he has been\nunder the necessity of making his own way in the presence of a strong,\nconquering race\nwhich won its freedom and achieved its civilization in the struggle and conquest of thousands\nof years.  We are at a sufficient distance from the War to pause and take stock of the colored\nman's achievements.  What use has he made of the liberty purchased at the price of so much\nprecious blood?  What progress has he made at solving the problem of himself and his future?\nWhat data has he furnished, in what he has done and learned and become, upon which a \nreliable opinion can be based concerning his future career?  Has he moved forward or gone\nbackward?  Has he climbed or descended?  Has he furnished grounds of hope for him, or\nreasons for despair of him?  Where does he stand at the beginning of the Twentieth Century?  In\nwhat direction is he looking, toward the stars or toward the earth?\nThis book is a record of the Negro's doings.  It is not a work of fine-spun theories on the race\nquestion, but is a summary of the actual accomplishments and attainments of the colored man.\nWe have brought to our attention what the Negro has done as a farmer, as a mechanic, as a doctor, as a lawyer,\nas a teacher, as a literary man, as a poet, as a minister to foreign countries, as a preacher, and as a president and organizer\nof great industrial colleges.\nThis book is a cloth and paper edition of a Negro's World's Fair and the illustrations make a splendid portrait\ngallery of the illustrious men of the race.\nPRICE LOW.

To be sure it is claimed that Egyptians are not classed as Africans, as that word is generally used.  But nobody knows how to close was the connection between the Ethiopians and Egyptians.  Besides, you must remember that Africa is Africa. There are many things which affect the progress of people.  The climate for instance.  If Africans had lived in Europe and Europeans had been indigenous to African soil, I doubt very much indeed that the white men would have done any more in Africa than have the Africans themselves.  As it is, Europeans have not done so well in Africa.  Have you read General Butler's Book?  He claims that Africa will always be the black man's continent.  He says the existence of certain kind of mosquito alone will make it impossible for the white man to thrive, if he can live at all, in Africa.  According to General Butler this particular mosquito first bites a black child which is not at all injured by the kiss and then bites a white man who dies.: Mr. and Mrs. Stead were very much amused at General Butler's discovery and deductions, - \"Who know,\" queries Mr. Stead, \"but there may be something in it.  Even a mosquito may have a great deal to do with the civilization of the country.\"  Just then a knock was heard, the door opened and in walked the editor, who took upon himself the delightful task of escorting Mr. Stead around and advising him what not to discuss.  My doom was sealed, I knew, and I accepted my fate with philosophical resignation.  \"You did not mind my tell Mr. Stead he must not discuss the race problem, did you Mrs. Terrell?\" cooling inquired the Editor.  \"Certainly I did,\" I replied, following the example set by the Father of his Country.  Then the editor launched forth upon such a tirade about malicious newspaper people, who violate all the properties and outrage good taste and lack everything which resembles prudence and common sense that the paid of bidding Mr. Stead good bye was considerably lessened, so overcome was I with confusion and shame at the terrible arraignment which the editor made and crushed with the knowledge of my sins.  I did not regret my temerity, however, and was glad I succeeded in securing the great and brilliant and generous-hearted Stead's opinion of Africans in South Africa, if he was not permitted by his literary mentor to discuss the race problem in the United States.\n\nHotel Maceo\n213 West 53d Street\nNew York City\n\"First class accommodations only.

Nashville, Tenn.\n\n\nA Great Opportunity\n   Business considerations aside, Opportunity is knocking at the door of the man who really wants to help to shape the sentiment in the right direction on the race question.  Probably never again will the opportunity come to you when you can do so much good with such a small amount of money.  The circulation of THE VOICE is growing faster than our financial ability to take care of it.  If you approve of our policy, you must desire to see our circulation pushed up to a million.  Every dollar invested with us enables us to hire a stronger and better force of workers to help us put THE VOICE into every home in the land.\n   The time is ripe for a hard-hitting unsparing campaign of opposition to the encroachments of race prejudice. We must strike hard right now, or the American mind will settle down in the rut where class doctrines will be tolerated. How much will you give to help curry on this unsparing onslaught against race discriminations?  You cannot carry on the battle yourself, perhaps.  You are so situated that you individually must be silent.  how much is it worth to you and your children to see this nation shake off her moral apathy and recognize a man on his merits?  Twenty dollars? Thirty? One Hundred? Then give and invest at the same time.\n\nA Gigantic Conspiracy\n  That the pen is mightier than the sword but few will deny.  nobody knows this better than the tyrannical white South.  Recently a prominent Southerner addressing a graduating class of young white men, said: \"Young men, if you want to be patriotic to your section, if you want to do your duty to the South, go North and get on the Norther newspaper staffs and help to change sentiment toward the Negro in that section.\"  The Associate Press has already been turned over to the South.  Already many large Northern newspapers are edited by Southerners.  Watch the local columns.  Do you see how differently reporters speak of Negroes now from the way they used to speak?  There is a Gigantic Conspiracy afoot to turn public sentiment in the North against the Negro and the South is the head of that conspiracy.  Our people are becoming dimly aware of the value of the press to a cause. We must reach the mind of the American people.  We must counteract with mischievous influence Negro-haters are setting up in the land.  To do this we much maintain an organ which commands respect before the reading world. THE VOICE has a large circulation among the white people of America.\n\nThe Magazine With a Purpose\n  THE VOICE is a magazine with a purpose back of it.  And that purpose is not merely to entertain and instruct the public.  It openly avows itself to be a sentiment-shaping periodical.  It is devoted to the unraveling of the snarl fo the Color Problem and is published to the end that justice may prevail in the land, that lawlessness and bigotry may be wiped out and that the fetish of color prejudice may pass away forever.\n\nOur History\n   THE VOICE was launched in Atlanta, Ga., more than three years ago.  It came in the very niche of time.  Public opinion was rapidly turning against the American Negro.  The white press had very industriously circulated many mean misrepresentations of the colored people and other sections of the country had gradually changed their attitude of friendliness to the Negro to that of acquiescence in Southern infamies. The meantime the Negro himself had no organ or periodical which could contradict these false charges in such a way that the contradictions would command respect and arrest public attention.  To that end came the VOICE into existence.  Its 50,000 readers, ranging from members of the United States Senate down to the commonest laborer will attest to the fact hat we have helped very materially in changing opinio9n and puncturing some hoary falsehoods.\n   During the last three years w have published a greater number of high-class articles on the American race problem that were ever published in any American magazine.  We have introduced to the public more Negro writers with literary ability than any other magazine has ever introduced to the public. WE have acquainted the Negro race with itself, with its own marvelous prosperity and with the new movement afoot whereby the freedom of the race was being marketed for a paltry mess of pottage.  We have awakened the race to the seriousness of the situation.  More than that, we have discovered for the race more real, genuine white friends than any other magazine in America.  And we have also exposed more white and black fraud and hypocrites. \n   We were driven out of Atlanta because of our stand for the colored people; and that is why we are in Chicago\n\nFINALLY\n   We want you to take some stock in our concern. You individually, we are talking to.  We want you to become interested in us in every way, to identify yourself with this movement to circulate righteous ideas.  You out to help to keep us from being financially cramped, so that we can spread and push the fight.  What say you? If you can't take stock, go out and persuade your neighbor.  But in order to really persuade your neighbor you yourself out to do something.

And the longer such a thing\nis tolerated, the less chance is there\nfor the state to grow into the kind of\ncommonwealth it should be and is\nultimately destined to become.\nWhat we see in New York we\nbehold everywhere-these two forces\neternally at war, one seeking to destroy\nthe nation, the other seeking to\nsave it:  Intemperance against temperance,\ndishonesty against honest,\nbribery against integrity, anarchy\nagainst law.  The most discouraging\nfeature of it all is that, in the midst\nof these dangers, so many citizens\nshow such smug satisfaction with\nthings as they are and say\n\"Everything will be all right.\"\nIf this law of history is true, everything\nwill not be all right unless we\ntake pains to make and keep it right.\nIf we could once fully realize that\nthese evils affect our whole life, we\nwould not continue to look upon \nthem as events of passing moment.\nIV.  This entire trend of modern\nlife makes the question of \"Citizenship\"\none of great significance and \nof commanding importance.  It gives\na personal character to the whole\nmovement.\nWhen Americans discuss the question \nof \"Citizenship,\" there are several\nthings for us to remember.\n(1)  That American Citizenship\ndiffers very radically from Russian\ncitizenship or citizenship under any\nmonarchical or semi-monarchical form\nof Government.  In Russia one man\nis a ruler; in America, as Justice\nBrewer of the Supreme Court pointed\nout in his Yale lecture, \"each man is\na ruler * * Government of the people,\nthat government which exists among\nus, means that each man is a ruler,\neach share the responsibilities of\ngovernment.\"\n(2)  The above, being true, then it\nfollows that no man can rule for\nanother.  It is absolutely impossible\nfor you and me to shift our citizenship\nupon anybody else.  To quote\nJustice Brewer again:  \"If each man\nis a ruler, then upon each rests the\n\nobligation of a ruler.  That there are\nmany rulers may diminish the effect\nof the separate action of any\nsingle one, but it does not change\nthe fact that upon each rests the \nobligation of a ruler.  Upon him lies\nthe burden of government.  As he\nacts, so the nation acts.   And there\nis no man in this country who can\nsay he has nothing to do with the\naction of the government  *  *  *\nEvery American can say 'The Nation!\nI am the Nation!'  And that fact of\npersonal responsibility, that sense of\ngovernmental duty, gives strength\nand importance to the responsibilities\nof the American citizen.\"\nV.  Citizenship is thus narrowed\ndown to the Individual.  The question\nwhich concerns us is \"What Is\nGood Citizenship?\"  What can men\nand women do t show that they are\ngood citizens?  I might enumerate\nfor you a long list of things that we\nmay do to show our citizenship.  But\nthat would not be half so effective as\nto point out the essence of Citizenship;\nfor out of this fundamental principle\nall acts of citizenship arise.\nThe fundamental principle of Citizenship\nfor you and me is simply\n\"A Righteous Life.\"  If we have that,\nall other things will take care of\nthemselves.  The life of the Nation\nis merely the sum total of the lives of\nthe inhabitants of the Nation.  If it\nis \"Righteousness\" which exalted\nthe Nation, then its exaltation depends\nentirely upon the righteousness\nwhich exalts the individual citizen.\nIf you are not living a righteous life\nthe entire Nation is to that extent\ndisgraced; if you are, it is to that \nextent exalted.  There is no such\nthing as abstract Righteousness of\nabstract Nationality.  The Nation\ncan rise no higher than its citizens\nrise, and every time they fall it falls.\nNo, it is entirely a question of\ncharacter, and the Nation is coming\nto realize it.  The Nation is to-day\ndemanding character - character in\nvoters, character in officeholders,\ncharacter in laws, character in business\n-character in everything.  The \nNation is making this demand because\n\n\n29\n\nit realizes that nothing can\ntake the place of character and because\nit is not willing to accept any\nsubstitutes.  Some officeholders seem\nto think that they can deceive the\nNation by handing out such substitutes\nas favoritism, excuses, pretensions.\nSome of our honorable legislators, \nwho have the faculty of voting\nwrong on every moral issue, excel in\nFourth of July oratory.  I know a \nman who was elected to the Legislature\nby a large majority.  During\ntwo sessions he voted on the wrong\nside of practically every question,\nand that in spite of the fact that his\nconstituents deluged him with letters\nand telegrams notifying him to vote\notherwise.  He disgraced himself,\nlost the respect of his fellow-citizens\nand brought shame on the district\nwhich elected him.  Then he returned\nto his native town and delivered a \nlong speech on \"Civic Righteousness,\"\nin which he drew a graphic\npicture of the Nation's prosperity\nand fame, stirred the emotions of his\nhearers by mawkish sentiment regarding\n\"Old Glory\" and \"The Stars \nand Stripes,\" and concluded by\nmaking an impassioned appeal for\nCivic Righteousness.  His constituents\nexhibited their Civic Righteousness\nat the next election by cutting\ndown his majority by three thousand\nvotes, and at the next one by retiring\nhim to private life.\nVI.  I think we all recognize the\ntruth of King Solomon's declaration.\nRighteousness is Citizenship, and\nrighteousness shows itself in our\ntown, in our homes, in respect for\nlaw, in law enforcement, in the\npromotion of Temperance and Sabbath\nObservance, in high ethical standards\non business-in everything that we \ndo or say or think.  It is seen in\nbeautifying the town; and while we\nare assembling here to honor the\nConvention of 1848, it is well for the\nwomen of the town to consider the\nproposition of organizing for civic\nbetterment in this respect, as in\nothers.\nWhat is the highest incentive to\nRighteousness? Religion.  It is\nsignificant that the two nations,\nwhich, to-day, exert the greatest\ninfluence for good in the world\n-England and America-are both,\nnominally at least, Christian Nations.\nReligion develops character, and in\nso doing Religion alone can save the\nstate.  \"Blessed is that nation whose\nGod is the Lord,\" and woe to that\nnation which forgets God and sins\nagainst God.  This was Kipling's\nwarning to England during the\nQueen's Jubilee:\n\n\"God of our fathers, known of old-\nLord of our far-flung battle-line-\nBeneath whose awful hand we hold\nDominion over palm and pine-\nLord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\nLest we forget-lest we forget.\n\nThe tumult and the shouting dies-\nThe captains and the king's depart.\nStill stands thine ancient sacrifice,\nAn humble and a contrite heart.\nLord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\nLest we forget-lest we forget.\n\nFar-called our navies melt away-\nOn dune and headland sinks the fire-\nLo, all our pomp of yesterday\nIs one with Nineveh and Tyre!\nJudge of the Nations, spare us yet,\nLest we forget-lest we forget.\n\nIf, drunk with sight of power, we loose\nWild tongues that have not Thee in awe-\nSuch boastings as the Gentiles use\nOr lesser breeds without the law-\nLord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\nLest we forget-lest we forget.\n\nFor heathen heart that puts her trust\nIn reeking tube and iron shard-\nAll valiant dust that builds on dust,\nAnd guarding calls not thee to guard-\nFor frantic boast and foolish word\nThy mercy on They people, Lord.\n\n'CIVIC RIGHTEOUSNESS'\nBY REV. WM. BOURS CLARKE, TRINITY EPISCOPAL CHURCH.\nSUNDAY, MAY 24TH, 10:30 A. M.\n\nPs. 37; 27-28:-Flee from evil and\ndo the thing that is good; and\ndwell forevermore.  For the Lord\n\nloveth the thing that is right; he\nforsaketh not his that be godly,\nbut they are preserved forever.", "52", 114, 114, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00368", "30\n\nThe subject this morning is of\ninfinite importance to us all-to old\nand young, as individuals or as a \ncommunity.  It was announced as\ncivic righteousness; transposed it\nspells good citizenship.  Righteousness\nis goodness; the acting right and\nbeing right before God and man.\nCivic, derived from the Latin civis, a\ncitizen has reference to the rights and\nduties of citizenship.  It is a very\nlarge subject, for it includes most of\nthe relations of life, and it has its\nbeginning, its starting place, in the\nindividual, and then in the home, and \nthen in the community.  For as is\nthe individual so is the home; as is\nthe home so is the community.  And\nso we have first of all a lesson for the\nfathers and mothers  If you were\nentrusted with an exquisite uncut\ndiamond, and were ordered by God\nto polish it and inscribe upon it high\nand lofty sentiments, it would be\nnecessary for you to do that work to\nspend infinite time and patience upon\nit.  And yet God has entrusted to\nfathers and mothers more priceless\njewels than even diamonds-the immortals\nsouls of the children He has\ngiven them, and upon those souls\nthey are to see that there are written\nhigh and holy thoughts and desires\nthat shall be manifested in high and\nholy lives.\nAnd so, first of all, we may speak\nof the dangers that threaten children.\nFirst, those that come from their\ncompanionships.  It is the most important\nthing in all the world to\nchoose good companions.  The children\nare at the formative age, the\nimpressionable age, when they are\ninfluenced by all with which they\ncome in contact; and it is, of, so\nnecessary that the comrades that they\nchoose should be those who would\nhelp them and not harm them.  If\nyou will go with me any day in the\nafternoon up to our park by the railroad\nwhere the boys are playing after\nthey are let out of school, and listen\nto the words that are there used-\nwords of profanity and coarse, foul\ntalk-you would agree with me that \nit behooves the fathers and mothers in \n\nthis community to get to work and\ncure such a condition of affairs.  It is\ndangerous for the boys of those\nfathers and mothers to grow up amid\nsuch surroundings.  Every father and\nevery mother should always know\nwhere and with whom their children\nare.  When we walk every night\nupon our streets, we meet scores of\nyoung boys and girls together, and\nthe danger that exists is beyond all\ncomputation.  The boys and girls\nought not to be allowed out together\nafter dark unless they are accompanied,\nunless the fathers and mothers\nknow just where they are.  It would\nbe far better for the mother at the\nrisk of a few foolish tears to keep her\ngirl at home at night and save the\nsea of tears that would flow later on,\nfrom a broken-hearted mother and a\nwretched broken hearted girl.  If the\nfather allows his business duties, his\nfatigue after his day's work, his love\nof pleasure, in any degree, to prevent\nhis coming close to his boy, to learn\nwhat his thoughts are, where he finds\nhis pleasure, and does not strive to\nlead the boy up in the scale of being,\nto make him realize that the only\nman who is respected and respectable\nis the man who leads an upright,\nChristian life,-if the father does not\ntake that pains; and if the mother\ngives over her children to the care of\nservants in order to get them out of\nthe way, or for her love of social\npleasure turns them out of doors to\ngo where they may; then that father\nand that mother are sowing the whirlwind\nthat they will reap some day in\ndreadful consequences.\nThe psalmist prays, \"that our sons\nmay grow up as the young plants\nand our daughters may be as the \npolished corners of the temple.\"\nHow do you treat young plants?  Do\nyou let them alone?  Are they apt to\ngrow and increase and yield fruit if\nthey are let alone?  The weeds and\nthorns will spring up with them and\nwill surely choke them unless they\nare removed.  If our sons are to grow\nup as the young plants and bear fruit,\nthey must be looked after; and if our \ndaughters are to be as the polished \n\n31\n\ncorners of the temple, there must be\nlabor spent in polishing them.  Not\nthe outward, useless polish of fashion\n-that does not count, for while\n\"fine feathers\" may \"make fine birds\"\nyet dress and outward show do not\nnecessarily indicate true womanhood\n-but the polish that is true.  As the\nApostle wrote, \"whose adorning let\nit not be that outward adorning of\nplaiting the hair, and of wearing of\ngold, or of putting on of apparel; but\nlet it be the hidden man of the heart,\nin that which is not corruptible, even\nthe ornament of a meek and quiet\nspirit which is in the sight of God of\ngreat price.\"  We burnish gold, not\nlead.  We polish granite or marble,\nnot sandstone.  There must be foundation\nfor the polish, something real.\nAnd it needs hard work.  It needs\nwork all the time.  And the father\nand the mother that does not give\nthat work is the father or mother who\nin the last great day shall face the\njudgment throne of Christ and be\nresponsible for the failures, the mistakes,\nthe sins, of the children that\nGod has given them.\nLet us turn now to the duties of the\ngrown up citizens.  There are three\nthings, it seems to me, that are\nnecessary for better citizenship, for\ncivic righteousness.  The first, the\nelimination of partisan politics.  \"All\nthe evils of municipal government in\nour country,\" it has been written,\n\"can be traced to the fact that the\nbusiness of governing our municipalities\nhas been made so largely a matter \nof politics and, therefore, so largely\nof politicians.  The political managers,\ncommonly called \"bosses,\" find\nit profitable to maintain national\nparty lines in municipal elections.\nSo long as they can delude the best\nmen of both parties into thinking\nthat national, or even state issues,\nshould be considered in municipal\nelections, or that they should vote\nfor political reasons in any matter\ninvolving municipal interests, they\ncan be perfectly sure that their\noccupation will not be gone.  The\nmajority of the voters, taking both\nparties together in any American \n\nmunicipality, will always be sufficiently\npublic spirited, to want the\nright things.  But the difficulty is to\nget such men belonging to the different\nparties to act together for the \ncommon good.  Every now and then,\nwhen what our friends, the enemy,\nnot inaptly call 'a spasm of reform,'\npasses over some municipality where\nthe conditions have become particularly\nbad, the voters do act together,\nand usually with success for the time\nbeing.  But it takes a moral convulsion\nto bring them to do this, and the\npoliticians seem to be able to patch\nthings up and bring the voters once\nmore in line.  Yet the elimination of\npartisan politics by some method, and\ntherefore the stimulation of party\nspirit and the creation of wholesome\nand controlling public opinion is\npossible wherever the leaders of any\ncommunity make up their minds that\nthey really want it enough to make\nsacrifices to obtain it.\"  It is utterly\npreposterous that in a village like\nthis, men should be divided, upon\nissues pertinent to the village alone,\non party lines.  It ought to be the\nfact that here the very best men\nshould be put up, and should be voted\nfor, irrespective of parties.\nAnd then there is need of optimism.\nI referred the other night at a public\nmeeting to a tendency which I have\nalways noticed here, and which I have\nalways deplored - a spirit of pessimism.\nThere has been cause for it, no\ndoubt, and it is natural it should\nexist.  But it is not right that it\nshould be suffered to exist any longer.\nThere are as honest men in Seneca\nFalls as there are in any community\nupon the face of the globe; and we \ncan commit into the hands of these\nhonest and faithful men any enterprise\nand be sure that they will bring\nit to an honorable and wise and safe\nconclusion.  And I am speaking now\nwithout any reference whatever to\nlate events.  There ought to be\nsubstituted for that cowardly pessimism\nin this town a brave optimism\nthat will see that the best men have\ncharge of every work, and then will \n", "53", 115, 115, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00128", "The colored child in the US\nHearing Nothing but the inferiority of the\nrace in everything he sees & hears leads\nhim to believe in his innate inferiority.\nEverything is separate for him.

Here four of her children\nwere born.  Here was held 60\nyears ago that Convention the anniversary\nof which we are celebrating\nto-day.  It was called in July 1848 by\nMrs. Stanton and her co-workers,\nLucretia Mott, Martha Wright and\nMary Ann McClintock, called to discuss\nthe questions concerning women\nwhich roused and so impressed Judge\nCady's little daughter.\nMany things led up to that Convention\nof 1848, but I want to tell\nyou of just one thing that followed it,\nand then I have done; one thing that\nwill complete the picture I have been\ndrawing for you.\nFrom Seneca Falls Mrs Stanton\nstarted in 1854 to carry out her\nfather's advice to her as a child-\"Go\nto Albany and ask the legislature to\nalter the laws.\"  Her special plea at\nthis time was to be for the working\nwoman.  The property rights of the\nwell to-do had been won in 1848, but\nthe woman who worked still had no\nright to the wages she earned.  In\n1854 a woman might slave all day at\nthe wash tub, and at night, if a dissolute\nhusband so willed it, the employer\nwas bound to give him his\nwife's earnings.\nOn her journey to Albany, Mrs.\nStanton stopped at Johnstown to see\nher parents.  The knew nothing of\nthis second secret project to \"cut out\nthe bad laws,\" until the Albany Evening\nJournal gave them the news the\nvery evening of their daughter's\narrival.  Judge Cady was horrified; \n\n-his daughter to speak before the \nlegislature, a thing no woman had\never done before!  You see he had\nquite forgotten his old time advice.\nAgain Elizabeth at the evening\nhour appeared before him, but it was\nnot now a meeting between a little\ngirl and a great jurist, but of a mature\nwoman and just another human being.\nHe pleaded with her not to do this \nthing, he urged his age, the disgrace\nshe would bring on the family.  He\ntried to buy her off, promising the\ndeeds of a house she had been wanting\nhim to buy her.  She resisted\nevery attack and finally told him she\nwent at his suggestion.  He protested\nand she reminded him that he had\nsaved his library from destruction by\ntelling her the way to amend laws\nwas to speak to the law makers.  he\nhad to capitulate, and in the end only \nasked that she bring her speech,  \nlet them make it as good as possible.\nShe gladly consented and they worked\nover the speech till far on into the\nnight, he bringing down one book\nafter another to give examples of\ninjustice far worse than those she had\ncited.  And so let us leave the picture \nthere.\nThe lesson for us is;-let us be\ngivers as well as receivers, let us be\ncourageous, let us be determined to\ndo the right, let us rise above opposition,\nlet us not be satisfied to accept\nwhat those who have gone before us\nhave won for the world, let us feel\nour responsibility to win new victories\nfor the good and the right.\n\n\"THE EDUCATIVE VALUE OF POLITICAL LIFE\"\nBY PROF. EARL BARNES.\n\nMr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen:\nI came to this convention this\nmorning with an impression that I\nwas to say something to you about\nthe Educative Value of Political Life.\nI did not know that I was to have an\nopportunity to talk to these children;\nsince I have an opportunity to talk to\ntheses children, I am going to say\nnothing to you.\nChildren, boys and girls, I am\ngoing to try to bring before you some\nimpressions.  The difficulty lies here.\nThat this world of ours-for Seneca\nFalls is one little corner of the great\nstate of New York, one little corner\nof the great United States-this world\nin which we are living today, is so\nbig that hardly anybody sees what it\nmeans.  We are all confused.  I came \n\n43\n\nhere last night on the Lehigh Valley\nrailroad.  I don't understand the Lehigh\nValley railroad.  I don't know\nwho owns it.  It certainly would be\nvery difficult to find out who owns\nit; who the people or persons are who\nactually own it.  I do not know who\nis responsible for its policy.  It is so\ncomplex, so blurred.  The Lehigh\nValley railroad is only a little bit of\nour life.  Even to understand the\nmanagement of this town-to whom\nwe owe obligations for all these splendid\ntrees that line your avenues this \nglorious, splendid, day; to whom we\nowe what is indispensible in this \ntown, would be difficult.  The life of\nall of us is so complex, so difficult, it\nis impossible, difficult for you or me\nto grasp it.  But we can grasp our\nrelation to our life, nevertheless.  I\nwant to make it clear to you.  You\nchildren will have to help me because\nit is a difficult subject. \nI am trying to make it as clear as I \ncan by describing a case where I\ncould look right down on the government\nand see it under my hand, see it\nall at once in my hand.  It was in\nSwitzerland.  I had gone up to Guise,\nway up in the heart of the mountains,\ntwenty miles across.  I went up day\nafter day.

He must appear,\nfollowing the custom of his forefathers,\ndressed in sober black with a \nsword at his side, and must be there\npromptly at half past nine o'clock.\nAny citizen in the canton who is not\npresent and does not present a physician's\ncertificate, will be fined twenty\nfrancs.  I thought that was most\ninteresting.  The nation was coming\ntogether like a real state.  It was\ncoming together on the first Sunday\nof April to transact all the business\nof the year.  So I was in the house\nwhere I could look down into the\nsquare.  About nine o'clock they \ncame in, coming in sometimes singly\nand sometimes in groups, all dressed\nin sober black, and all with their\n\nshort swords, and sheaths at their\nsides, until the square was crowded\nwith some 9,000 men.  On one side a \ngreat platform.  The president entered\nand came on the platform  There\nwas a great hush fell on them, and\nhe said, the reverened so-and-so will\nlead us in prayer, and then he said\nwe will take the oath of allegiance to\nthe state.  As he said this 9,000\nhands flashed on the black mass.\n9,000 hands in unison, with a great\nsea of voices gave the oath of allegiance.\nThen followed the election of officers.\nA loud voiced herald called for\nnominations.  One man shouted a \nname; another man seconded it.  One\nname after another was called out\nuntil a half dozen had been taken\ndown.  Then the first name was\ncalled and all favoring his election\nwere ordered to raise their hands.\nThere was a flash of white over the \n9,000 men in black, and then the\nnext name was voted on; he who\ncalled out the largest flash of white\nwas declared elected.\nHow about the accounts of last\nyear?  They had appointed the year\nbefore an officer to examine the\naccounts.  He came forth and said, \"I\nhave examined the accounts, and here\nis their result; the canton has so\nmuch money.\"  The president said,\n\"Do you agree to that?\"  The white\nhands flashed again.\nHe said, \"We have two laws to pass\nthis year; one, to appoint an officer to\nsee that no cattle are allowed in this \ncanton that are not free from disease;\nyou have all seen the law; it has been\nposted all the year.  All you in favor \nof the law show your hands.\"  Only a \nfew hands went up.   \"All opposed\" -a\ngreat flash of hands went up.  It was\nlost.\n\"There is a law that the barber shops \nshall close at nine o'clock at night.\nAll in favor\" -a great flash of white\nand the law is passed.\nI learned that a law had been presented\nthree years.  The people voted\nit down one year; the second year\nthey favored it and the third year\nthey carried it.", "59", 114, 114, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00375", "44\n\nThen the new officers took their\nplaces.  The nation raised its hands\nand took the oath, repeated by its\nfathers for unknown generations, to\npreserve the liberty and obey they laws\nof the canton; and then the meeting\nbroke up.  A nation had come together \nand done a nation's work.  A \nnation was ready for another year.\nI saw it all in one glance.  We are\ndoing the same thing all the time,\nonly it is vastly more difficult than\nthat.  I am trying to bring home to\nyour minds, especially to you girls,\nwhat that kind of thing means.\nWhat does it do to anybody to\ndo this?\nGive me your eyes.  Listen to me\na moment.\nIf you have to do this particular\nthing-if you have to do it-the very\nfact that you have to do it will make\nyou get ready.  If you don't have to\ndo it, you don't have to get ready.\nI know a man in Philadelphia, a\nfriend of mine, who has for years and\nyears been in architecture  I said to\nhim,  \"Why don't you get together\nthe literature on this subject and get\nthe views of famous men \"  Said he\ndidn't have time.  As soon as he\nbegan to build a house of his own,\nthen he got interested; and he said\nwhat kind of bricks are best, whether\nlimestone or marble trimmings.  Then\nhe got his books and bean to read,\nand he has became an educated man.\nWhen you have to do a thing, you\nget ready for it.  If you have got to\npass laws; if you have got to decide\nwhether the streets shall be improved;\nif you have got to determine on a \ntrolley system for this town; if you\nhave got to decide on shade trees; if\nyou have got to determine whether to\nsell whiskey or not-if you have to\ndetermine these things, you become\ninterested; you have to do it.\nYour fathers in a few days will\nhave to vote for president of the\nUnited States.  Before they can vote\nintelligently, knowingly, for a president\nof the United States, they have\ngot to think about it.  All the questions\nof government come up for \nreview.  Whether it is best for the \n\nUnited States largely to tax goods\nthat come into the country.  They\nhave got to vote on it.  Your fathers\nwill have to pass on it.  The consequence\nis your fathers will inform\nthemselves about it.  They will discuss\nit in different places, listen to\nlectures on these subjects.  They have\ngot to make up their minds whether\nthe country should spend many millions\non the navy; three hundred millions\nof dollars or not on the army.\nIn ten years we have doubled our\narmy and navy estimates ten times;\nis it good?  is it desirable?  That is\nthe question your fathers have got to\nsettle.  They have got to determine\nwhether prohibition prevails over the\ncountry.  They have got to determine\nwhat to do with the Philippines;\nwhat shall be our relations with\nJapan, whether friendly or not.  They\nhave got to think of a thousand\nthings.  When it comes to local politics,\nthen they have got to think\nabout street paving, architecture,\npublic buildings.  Let us remember\nagain, boys and girls, it is important\nand significant things they have got\nto think about.\nThe men and women who amount\nto anything in this town, who are\nreally significant people in this town, \nhave almost all of them been made,\nnot by the common schools-the\ncommon school gave them a start,\njust shoved them a little bit of the\nway.  They have been made by\nreligion and politics.  And it is\nthrough being good churchmen and\nbeing good citizens that they have\nbecome good intelligent men.  That\nis the main thing that is shaping the\nintelligence of Seneca Falls, as it has\nall over the community, as it has all\nover the United States.  But that is\nonly one part of it.  You have got to\ndo more than that.  In order to do\nanything as a citizen, you have got\nto pick out the right kind of people\nto serve you.  I went to a convention\nin Philadelphia.  A lot of political\nmen sat up in front.  One man I had\nheard about for years and years.  It\nwas the \"silver tongued orator of the \nPlatte.\"  I had always heard of him \n\n\n45\n\nbut never seen him.  When this man\ncame in and sat at the table, I thought\nhere is an opportunity; I shall sit\nhere during the hours, I shall see him\neat and hear him speak.  It flashed\nover me, what are you doing?  I am\npassing judgment on this man, my\nsuperior in all directions, a man of\ngreat responsibilities; a man who has\ntraveled around the world.  I am\npassing judgment on him, I am \nmaking up my mind whether I want\nto hire him or not.  It is what every\none has to do all day long.  Make up\nyour mind whether you want to hire\nRoosevelt, Taft, Bryan.  You have\ngot to look them over in a way you\nwould not look at them if you did not\nthink of hiring them.  So you\nanalyze them in every possible way.\nThere is nothing so educative in the \nworld as trying to sift people in this\nway.  In analyzing life it invigorates\nour own makes us strong in turn.\nIt makes you weigh, estimate, measure\nthe public needs, too.  It makes \nyou sit in judgment on men.  We\nbring them under the searchlight of\npublic criticism and discuss them in\nthe public press until we know what\nwe think of them.  That is the kind\nof training that makes strong men\nand women.  It makes the kind of\nmen and women we must have in the\ndemocracy.\nYou cannot afford in a democracy\nlike ours where we are all learning\nby doing it-you cannot afford to\nhave any considerable lot of women\nwho are not in the game.  They must\nplay ball, every one of them.  Now,\nin a democracy, where there is no\nking, no aristocracy, where we all\nhave part-every man and woman\nmust play the game.  If they don't\nplay, they are public nuisances, \na menace and danger to the whole\nthing.  Hear what I am telling you.\nYou cannot afford in a great democracy\nto have a lot of women who\ndon't play the game, who are not\nparticipants.  Why, we have got five\nthousand able soldiers, and then we\nhave got twenty thousand following\nin the rear, camp followers they have\ngot to feed and protect.  If I go to\n\nwar I must have every man a fighter,\nin the front line, and no camp followers\nmust cut off their efficiency; you \nmust have fighters all the way\nthrough the group.  Every boy and\ngirl must get ready for the game.\nEvery man and woman must play\nthe game.  Take heart one more.\nCome back to me and think as hard\nas in the beginning.  To day, in the\nUnited States, half of the people are\nnot playing the game at all.  They \nare shirkers; they are camp followers;\nthey are a danger and a menace to the\nwhole group.  They do not play the\ngame because we are not letting them\nplay the game.  Half of the people\nin the United States to day are along\nin the rear and living on the commissary\ndepartment and are a menace\nto the country.\nWe are glad to-day to do honor to\nthe name and fame of two women\nwho worked here in this town;\nMost of you know something of\nhistory.  If you don't study history,\nyou have seen histories.  Many of\nyou study history.  Did you ever\nthink of this fact?  Ever since the\nworld began, there have been men\nand women in the country.  The \nwomen have not been asleep.  They\nhave been as awake as the men.  They\nhave done as much as the men have.\nConsequently, the history of the last\nsix thousand years is of women as\nwell as men.  If you take the history\nof America to-day, how much of it,\ndo you think, deals with women?  I\nhave gone through five or six of them\nand find this:  If you cut out every\nline that deals with women in any\nway and paste them in an ordinary\nAmerican history, it makes less than\none page.  Notwithstanding you\nhave as many girls as boys in the\nschools of this town, they are taught\nby many more women than men.\nYou-not the women of Seneca Falls;\nbut all over the country-teach these \ngirls exclusive admiration of the acts\nof men.  Isn't that absurb?  It is impossible,\nbut it is true.  Why is that?\nI have got the hardest thing to tell\nyou this afternoon.\nThe world starts historically with", "60", 117, 117, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-002:00486", "Memphis Tenn\nNov. 6/13\n\nDear Mollie\n\nHave just heard that the \nNapier case is set for the 20th of this \nmonth.

What a\nsnare and a delusion!  The majority\nof the disfranchised men in Russia\nand Germany today want to vote and\nare creating great disturbance and revolt\nbecause they are denied the privilege,\nbut the majority of the disfranchised\nare dominated by the powerful\nminority of the enfranchised, and the\nfranchise is withheld.  Even admitting\nthat the majority of women in\nour country are so immersed in ignorance,\nin selfishness, as to wish to \nwithhold thier participation in the\nservice of their country, in its burdens,\nduties and responsibilities-\npremises which I am only willing to\nadmit for the sake of argument-\nevent hen, that is no excuse for withholding\nthe franchise from all women.\nDid the majority of men wish\nto vote before they were enfranchised?\nAt one time only the men who were\nin good standing in the Episcopal\nChurch were permitted to vote-no\nCatholic, no Jew had the privilege-\nand when these men were given the\nfranchise and religious disabilities\nwere eliminated, no doubt many men\nshook their head gravely and wondered\nwhat would become of the\ncountry.  At one time, only men\nwho owned property and paid taxes\non it were entitled to vote; and in\nPhiladelphia, it is related that a man\nvoted for some years because he paid\ntaxes on a donkey which he owned.\nThe the donkey died and the man\nlost his vote, and the question was\nraised at the time as to which of the\ntwo donkeys really had the vote!\nLater on there was less and less legislation\nregarding property rights and\nmore and more concerning conditions\nof labor.  Then this property-holding\nrestriction was taken away from men,\nand finally all males poor and rich,\nblack and white, drunk and sober,\nvicious and virtuous, naturalized or\nnative born, infirm or strong, ignorant\nor intelligent were proclaimed entitled\nto the franchise.  Did the majority\nof the men demand this?  Not\nat all, the franchise was bestowed upon\nthem, not because of their demand,\nbut because it was considered a just \n\nact by those who were already enfranchised.\nIt cannot be stated with absolute\naccuracy that the majority of\nthe men today appreciate the privilege\nof voting.\nA few years ago, in my city, when\na very important election took place\nand great issues were at stake, it was\nfound that about 60,000 men who\nhad registered, had failed to vote.\nThere was no epidemic at the time;\nthey could not all have died between\nregistration day and election day.  A \nsmall portion of them may have been\nprevented from reaching the polls\nthrough sickness or death, but the\nmajority of these men simply didn't\nvalue their privilege of citizenship\nsufficiently-they went automobiling,\nthey went to the country clubs to\nplay golf, they stayed home and said,\n\"Pshaw\" (or something stronger) my\nvote won't make any difference, I\nmight as well save myself the bother\nof standing in line with my ballot.\nIt reminds me of the story of an Italian\nPriest, who had worked faithfully\ntwenty-five years in his parish.\nHis parishioners wanted to make him\na gift, but they were all very poor\nand could not afford to spend much\nmoney.  They decided to build a\nhogshead and place it in his cellar\nand each man agreed to contribute\ntwo bottles of wine and thus fill the\nhogshead for the priest.  When the\nanniversary day arrived each parishioner\ncrept surreptitiously into the\nold priest's cellar, carrying a bottle \nunder each arm.  When the hogshead\nwas filled, the priest was called\nand he was so delighted with his gift\nthat he sent for glasses and invited\nall his donors to have a glass of the\nwine.  He turned the spigot and pure\nwater ran from it.  Each man had\nthought that his two bottles of water\nwould not be discovered in the hogshead\nof wine.\nBut now let us consider a few excuses\nin regard to whether women would\nmake use of the ballot if they were\nenfranchised.  For we sometimes\nhear it said: if women could vote,\nthey would not want to!  Of course\nit is a trait of human nature to value\n\n71\n\nmost what is taken away from us, or \ndenied us, and I have shown that \nmen are not exempt from this indictment.\nIn New Zealand, however,\nwhen women were enfranchised, at\nthe election held in 1905, before the\nwomen had had time to have training\nor had acquired the habit of voting,\nover 83% of those on the electoral\nrolls made use of the privilege bestowed\nupon them and there was but\n84% of men who voted, (according to\nthe written testimony of Sir Joseph\nWard.)  In Colorado, where women\nhave had the full franchise since\n1893, the vote at the second presidential\nelection after the suffrage was\nconferred on them, showed that only \nthree per cent of the women in the\nentire state failed to exercise the suffrage.\nIn Utah, where women have \nhad the franchise since 1896,\nthey exercise this privilege quite as\nextensively as men, for it will be seen\nfrom statistics that women cast nearly\n50 per cent of the entire vote, and\nyet the U. S. census of 1900 showed\nthat males comprised over 51 per cent\nof the population.\nNow, another statement sometimes\nmade by those opposed to the extension\nof the suffrage to women, is that\nmost women would be sure to vote\nfor the best looking man.  Well, I\nadmit that is true; I am sure I would!\nBut remember the old adage: \"Beauty\nis as beauty does.\"  I believe that\nprinciple, integrity, loftiness of purpose,\nintellect and character shine in\nthe face and glorify it.  I believe that\nwhen a man has led a good, pure, uplifting,\nnoble life his countenance\ndepicts the fact.  When he has led a\nvicious, ignoble life one can also see\nsigns of it in his face, and therefore,\nI assert not with shame but with\npride, that history shows that women\ndo want fine types of men for their\npolitical candidates.  In Colorado,\nboth parties are obliged to present\ncandidates of good character in order\nto win the votes of women.  Judge\nLindsley, who has done so much to\nreduce crime among juvenile offenders\nin Denver, Colorado, assets that\nhe owes his re-election to the women\n\nof that city.  When the Democrats\nand Republicans decided not to place\nhis name on their tickets, the women,\nwho are not so easily whipped into\nline by political leaders, held a mass\nmeeting in the largest theatre in\nDenver, nominated Judge Lindsley\nand stated they would elect him on\nan independent ticket.  They were so\nsuccessful that at the last moment\nthe Democrat and Republican parties\nboth decided to renominate him and\nhe was elected.\nAnother argument sometimes heard\nis:  What service in return for the\nprivilege of the ballot would women\nbestow upon the state?  Would they\ndo jury duty?  Could they be judges?\nCould they give military service, or\nbe police-women, or fire-women?\nLet us take up these one after another:\nAs for jury duty, I maintain\nthat at present many a woman on\ntrial has a verdict rendered against\nher which is unjust because she has\nnot been tried by her peers.  Many\ncases come up in court, which are\npalpably beyond the comprehension\nand judgment of men.  Suits brought\nby dressmakers and staymakers,\nwhen their clients claim that the\ndresses or stays have been ruined,\nare misfits and cannot be worn, and\nthey refuse to pay for them.  Is it\nnot the height of absurdity for men\nto render a decision in these cases?  I\nwas present at the trial of the suit\nbrought by Mrs. Stanton Blatch\nagainst the manager of one of the\nleading hotels in our city for refusing\nto serve her and a friend with dinner,\nbecause they had no gentleman escort\nwith them.  The jurors were apparently\nall middle class, coarse men\nwho looked absolutely incapable of\nunderstanding what a sensitive woman's\nfeelings might be when turned\nout of a restaurant, after she had been\nseated at a table and after she had\ntaken pains to make inquiries at the\noffice as to whether she could be\nserved.  The Judge charged the jury\nnot to be influenced by the fact that\nthe plaintiff was a woman, and told\nthem that they were to consider the\ncase in the same light as though the", "73", 114, 114, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00389", "72\n\nplaintiff was a man, they were not to\nthink of her sex at all!  And yet the\nJudge knew perfectly well that the\nwhole case rested on the fact that because\nshe was a woman she was\nturned out of the restaurant, and that\nhad she been a man she would have \nbeen served!  Of course the verdict\nwas in favor of the defendant!\nAs for women being judges, why\nnot?  Women are admitted to the\nbar, and if any woman lawyer became\nsufficiently well known and acquired\na reputation for wisdom which would\nlead the people to elect them as \njudges, why not?  Even in the Biblical\ndays there were women judges\nwhose reputation for learning and\nwisdom has come down through the\ncenturies.\nThen as to the statement that\nwomen can't fight, and that only \nthose who can take up arms in\ndefense of their country should be\nallowed to vote, let me say, first of\nall, women can fight when they \nconsider it necessary (of course,\nwomen's natural weapons are women's\ntongues and women's clubs); but\nwhen it seemed to be their duty to\nwield more warlike weapons they\nhave taken up bayonets and earned\nhonor and glory.  It is not generally\nknown that, during our Civil War, it\nwas estimated that over four hundred\nenlisted in the Union army and that \na large number fought on the Confederate\nside.  It was stated at one\ntime that there were one hundred and\nfifty women in the Army of the\nPotomac alone.  It seems strange\nthat so many women should have\nbeen permitted to join the army, but\nin 1864 the ranks had been depleted\nby sickness and by those wounded in\nthe hard-fought battles, and recruits\nwere scarce and officials were no\ndoubt lax in examining them.  The\nSt. Petersburg census pointed out\nthat among the soldiers and subalterns\nthere were nearly 10,000 (9,975)\nwomen.  History also tells us that\n5,000 women enlisted under the\nbanners of Boadicea and fought,\nmany of them as bravely as the men.\nThe first crusading armies commanded\nby Peter, the Hermit, in the 11th\ncentury, contained nearly as many\nwomen as men and they fought with\nequal bravery and success.  In the\nrecent Russo-Japanese War there\nwere found to be a large number of\nwomen among the Japanese soldiers\nI could cite a number of instances\ndid time permit, of women who for\nmany years passed themselves off\nas men, and received honors and\nmedals for bravery.  But what is the\nuse?  IN these days of International\nand National Peace Congresses it is\nconceded that war is barbarous and\nunnecessary.  In olden days men\nwere called upon to defend their\nwalled-in cities at the point of the\nbayonet, and they naturally felt that\nonly those who could thus defend it\nwere entitled to the privileges of\ncitizenship; but to day our cities are\nnot walled, our foes are not without\nthe gates trying to scale the walls.\nThe enemies are within; they are\nindeed often sitting in high places.\nTo-day citizens are called upon to\nfight, not warriors, but vice and corruption\nand low standards.  Are not\nour mothers quite as capable as our\nfathers or brothers or our sons to\nwarfare against these, our enemies in\nour midst?  Besides, even in times of\nwar, the women who nurse the sick\nand wounded do just as valuable\nwork for their country as the men\nwho go out on the battlefields.\nAs for women not being able to\nserve in the police and fire departments,\nlet me point out that women\nserve as detectives and as police\nmatrons and cold hold certain positions\nin regard to the moral supervision\nof the city, the suppression of\ngambling, etc.  As for their ability\nto protect from fire, they have saved\nmany a man from being consumed by\nfire-after death!\nIn cities and towns of the third\nclass women taxpayers are permitted\nto vote on all questions affecting\ntheir property, but why this privilege\nis withheld from them when their\nproperty happens to be in the cities\nof the first class and is still more\nvaluable, remains to be explained by \n\n73\n\nman with his superior logic.  the\nidea of bestowing the franchise upon\ntax-paying women only is absurd,\nsince all women are taxpayers. \nManufacturers and merchants never\npay their taxes, they make the consumers\npay them, and therefore\nevery one of us is a taxpayer.\nWomen being the spenders of the\nhousehold are the largest consumers,\nand therefore the largest taxpayers.\nThere are between five and six\nmillion women wage earners in our\ncountry (not including all the women\nwho do household work, who earn\nwages but don't receive them), and\nthese women are not only interested\nin industrial legislation, and are consumers\nand taxpayers, but are also\ncontributing to the wealth of the\ncountry as producers, and yet they\nare denied the right of saying under\nwhat conditions they wish to work.\nIn olden days women were believed\nnot to possess souls.  The Chinese\nancestor worship was a worship of\nmale ancestors only-the women not\nhaving souls, could not be immortal.\nThen we were told that women had\nno brains, and that is why schools\nand colleges were considered necessary\nfor boys, but were deemed out of\nthe question for girls.  Even to-day\na newspaper as prominent as the\nNew York Times, which poses as an\nup-to-date, progressive paper, sees\nfit to print in its columns silly letters\nfrom correspondents trying to show\nthat women are absolutely devoid of\n\nbrains.  Such a representative and\nintelligent man as Professor Thwing\nof the Northwestern University claims\nthat women's brains are not inferior\nto men's.\nLotze, the metaphysician, says:\n\"It is hardly possible to distinguish\nbetween the higher mental life of\nmen and women.  I do not believe\nthat the intellectual capacity differs,\nexcept in so far as the special emotional\ninterests of each have prescribed\nthe course of their intellectual life.\nThere is, perhaps, no subject which\nwoman's mind could not understand.\"\nAs for the statement that women\nhave no hearts-that has been made\nby men from time immemorial-I\nadmit that many women have lost\ntheir hearts-to the men.  So, if\nwomen have no souls, no brains, no\nhearts, they must be mere machines,\nand I still assert that in a country\nwhere politics are utterly controlled\nby the machines, there remains no\nexcuse for withholding the franchise\nfrom the woman machines!\nLet this anniversary meeting be\nthe stimulus for our renewed energy\nto obtain the franchise for our sex in\nthis country.  Such a result would\nbe the most fitting monument we\ncould erect to the memory of that\nnoble, gifted women who, with undaunted\ncourage, sought to enfranchise\nher sex.

Church, acknowledged my father as his son,\nAlthough slave-holding fathers of colored children did not do this everyday \nin the week, it happened much more frequently than is generally supposed.\nA few years ago Birthright, a novel, was published serially in the Century magazine. \nThe hero of it was a colored man who had graduated from Harvard. He was\nborn and reared in a wretched, little southern town and had been sent to Cambridge, Massachusetts by his mother, a poor, ignorant, old woman, because a \ntypical southern\"colonel\", who was a Harvard graduate himself, wanted her to do\nso.    From the facts presented in this novel anybody who knew anything at all\nabout conditions in the South could see very clearly that the old \"colonel' was\nthis colored boy's father.\n            I made this statement to Mr. Glenn Frank, who was then editor of the\nCentury, when I called on him to talk with him about the book. Mr. Frank admitted \nthat in the original manuscript the author of Birthright had so represented\n this relationship between the two men. He had decided to omit that fact \n  in the Century, he said, because some southern men on the magazine staff had protested vigorously against having it appear, on the ground that no southern\nwhite man would acknowledge that he was the father of a colored child. This is \nbut one of the many illustrations of the fact that some southern editors on\nnorthern publications either do not know their South or deliberately misrepresent \nthe facts, when it pleases them to do so.\nLong before slaves were emancipated it was no uncommon thing for colored boys \nand girls to be sent to Europe by their masters who were also their fathers, \nbut who loved their children born of a slave mother too fondly to allow them to\nremain in the United States where they would have to bear the hard and humiliating \nlot of the slave.   These children were educated and most of them married \nabroad and their descendants are living there to day, not dreaming they have \nAfrican blood in their veins.\n          But, even if my father's master had not acknowledged him to be his son,\n anybody who used his eyes and saw the two men together could plainly see that\nthis was the relationship between them.

There was no state, no section which was absolutely\nfree from the contamination of this traffic in human\nsouls.  Wherever she turned, the serpent had left its trail,\ntil even the Church of God was poisoned with its sting.  In\nthe North, which professed abhorence of slavery and sympathy\nwith the slave, poor fugitives were hunted down and thrust\nback into bondage by law.  Even the Christian Church uttered\nno protest against enactments which made it a crime to teach\nmen and women to read the word of God.  In the pulpit\nministers of the gospel defended an institution which could\nwith impunity separate man from wife, tear mother from\nchild and whip to death servants whom angry masters cared\nto destroy.  Against this system of legalized prostitution\nwhose largest profits were frequently made from the sale of\nbeautiful colored girls for purposes too vile to mention, these\nservants of the Most High God refused to raise their voice.\nNay, even more, so low was the banner of Christ trailed in\nthe dust that there were pastors who refused to pray in their\npulpits for slaves.  So dead was the conscience, so hard was\nthe heart, so corrupt the morals of the country, when Harriet\nBeecher Stowe shook the battlements of sin.\nHeart-rending stories of the cruelties incident to slavery\nreached here ears every day.  Thousands of poor slave\nmothers she knew were mourning and could not be comforted,\nbecause their children were sold away.  Should she, a Christian\nwoman, look upon these atrocities without a protest or\nplea?  And yet, the more she saw how gigantic the evil and\nhow powerless she was to crush it, the more insane seemed\nany effort she might put forth against it.  But to men who\ncould do nothing, acquire nothing, possess nothing except what\ngrasping masters might claim, she longed to bring the light\nof knowledge and the blessing of freedom.\nBut what could she do?  She, a woman, poor in pocket,\nfeeble in health and burdened with heavy domestic cares of\nwhich a conscientious, loving mother would not and could\nnot be relieved?  From the body politic how could she cut\nthis cancer, whose roots and spread so far that every fibre\nand muscle was tainted?  To what purpose would she raise \n10\n\nher puny arm against an institution which was daily growing\nstronger in the South and becoming less hateful in the North?\nHow vain the hope of destroying slavery which by trade, by\nfamily ties and political expediency had tempted even its\nformer enemies into a shameful complicity !\nSubjected to the cold test of logic, any effort to wash this\nstain from the country's honor was futile and wild.  To a\nsoul less courageous, less responsive to the call of duty, less\ntouched by the sorrows of her fellow man than was this great-hearted\nChristian woman, it would indeed have been madness\nto dream of righting this prodigious wrong.  But, to\nHarriet Beecher Stowe, filled as she was with a sublime trust\nin God, animated by a strong desire to fulfill the mission to\nwhich she felt divinely called, obedience to the dictates of\nconscience was the most natural thing in the would.  And so,\nwith the determination to open the eyes of the blind, to touch\nthe hearts of the wicked, and arouse the conscience of those\nwho were indifferent to the woes and the degradation of the\nslave Harriet Beecher Stowe seized her pen in defense of\nhuman rights.  In all her life so devoted to the call of duty,\nso abundantly filled with acts of heroism and love, nothing\nshows more forcibly the intrepid spirit and the exalted character\nof Harriet Beecher Stowe than the terrible earnestness\nand fearlessness with which slavery was attacked.\nProbably no one who has had a mission to fulful has ever\nbeen confronted by more obstacles than was the author of\nUncle Tom's Cabin.  As the mother of a large family of\nchildren, who were delicate in health, nervous and excitable,\nshe questioned seriously whether it was right for her to\ndevote any of her time to literary efforts.  In her home her\nheart was centered, and while she yearned to extend her\ninfluence over a wider sphere, she felt as all true women do,\nthat her first duty was at her own fireside.  No one will\never know how torn with conflicting emotions was this faithful\nwife and loving mother, as she tried to decide where duty\nto her own little flock ended, and indifference to the public\nweal began.  To increase the difficulty of the situation, at\ntimes she doubted seriously that she would be successful as\na literary woman, although from her childhood she had displayed\nmarked ability in that direction.

This is the third effort thus to invite attention\nto what the Negro has thought and felt and attempted and accomplished.\nIt has gradually tended to find its way into all parts of the country where\npersons have manifested an intelligent interest in the promotion of the whole\ntruth.  Your cooperation in this significant undertaking is most earnestly\nsolicited.\n          We desire to disabuse any one's mind of the thought that this effort\nmeans the dimunition of interest in general history.  The purpose is not to \nsuggest less attention to the achievements of other races or nations but\nrather to give the Negro his place among them.  Any tendency to eulogize the\nNegro unduly or to leave the impression that the race has done more than some\nother group that has done its best would be decidedly unwise.  The purpose of\nthis celebration is to disabuse the public mind of this very sort of bias.\nThe record of the Negro is well taken care of if the race  is given the same\nconsideration which is accorded to the others.\n      In this celebration, we are urging that certain definite steps be \ntaken.  Ask your school authorities to adopt text-books treating Negro Life\nand History and organize classes and clubs for the serious study of the significant\nrecord of the race.  The Home Study Department has been established to\nassist such students in offering them instruction by mail.  Books to facilitate\nthe study of the Negro should be purchased for your library or school by\nraising the required sum on a day of Negro History Week set aside as the Book\nand Picture Fund Day.  In every large city, or at least in one of the large\ntowns of each State, there should be organized a branch of the Association to\nassist the national office in finding and sending to the archives of the Association\nsuch source materials of Negro history as letters, diaries and\nfamily records.  Every seeker after the whole truth should be a member of the\nAssociation.  The Negro History Week circular gives instructions as to\nprocedure.\nRespectfully yours,\nC G Woodson\nC. G.

I always am.  I certainly forgot to tell you about the date of finishing my course I thought that I had.  Graduation is the 22nd. of May and I may or may not recieve\nmy degree at that time. How ever I will assure them that I will\nstay and by so doing recieve it at the end of the summer term, in either case it would be merely apparent and I would not really get it until the end of the Fall term which will be about the fifth of December next. A greater portion of that Fall term's work, I will get out this comming by examinations and special work, I have allready gotten out some of it this term by examinations. That reminds me that I have the pleasure of nine examinations next week or maybe ten if I can show the registrar a deep point. Of course only a part of these examinations are for this terms work and some are for next Fall's work. At any rate I will be considerably ahead of the game by the end of the Summer's term. A recent letter from Laurie tells me that there are twenty five men between myself and the draft call. This will sound to much nearer than it really is the reason being that in such a sparsely settled locality a single man is the equivalent of many hundred back east. This being so the only thing that determines when I would be called would the amount that will be called so that my 25 out there is equal as I say to many hundred here. It would seem though that at four a month I would be safe enough for this terms work and perhaps a better part of the\nnext terms too. I say four a month when in fact the average called so far has been but three men a month. It would seem then as if I would have time enough to make unless of course such facilities for training the men would be installed that they could call in a lots quicker than they can now.\nThe weather here is splendid and with the 'earlier' time I certainly find it a hard matter to stay in the house long enough to study. There is the prettiest little lake about a half mile from here and now I almost can't stay away from it. How ever I hope to have some good marks this term even so. I have not been studying as hard as I did last term but I will make the term and with some to spare.\nMany thanks for the advancement, it will certainly help a lot. If I recieve it anytime between the fifteenth and twentieth it will be allright. And by the way if you send a bank draft or an express draft it will only cost about a nickle. A money order or personal check will cost at least a quarter and the check takes ten days for collection. That is certainly kind of you Mother. I will return it with good interest. Understand 'interest' to have a double meaning.\nWell my time is about up and I must get out to a class. But it is so pretty outside that I'd rather go out to the lake and fish but I suppose I'll have to try someway to stay inside.\nLots of good wishes and again 'thanks'.

Be not discouraged because of race\nprejudice. The world will come to see that\nselfishness is wrong, whether of a race or\nan individual. Altruism is the new light\naround which the moths of prejudice will\nsinge their wings. The cry, \"Am I my\nbrother's keeper,\" was the cry of a murderer\nand the mean spirit which despises any\nkind of humanity now, black or white, is a\nrelic of the Cain spirit coming down to us\nthrough slavery and the fabric of feudalism.\nIt is a fetid, posthumous rancor exuding\n\nfrom the grave damps of the centuries.\n7.

In his comprehensive\nmessage, Mr. Roosevelt's genius and\nwide grasp of the present-day problems of\nthe nation and the world, stand forth quite\nconspicuously. The way he goes at the\ncomplex and vexing problems of the times\nand strikes out for real and vital reforms,\nstrikingly illustrates the great truth which\nLincoln uttered when he declared that\n\"Genius disdains a beaten path.\" Mr.\nRoosevelt is thoroughly original and surprisingly\nindependent. We can merely allude\nto the strong features of his message.\nHe begins the body of his message with a\ndiscussion of the relations of capital and labor,\ndealing specially with organized capital\nand labor. He considers this question as\nsecond only in our national life to that of\nthe family life. He reiterates the position\nhe has stated before, that he has no objection\nto either organized labor or organized\ncapital. In fact he is inclined to look\nfavorably upon both. In the case of capital,\nhe insists that the business shall be\nhonest and legitimate and that the Federal\ngovernment shall exercise proper supervision.\nWhile he admires the main motive of\nlabor unions, he discountenances the mob\nviolence that the unions have at times resorted\nto in order to enforce their demands.\nUnion men have a right to quit work and\nto demand higher wages, but they have no\nright whatever to molest or coerce others\nwho want to work. In dealing with the\ntrusts, the President thinks that we ought\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW\n\n651\n\nto go about to remedy the evils with \"a\nquiet determination to proceed step by step,\nwithout halt and without hurry.\" The\nusual recommendations are made in an original\nway as regards agriculture, irrigation,\nforest reserves and the Indians. He enumerates\nthe benefits of the rural free delivery,\nencourages legitimate and high class\nimmigration, by emphatically condemns\nthe fraudulent naturalization methods now\nobtaining in some parts of this country. In\nsome parts of this country a foreigner can\nbe made into an American citizen while he \nwaits. He says that the Phillippine Islands\nare totally unfit for self-government at\n\nWILLIAM CULLEN BRYANT\nAn American Poet Who Was Heartily Opposed to Slavery\n\npresent and thinks that our ant-imperalists\nmake a blunder in continually agitating\nthe question of independence. What they\nneed now is moral, religious, educational\nand material development. Later he hopes\nto see them sustain almost the same relations\nto us as Cuba now sustains. He discusses\nthe present railway rates and recommends\nsome reforms. Among them is his\ncondemnation of the unjust rebate system.\nProbably the most interesting part of his\nmessage is that which deals with our foreign\npolicy.

To reduce the South's representation\nand accept that as ample compensation\nfor Negro disfranchisement would\nmean a virtual surrender of the Fifteenth\nAmendment to the constitution. Thus\ncongress would set its stamp of approval\nupon southern disfranchisement. We admire\nGeneral Keifer and Mr. Crumpacker.\nIf there were more men of their kind in\ncongress a way would be found where every\nman could be assured a right to cast an\nhonest ballot. Our disfranchising laws\nmust be overturned. They are unconstitutional\nand unjust. But we shy at reduction\nof southern representation as the proper\nremedy. The fact is, congress ought to refuse\nto seat any congressmen from a State\nwith disfranchising laws. State conventions\nwould be called this very winter and state\nconstitutions would be formed in keeping\nwith the constitution of the United States.\n\nSenator Bacon and\nWhite Supremacy\n\nReaders of the VOICE\nwill remember what a\npitiful plea United\nStates Senator Bacon put up before a Chicago\naudience during the presidential campaign.\nThen, he said, the South felt as\noutcasts of the nation. He made it appear\nin Chicago that the South would feel so dejected\nat the election of President Roosevelt\nthat half of our southern white people\nwould feel like committing suicide. Mr.\nRoosevelt was elected - not by a narrow,\nstingy majority, but by the most emphatic\nmajority every received by a candidate for\nthe presidency. The politicians and partisan\nnewspapers had misrepresented the\npresident to the people. The white people\nin the South thought that Mr. Roosevelt\nwas universally disliked. His overwhelming\nelection opened their eyes. The after-\nelection wail that Senator Bacon had prophecied\ndid not materialize. Instead of the\nSouth being downcast, the South is glad\nthat Parker and Davis went down. The\nleading business men here in Atlanta have\nsaid as much in newspaper interviews.\nSome of our white men have ventured to\nsay that the campaign of slander conducted\nby the Democrats and the Negro question\ndefeated the party. Julius Brown, a rich\nman of Atlanta, and the son of a former\ndemocratic governor of our state, has written\na letter to the press asking that the\nDemocrats make the election of Roosevelt\nunanimous. So there seems to be no wailing\nhere, save among the politicians. This\nis not to Senator Bacon's liking, for his\nprophecy falls flat. The people appear to\nbe too happy and prosperous and too forgetful\nof that everlasting bogie, Negro\ndomination. Consequently, about the first\nof December Mr. Bacon came out in a long\nletter of cheap political tommyrot about\n\"White Supremacy.\" He claims a monopoly\nof virtue for the southern white\nman. He warns the South to beware of\nthe Greeks - meaning, of course, the men\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW   661\n\nwho have sense enough to appreciate peace\nand fair government for both races. The\nrace problem will be the chief issue in the\nSouth as long as the southern people elect\nto high positions her little politicians. Only\nstatesmen can help us out of our present\nunhappy condition. It is time the South\nceased to put such little men as Mr. Bacon\nin such big places.\n\nA Lesson from John\nSharp Williams\n\nIn a speech at Spartanburg,\nS.C., on\nDecember 2nd, John\nSharp Williams, of Mississippi, said some\nreally commendable things. It will be recalled\nthat Mr. Williams is the present \nleader of the minority party in congress.\nMr. Williams attributed the recent democratic\ndefeat to four principal causes:\n\n1. The present business prosperity was\nagainst the Democrats.\n\n2. The South's inhumanity to the Negro\nawoke the abolition spirit in the North.\n\n3. The personal popularity of Mr. Roosevelt.\n\n4. The Statesboro savagery.\n\nMr. Williams was not far wrong in this\nspeech. If the whole South has learned\nthese lessons by the astounding election\nfigures, it has learned a valuable lesson.\nAnd there are a great many reasons for believing\nthat the South is coming to her\nsenses. Not a single lynching occurred\nduring the month of November. The Chicago\nTribune says that last month was the\nfirst month in which we have not had a\nlynching since 1885. Who can tell but\nthat this is the direct result of President\nRoosevelt's attitude towards lynchings?\nHis election by such a tremendous majority\ndumbfounded the lynchers, for they saw\nthat the American people were against this\nway of doing things. But the lesson we\nstopped to call attention to in Mr. Williams'\nspeech is a lesson many of our people\nhave yet to learn. Mr. Williams had\njust said some very frank things to his\n\nrace. Then he gave utterances to these\nsignificant sentences:\n\n\"The words that I am uttering here I would not\nutter to any but a southern audience. I would\nsink deeper and lower than a plummet could sound\nbefore I shall ever reprove the shortcomings of my\npeople to an audience of their enemies, or to an\naudience, whether enemies or not, who are not\ncharged with the control of our domestic affairs.\"\n\nSome of our own leaders need to take\nthis white man's attitude home to themselves.\nHere is a representative white man\nwho abhors wrong in his people and says\nso to his people; but he sees no sense nor\nreason in saying these same things to a\nnorthern audience. Certain of our representative\nmen delight in parading the Negro's\nfaults before the white man, both\nNorth and South. They do it ostentatiously\nfor the purpose of being frank, but\nin reality, they seek personal favors from\nthe whites. They can, by doing this, get\nmoney to support whatever institutions\nthey may be connected with and press notoriety,\nand generally that is what they are\nafter. They, themselves, are benefitted and\ntheir institutions are helped, but the great\nNegro race is wronged. Altho these leaders\nignore many fundamentals, they shape\nsentiment - they furnish the world its estimate\nof us; for, be it remembered that only\nmen who utter criticisms of the race, get\nwide publicity. Criticise the race? Yes,\nbut do not be a blab-mouth telling our\nfaults to all the world. Criticise the race\nto the race.\n\nThe Congregational\nNational Council\n\nThe twentieth session\nof the Triennial\nNational Council of \nthe Congregationalists of the United States\nheld recently at Des Moines, Iowa,\nwas one of the most important religious\ngatherings of the year, and the best meeting\nin the history of that denomination.\nThe Congregationalists are strongest\nin the East, but are expanding in the", "13", 123, 123, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-002:00601", "9\nwas the section of the \ncountry to put a quietus \non him etc.\nMrs. Gibson's little \nMollie told me about \nthe \"two-step\" she \nhad with Phyllis \nat Gladys Booker's party.\nGive my love to all.\nYour devoted sister,\nLaura", "6", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00025", "672                 THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO \n\nbuildings, 151 officers and instructors, an endowment \nfund of $1,030,553, and that its receipts \nfor the year were over $200,000. \nThere is no college for whites in Alabama, \nGeorgia, South Carolina, Mississippi, or \nArkansas which has had so much done for \nit. It is one of may, albeit the richest \nperhaps. The Southern whites have raised \nlarge sums for the common-school education \nof the Negro by taxing themselves, for \nthe whites pay most of the taxes in the \nSouth. \n\nThese facts should assure the Negro of \nthe friendship of the white man for him, \nand they more than offset any argument to \nthe contrary drawn from acts of violence \nby a small majority of the prejudiced and \nlawless. The best white people, North and\nSouth, wish the Negro to have a fair chance \nto be and to do the best for himself. \n\n(1) Now I have some words of advice, \nand the first is this: Let the Negro think \nmore of his duties and less of his rights. \nIn the United States all the people, white \nand black, think twice of their rights where \nthey think one of their duties. Yet no \nman and no race ever did much until it \nwas absorbed in duty. And duty done, \nalways in the end, secures to all of us, all \nthe real rights we are entitled to. Every \nman has the right to do right, and there is \nno nobler right than that. \n\n(2) Let the Negro be himself and not \nsomebody else. No man and no race ever \ncomes to much who would rather be somebody \nelse than himself or itself. \n\nI was on a sleeping car a few nights ago \nand heard a man-a man from the North as \nit happened-criticizing the Negroes rather  \nsharply. I ventured to interpose a few \nwords of defense, and in the course of his \nreply he declared among other things that if \nhe should advertise a soap that would \nstraighten the hair and make white the skin \nof the Negroes he could sell tons of it every \nweek of the world. If what he said was \ntrue, it is not very promising for the Negro. \n\nIt shows he wants that self-respect for his \nrace which is necessary for the best interest \nof his people. Equally wanting in \nself-respect is the perpetual talk about what \nis called \"social equality\". God separates\nraces for good ends, and God's ends are best \naccomplished by every race respecting itself \ntoo much to wish to be any other. \n\nThe society which every race most needs \nis the best of its own, and when it breaks \naway from that, if its effort is at all successful, \nit only succeeds in mingling itself\nwith the worst society of the race it seeks \nto obtrude upon. No good can come to any \nrace by any such policy. \n\n(3) The presence and history of the Negro \nin American is too great a fact to be \nwithout significance in the plans of God \nfor the world. Africa has a claim on the \nchildren of Africa in the United States, and \nthat claim should be honored above all \nothers. The Christian religion and the civilization \nwhich it carries with it should be \ngiven to Africa, and the Negroes of America\nshould see that this is done shortly. \nWhat shall be said of a people which has \nreceived so much and refuses to give this \nmuch to its kindred beyond the sea?\n\nMay God bless the Negroes of my country \nand make them a blessing. \n\n---------\n\nTHINGS THAT NEVER DIE \nBy Charles Dickens \n\nThe memory of a clasping hand, \nThe pressure of a kiss, \nAnd all the trifles sweet and frail,\nThat make up love's first bliss: \nIf with a firm unchanging faith, \nAnd holy trust and high, \nThose hands have clasped, those lips have met-\nThese things shall never die. \n\nThe cruel and the bitter word,\nThat wounded as it feel; \nThe chilling want of sympathy \nWe feel, but never tell;\nThe hard repulse that chills the heart, \nWhose hopes were bounding high, \nIn an unfading record kept-\nThese things shall never die. \n\n\nThe Opportunity for an Object Lesson \nBy Rev.

Indeed \nI feel that there is hardly need that they be \ndifferent. Our interests are one. That \nwhich blesses and saves the white man \nblesses and saves the black man. \n\nNo doubt many of us feel that we have \ngrievances. The conditions which confront \nus seem forbidding. It is right that we \nshould consider how we may attain the \nhighest character, the truest success and the \nrichest usefulness. \n\nThe fault with most of the schemes proposed \nfor relief is that they are superficial. \nIf we would have the best advice we must \nturn to Jesus. \n\nThe conditions in our time are like Paradise \nas compared with the conditions in \nPalestine about A. D. 30, when Jesus began \nhis public teaching. When the French \nrevolution came the French peasants were \npaying $11 in taxes out of every $13 earned \nand taxes were levied with less justice in \nPalestine. Mark Anthony had given the \ncustoms receipts of Jericho to the Egyptian \nharlot, Cleopatra, and the publicans who \nfarmed the taxed oppressed the people without \nmercy. \n\nFortunes, proportionately vastly larger \nthan the wealth of the Astors and Vanderbilts \nof today, were piled up at the expense \nof thousands of starvelings. \n\nTiberius of Rome dealt out offices with \na degree of favoritism and selfish villainy\nthat Dick Croker would scorn to be guilty \nof. There was no ballot, no popular election. \nThere was not even the semblance of religious \nliberty. To think was to risk life. \nThe hordes of unemployed filled the marketplaces, \nbut found no employers. Millions \nwent to bed hungry every night. \n\nThe piety, the patriotism and the pockets\nof the Jews had been outraged. Some of \nthe more daring and desperate, like Barabbas, \nhad taken to highway robbery and murder. \n\nUpon such a scene, whose hard lines we \ncannot even imagine, Jesus came. Thousands \nof eyes turned to Him, as thousands \nof eyes turned to Mirabeau in France or \nthousands of other eyes turned to Joseph \nArch in England. \n\nNow look at Jesus as He sees the conditions, \nfeels the yoke and opens is mouth \nto teach. He was in full sympathy with \nthe working classes. He had served thirty \nyears at the carpenter's bench. He was in \nfull sympathy with the patriots. No Jew", "19", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00026", "674\n\nTHE VOICE OF THE NEGRO \n\nmore loyal or loving breathed the atmosphere \nof Judea. He was in full sympathy \nwith the spiritual reformers. Indeed, He \nwent beyond even the most ardent. \n\nBut listen to what He said. His platform \nof reformation is found in His great opening \naddress. In all the eight great planks\nof the platform He reiterates the principle, \nchange yourselves. Never once did He say\nchange your conditions, fight for your \nrights, resist the oppressor, raise a revolution. \nAlways His words were: \"Your \nconditions will be all right if you will get \nyourself right.\"\n  \nThey refused to listen to him. They \nraised the revolution. It brought ruin incomparably \nworse than that which it sought \nto remedy. When Titus marched back to \nRome from Jerusalem the sun of Jewish \nnational life had set forever. The tenth \nlegion marched through a forest of crosses \nupon every one of which hung a Jew. \n\nNo wonder Jews wept when they approached \nthe city of Jewish pride and saw \nthe impending peril. If they had only \nknown the things that made for peace, \nnamely, the childlike spirit, meekness, hunger \nand thirst for righteousness, mercy, \npurity of heart and gentleness, they had \nsaved themselves and their nation. So, I \nwould say to the white man today, do you\nfind your contact with the Negro unpleasant?\nThen change yourself; there is something \nwrong with you. And to the Negro \nI would say, do you find your association \nwith the white man unpleasant? Then, \nchange yourself; there is something wrong \nwith you. \n\nThe great question that each one of us \nshould ask himself is, \"How can I do the \ngreatest good to the greatest number, regardless \nof how I am appreciated?\" \"How \ncan I be a benefactor not only to my own \nrace, but more magnanimously to all men?\"\n\"How can I bring the kingdom of peace \nand good will to pass on earth?\"\n\nAny man, white or black, who will      \nanswer that question candidly, sincerely, honestly, \nwill find that the race problem has \nlost its color and has grown dim in the light \nof a glorious opportunity to save humanity. \nNo two races in the history of the world \nhave had such an opportunity for mutual forbearance, \nsympathy, service and blessing as \nthe whites and blacks in the South. In \nGod's name let us give an object lesson of \nChristianity to the world!\n\nIt is a great pity that a few bad men of \nthe white race and an equally small number \nof the black race should be by their misconduct \nand mouthings embitter a million good \npeople of both races. For one I am determined \nthat they shall not do it. It is as \nunreasonable, for me to hate all Negroes \nbecause of the crimes of a few as it would \nbe for me to blow up the Chinese empire \nwith dynamite because a Chinese laundryman \nstole my collars.        \n\nLet us not confuse the individual with \nthe race, but put character above color and \nprinciple above pigment cells. Let each \nindividual determine to deserve the good \nwill of the other race. \n\nI do not know anything that would go \nfarther towards making the peace and prosperity \nof our section that that we should \nfall in love with our jobs. Dignify your \nwork. No man ever did a good job that \nfelt that the work he was doing was beneath \nhim. Is the work in which you are engaged \nworth while? Does it need to be done? Does \nthe welfare of society depend upon it? If it \ndoes, then you can afford to put your heart \nin it. Do not shirk your duty. Do not \nscamp your task. We have some very \nfalse distinctions in our country as to what \nis dignified labor and what is not. Some of\nus imagine that only preaching, and teaching, \nand practicing law and medicine are \ndignified callings. But if one will get the \nright idea of work, these distinctions will \ndisappear.

He ministers to \nthe physical and aesthetic welfare of society.       \nHe is a public servant. If he puts his heart \ninto it, he is a servant of God. \n\nThere were two carts passing down the \nstreet one day. On the seat of the one sat \na man with sullen visage and gruff voice. \nHe seemed out of sorts with the whole \nworld. He was driving a cart to the bone \nyard and despised his job. Behind him, \nthere came a second cart, upon the seat of \nwhich sat a driver, with sparkling eyes and \nbeaming face and cheery voice. He also had\na load of bones. But the second man was \nnot going to the bone yard. He was taking \nhis bones to a museum where he expected \nto reconstruct the skeleton of an extinct animal.\nHe was happy. His heart was in \nhis job. What was the difference in the \ntwo men? The first man had a more important \ntask than the second but he despised \nit. The second had put his heart, his soul, \ninto his task and thereby glorified it. You \ncan do the same with your own. Do you \ncook? Then, do your best to make the \nmost skillful cook in town. Do you drive \na garbage cart? Then, take pains to have \nthe cleanest route in town.

L. D. \n\nThe editors of THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO \nhave asked me for \"a message to the \nNegro race of the twentieth century.\" I\ndo not know that I have any special message \nfor the Negro other than what I would \ngive, had I the right, to any other race. I \nam not in the habit of segregating races. \nI suppose the Lord deals with individuals \nand I prefer to do the same; further I do not \nknow that there is a separate Negro race in \nthis country, inasmuch as the gradation is \nso close between our various races. I suppose \nI understand, however, what is meant, \nand that by the Negro race it is meant to include \na multitude who are as much Caucasian \nas they are Negro, or even more. It \nis those who have been driven into what\nmay be called caste to whom you invite me \nto speak. \n\nAnd first: \"What I say unto you I say \nunto all,\" and what needs to be said over \nand over again - develop as far as possible \nthe self-respecting element among the peo-\n\nWENDELL PHILLIPS \nHe was a Staunch Leader in the Abolition Movement.

This must be done by \neducation, by religion, by industry and \neconomy. Character tells, money talks. \nSteady industry and honest life are sure in \nthe end to gain recognition. \n\nSecond: I fear that the colored people \nof culture and education in the great work\nto develop themselves and to lift up the ignorant\nmembers of their class by missions, \nschools, etc., have not found time to give \nproper attention to the control and suppression \nof the more irresponsible and worthless \nmembers of their caste. These are the \nones that discredit the entire body.\nThere should be an influence exerted which \nwould be a very strong moral, if not physical, \nforce to close up the nests of depravity, \nwhich are to be found among colored people, \nespecially in the cities. They should \nbe regarded as the enemies of the race, the \nworst enemies they have. There is required \na pretty forceful sort of mission work among \nthem. I do not know how this is to be \ndone, but I think it can be largely done \nthrough the influence of preachers, churches, \nteachers and leaders generally. Dives and \ndrinking places should be cleaned out and \nmeans used to support the law, and where \nthe law is ineffective to make it effective. \n\nThird: The colored people of intelligence \nshould steadily resist, so far as can be done \nwithout too much offense, all infractions on \ntheir legal rights and laws which limit their \nequal civil rights. They cannot forcibly \nclaim equal privileges where laws forbid it, \nbut just so far as the letter of the law allows \nthey should claim the right to be registered \nand to vote, and they should press the matter \nthat they secure honest registration. \nEvery Negro that has the right to vote \nshould seek the privilege of voting, and not \nbe deterred by the expense of the poll tax \nor the trouble of securing his privilege. If \nhis legal rights are denied him he should \nrepeat the demand at every opportunity, \nand use all his influence to see that proper \nregistrars are appointed.

KELLY MILLER\n\nThe salvation of any overshadowed race \nwill depend upon what they are rather than \nwhat they do, upon character more than \nenterprise, upon endurance rather than endeavor. \nFor the Negro race I regard the \ndevelopment of the moral nature as fundamental \nand supreme. My advice to the \nNegro would be: \n\n1. Follow virtue, act righteously, observe \nthe ten commandments, obey the law of \nthe land and of the community where you \nlive. Nothing but robust moral integrity \ncan preserve a weak race in contact with a \nstrong one. The value of virtue is absolute. \nHonesty, truthfulness, fidelity, chastity \nand sobriety can never fail of universal \nrecognition and reward. They are worth \njust as much to the simple as to the wise, \nto the rich as to the poor, to the black as \nto the white. We need never despair of \nthe destiny of any people whose feet are \ntenoned and mortised in the granite foundation \nof truth and righteousness. On the \nother hand, if they forget the moral element, \nhowever showy may be their gifts \nand attainments, we have only to put our\nears to the ground to hear \"the muffled \ndrum of fate, beating their funeral marches to the grave.\"\n\n2. Exemplify the Christian religion. \nGod has endowed you with meekness, humility\nand forgiveness of spirit. Are you \nnot the most striking illustration of that \nbeatitude with a promise - \"Blessed are \nthe meek for they shall inherit the earth?\"\nYou are here, in this western hemisphere, \nsome twenty million strong, and are sure \nto inherit all that Aryan civilization contains. \nThe red Indian struck back, but he \nstrikes no more. He was been dispatched \nto the \"Island of the Blessed,\" where all \nfeeble races will speedily go who, like Job's \nwife, dare curse the white God and die. \nThose that suffer and are overborne have \nalways moral and spiritual advantage over \ntheir haughty oppressors. Reforms come \nfrom those who suffer and feel the need of \nthem. Who knows but that you have been \nplaced here to bring an arrogant world back \nto the simple teachings of the son of God?\nThe Anglo-Saxon is pitiable deficient in \nessential Christian graces. He never turns \nthe other cheek except as a maneuver to \nsmite the finishing blow. Humility and \nlowliness of spirit are alien to his nature. \nHis god is power - his religion is gain. \nDid not your illiterate forbears, with clear \nspiritual discernment, say to the rapacious \nwhite lord of creation, \"You may have all \nthe world, but give me Jesus?\" The white \nman is bound to get the world, whether \nyou consent or not. But he has no monopoly \nof spiritual gifts. The Negro is \nmore apt to win in the race that is set before \nhim by following the precepts of Jesus \nthan by joining the great white throng that \nbows down and worships at the shrine of \nthe Almighty Dollar. \n3. Cultivate self respect. You should \nnever accept the low estimate and spiteful\n\nA WORD TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY NEGRO           679\n\ntreatment that evil men bestow upon you \nas a just measure of your inherent worth. \nYou are as sheep among wolves. Do not \ntry conclusions with the wolf, but at the \nsame time do not let him overawe and \ncower your spirit. The spirit in modern \ncivilization would ever and anon impress\nthe Negro with a sense of his inferiority. \nBe not so impressed. Those who are really \nsuperior are least likely to make obtrusive \ndisplay of their advantage. Present a manly \nattitude amid a brutal and outrageous \ndisplay of power. Preserve that inner freedom \nwhich ridicule, insult and cruel rebuff \ncannot reach. Do not be carried away by   \na swaggering and boastful optimism that is \nborn of ignorance and sometimes, I fear, \nfostered by crafty design to deceive and \nmislead the simple. It is folly to imitate \nthe savage who, drunk with the war-dance, \ntemeriously faces modern artillery with \nhis little bow and arrow. The development \nof ten centuries is more than that of forty \nyears. The Negro belongs to a backward \nor belated race. If the Negro race is in its \nchildhood, as Dr. Washington would say, \nthe white race may be in its dotage. The \nbackward class has not yet gained concrete \nequality of power. On the other hand, \neschew that wailful, inane pessimism despised \nby God and man. The pessimist \nhas never advanced this world one iota in \nthe scale of progress. Sanity is the middle \nground between exultant optimism, born of \nignorance, and supine pessimism, begotten \nof cowardice and fear. Protest in manly \nfashion against outrage and wrong. You \nmay be compelled to receive political and \ncivic unrighteousness, but do not accept it \nwith complaisant acquiescence. The sufferer   \nowes it to the oppressor, as well as to \nhimself, to protest against oppression. It \nis due the wrong-doer to know that his \ndeeds are iniquitous. \n\nCultivate at least a negative race pride. \nDo not despise your own race and color. Is \nthere any virtue in a white, black or yellow \ncuticle? They are all alike in the dark. It \nmakes no difference when we are asleep. Is \nknowledge, culture, or spiritual serenity an \nattribute of skin or the soul? In what \nsingle respect is the white race perfect?\nHave not the greatest evil-doers of the human  \nrace been of that color? To be like \nsomebody else is the low ambition of a little \nsoul. A noble nature strives to become its \nbest self, and to contribute to the sum total \nof human good whatever of worth with \nwhich it may be endowed. The world \nadores Moses and Homer and Shakespeare,\noblivious of the accident of race and color, \nbut because of the human soul touched \nwith divine fire. When approached as to \n\"social equality,\" say to the white interlocutor, \n\"I do not think that any colored \nman will dine at your table without an invitation, \nand as he thinks you would probably \n\nFREDERICK DOUGLAS \nThe Greatest Negro of modern times.

Be industrious. Buy lands and houses \nand accumulate material goods. Pool your \nsavings and start banks and stores and factories, \nso as to give colored boys and girls \nan opportunity in the highest lines of work. \nIf your work is of an humble grade, perform \nit with all the skill and character at \nyour command. Be faithful and diligent \nin little things. The material standard of \ncivilization is advancing. Teach your children \nto acquire skill and deftness, in or out \nof school, in whatever line of work their \nhands find to do. Cultivate your farm with \ndiligence and lay by your surplus earnings \nfor the rainy day. Educate your children. \nIt should be a disgrace to any parent to \nhave his child grow up in ignorance. But \ndo not put your trust in mammon. Mere \nmoney has never righted a wrong in all human \nhistory. The love of money is the \nroot, and not the remedy of evil. \n\n5. Covet the best gifts. Encourage \ntalent and genius to expand and exploit \nitself. Any race will be measured in the\nlong run by the illustrious names it has\nproduced, and not by its carpenters and \nbricklayers. Every boy should seek the \nhighest line of service that his faculties and \nopportunities can command. You need not \nfear a plethora of philosophers; there never \nwas a dearth of fools. Reprobate that \ncheap philosophy which would keep Frederick \nDouglas in the shipyard, J. C. Price \non the farm, Paul Lawrence Dunbar at the \nelevator ropes, and Booker T. Washington \nin the coal mines. The mere acquisition \nof bread and butter has never been the \naspiration of any people who have done \nanything worth while in the history of the \nhuman species. \n\n----------\n\nA Message to the Negro Race \nof the Twentieth Century \nBy W. H. Council\n\nOnly the man whose intelligential susceptibility \nsaw, in 1864, just forty years ago, \nthe beginning of the free life of the American \nNegro, can have anything like an adequate \nidea of the progress made by him. \nThis progress is all the more wonderful \nwhen it is recognized as the refulgent rays \nof the sun bursting from the blackness of\nnight without premonitory dawn. A glance\nover the gamut of the history of the human \nrace fails to reveal anything like it. I repeat, \nthat there is nothing in the life of any \nother race or people, from the dawn of history \nto the present day that is parallel to \nthe development of the Negro race in the \nSouthern States. How the Negro or his \nfriends, conversant wit the history of the Negro \nrace in America, can now become pessimistic \nof the Negro's future, is a problem that \ncannot be solved by men who have confidence \nin the accomplishment of pluck and \nenergy and faith in God. \n\nForty years ago, when a boy sixteen years \nof age, just out of slavery, I was not able \nto see a rift in the clouds, through which \nthe King of Day smiled. It was dark, \ndark, dark! Not a Negro school house of \nany pretention, except at Fortress Monroe \nand a few points within Federal lines, in all  \nthe land! As dark as the brow of midnight! \nAs black as the hinges of Hell! As black \nas the turbid current of Styx, so far as freedom\nand the great blessings which it would \nbring to the race were concerned!\n\n681\n\nA MESSAGE TO THE NEGRO RACE\n\nI looked abroad. I saw no Negro owner \nof the real estate; no Negro teachers, educated \npreachers; no lawyers, doctors, merchants, \nnor others engaged in the higher \nindustrial walks. \"But a change came over \nthe spirit of my dream.\" Now I look \nabroad over the land and I see the Negroes \nengaged in nearly every one of the more \nthan three hundred professions and occupations \nfollowed by the people of this country. \n\nIn 1851, a book known as \"Negro-Mania,\" \npublished by a John Campbell, asks \nthese questions: \"In fine, have the woolly-\nheaded races of men, ever produced one, \neven only one man, famous as either a law-giver, \nstatesman, poet, priest, painter, historian, \norator, architect, musician, soldier, \nengineer, navigator, astronomer, linguist, \nmathematician, anatomist or philosopher; \nif they have let us know his name, when \nhe was born and where he flourished, the \nworks he wrote and how, and when he died.\"\nPassing over the names of illustrious Negroes \nin all the past, which were unknown \nto that uninformed, prejudiced braggart, in \nforty years, the Negro race has produced \nmen to represent all out of the twenty-one \ncharacters for which he called: Frederick \nDouglas, and Langston, statesmen; A. A. \nWhitman, poet; Father Tolton, priest, and \nPayne and others; Edmonia Lewis, sculptor, \nand Tanner, painter; Geo. W. Williams, \nhistorian; Price, orator; Coleridge-\nTaylor, musician; Lobengula, soldier; \nScarborough and Blyden, linguists; D. H. \nWilliams physician; Bishop Turner, philosopher; \nand other who are becoming famous \nalong lines of thought then unknown \nto this interrogator. \n\nIn recent years, the opposition to Negro \ndevelopment and advancement has not been \nas sharp and discouraging as the let-alone \nprocess.

He \nhas come to the conclusion that his salvation \ndepends upon his own exertions. I think \nthat, no doubt, his realization of this fact, \nis the fruitful source of the powerful energies \nput forth and the heroic accomplishment \nby the young men of this decade. \n\nNever before in the history of the Negro \nrace has there been put forth in any race \nsuch efforts for the racial advancement, and \nnever before in the history of the race have \nwe had stronger embriotic forces which \nplainly indicate a manhood development \nthat will accept the racial defeat, and capable \nof surmounting all difficulties in and out \nof the race.

LANDRUM \n\nWhen I began to love the individual Negro \nI can not tell. Memory does not reach \nfarther back than the lap of my old black \nnurse, where I found myself in the long \nago, loved and loving with a deathless \naffection. If there were no other reason \nwhy I should be kind to Negroes, gratitude \nto a race that produced such a character \nwould be sufficient. It is usual with antebellum\nSouthern gentlemen, I know, to recall\nwith chivalrous regard their old nurses, \nwith their inexhaustible patience, gentleness \nand self-sacrifice. My commendation \nof mine is not conventional. She was indeed \na character of unusual strength, clear \nand unyielding in her moral convictions, \nand daily illustrating in her life the principles    \nshe taught the white and black children \nof the place. \n\n A MESSAGE OF FRIENDSHIP \n\n683\n\nIn my boyhood I taught a class in Sunday \nschool composed of Negro children. \nDuring the early years of my ministry, not \nlong after the Civil war, I was a voluntary \nand unpaid but enthusiastic professor in a \ndeveloping Negro college which is now \nlocated in Atlanta. More recently I have \nbeen president of the Home Mission Board \nof the Southern Baptist Convention, which\ncooperates with the National Baptist Convention \n(Negro) on terms of delightful \nharmony and absolute religious equality.\n\nWith such a record behind me I may be \nallowed to say that I desire always to \nbe numbered among my friends of my \n\"brother in black\". Nor am I presumptuous \nenough to claim superiority of affection \nover the great majority of the Christian \nministry. Never before within my recollection, \ncertainly never since the close of \nthe Civil War, was there so deep an interest \nin the welfare of the colored man on the   \npart of the Christians of the South, as there \nis today. The proofs are abundant and \nmost gratifying; and I wish to add that, \nin my judgment, no Southern man, Christian \nor unchristian, of logical mind and \nwide outlook, for a moment fears the bogy \nof political domination or social equality on \nthe part of the Negro. The politician's \ncry to that effect has fallen into innocuous     \ndesuetude. \n\nThe future of the Negro is as bright as \nthe promises of God. Let me send you \nthis word of cheer : Look up, not down;\nforward, not backward. Trust and do \nright, and all will be well. \n\n------\n\nJudge Speer on Even Handed Justice\n\nWe addressed a courteous letter to Judge \nEmory Speer of the United States Circuit \nCourt, asking for a message to the race. \nHis position on the equality of all citizens \nbefore the law, and his elevated and forceful \naddresses in favor of law and order and \nin favor of fair trial, make his words readable \nto the vast majority of right thinking  \nmen. We give below his letter explaining \nwhy he did not send the contribution in \ntime for this issue, and also excerpts from \nhis address for the grand jury at Savannah, \nGa., which he sent us. \n\nThese excerpts are in the line of the \nusual manly and vigorous addresses of this \nfair minded judge.

The tables in the dining hall \nseated eight and it was the custom for the students to choose those whom \nthey [wished] wanted at their respective tables.for the term of about three months. \n\nThose who had not been invited to sit at any special table were seatedby \nthe lady who had charge of the dining room.  In the middle of the term some \nfriend would invite me to sit at a table which she was arranging for the one \nto follow, and I would cheerfully consent to do so. Later on another friend \nwould invite me to sit at her table and I would accept, forgetting that I had \nalready promised to sit with another group.  Each of these girls would send in my name as one of the eight who had promised to sit at her table. Then when \nI was not seated at on of the tables to which I had been invited, naturally \nthere was some confusion and explanations had to be made.  Mrs Hatch used to say I gave her a great deal of trouble, because too many people wanted me to \nsit at their tables.  If were white, it might  seem like conceit for me to relate \nthis. But I mentionthese facts to show that as a colored girl I was accorded \nthe same treatment Oberlin College at that time as a white girl under similar circumstances would have received.  Outward manifestations of prejudice \nagainst colored students in Ladies Hall would not have been tolerated for one \nminute by those in authority at that time.  Occasionally a colored girl would complain about something which she considered a \"slight\", but as a rule, it was either \nbecause she was \"looking for trouble\", or because she imagined something disagreeable \nwhich was not intended. Later on, however, conditions affecting colored \nstudents materially changed for the worse. This phase of the subject will \nbe discussed in another chapter.\n\nMy associates in college were naturally members of my own class. Until I \nreached the Junior year I had only one colored class mate who lived in the \ntown.  During the three years I lived in Ladies Hall, when I was in the Senior\nPreparatory and Freshman classes and during my Senior year, when I roomed with \none of my colored class mates I never once felt I was being discriminated \nagainst on account of my color.  During my Senior Preparatory year there was an \nOhio girl at Ladies Hall who danced exceedingly well and who enjoyed it too. \nIn that respect it was a case of two souls and two feet but with a single \n\n[*11*]\nthought, for there was nothing I enjoyed then more than dancing.  Even unto\nthis day I derive great pleasure from tripping the light fantastic toe. \nThe Ohio girl and I were regular partners and few were the evenings just before \n\"study hour,\" when we did not [go] hie to the \"Gym\" and go through all the steps we knew.  Dancing was not so common then as it is now and was usually frowned upon \nby everybody who wanted to be considered intellectual or who sighed to be classified as a High Brow.  College girls were not allowed to dance at any class \nfunction.  But both the teachers in Ladies Hall and the very serious-minded \ngirls encouraged my partner and myself to dance by frequently coming to look at \nus and complimenting us.\n\nDuring [the] my Senior year I secured permission from Mrs. A.A. F. Johnston who had charge of college women which it is claimed she had never given before.  Lawrence Barrett and Marie Wainright were producing the plays of Shakespeare in Cleveland \nOhio and I wanted very much to go to see them.  The girls with whom I discussed\nthe matter advised me not to tell \"Lady J\" what I wanted to do, but \njust get permission to go to Cleveland and [go to] \"take in\" the theatre after I arrived. But I decided to pursue a different course. \"Mrs. Johnston,\" I said, as I entered \nher office, \"I want very much to go to Cleveland so that I may see two \nShakespearian plays.  My classmate will go with me. We will attend the matinee \nand performance at night and return the next day.\"  I asked permission to do \nthis as though it were nothing unusual and looked Mrs. Johnston straight in \nthe eye as I spoke.  \"If you want to get permission to do anything,\" the girls \nused to say, \"dont go to Lady J like a condemned criminal. Look her straight \nin the eye, as though you knew exactly what you wanted and expected to get it. \nMrs. Johnston's hair was a beautiful auburn and she wore two little curls, one \non each side of her head.  Her face became as red as fire, when I was asking \nher to let me go to the theatre. The very audacity of the request silenced \nher for a second, but she gave me permission most graciously and expressed the \nhope that we would have a nice time.On another occasion when I had to take a \njourney for my father I had no difficulty whatever in securing permission to \ngo.

Daring\nto expose one's self to the charge of this\ncrime, we venture a suggestion to the race,\nhoping thereby to attract its attention to\nthe weightier matters of the law.\n\nFirst, surrender no rights now enjoyed.\nThe gifts of the gods should not be given\nup. Be these rights at the ballot or in\ntrade, hold that fast which thou hast, that\nno man take thy crown.

No man should clamor\nfor rights when his duty has been neglected.\nNo clamoring for rights has ever made a\nman or settled a problem, but the wise,\nsteady, conscientious and persistent performance\nof duty under unfavorable circumstances\nhas won and enforced rights\nand has made men fit for large liberty.\nThe rights of citizenship are determined by\nand based upon duty of citizenship.\n\nHome life is the supreme need of the\nhour.

It is true that the leaders\nof the race direct the people to the \n\nnecessity of acquiring homes as well as the\nwork of building churches. Homes first,\nchurches next.\n\nEducate! Educate!

Many of them\nwere broken in body but were of elastic\nstep and buoyant hope. The space of time\nis too short to take a reckoning, nevertheless,\nthe results attained prophesy large\npossibilities. Up to this date all the facts\nconcerning this formerly stupid Hamite\nhave proved themselves \"humorously careless\nof the reputation of those prophets\"\nwho saw and prophesied nothing but woe\nfor the race and woe for the nation.\nAmong these dry bones, that are now the\nlaughing stock of the school children, are\nthese: the race will die in freedom; it cannot\nperpetuate itself except in slavery;\nthey cannot learn, their heads are too thick;\nthey will never be able to care for themselves\n\nIN THE SANCTUM   697\n\nthemselves; they will wreck the government;\nthey will be a perpetual ward of the nation,\netc., etc.\n\nBut freedom came and the race is better\nand is better off in one week under this\ncondition than it was in a decade of\nslavery.\n\nBut the race must remember that freedom\ndoes not mean license, and that liberty\nis not interchangeable with libertinism.\nThe highest gift of freedom is the prerogative\nto do right as interpreted by law and\nChristian conscience.\n\nAtlanta to the Front\n\nThe Finance Committee of the City\nCouncil, cooperating with the Trustees of\nthe Carnegie Library, have decided to accept\nMr. Carnegie's gift of $10,000 to erect\na library for the colored people. The terms\nof the gift require that the city shall furnish\nthe ground and sustain the library by\nan appropriation of $1,000 a year. The\nMen's Monday Club of the city began a\ndiscussion of this subject some time ago.\nThey appointed a committee to confer with\nthe Trustees of the Carnegie Library. The\nresult of that conference was that the board\nlaid the whole subject before Mr. Carnegie\nwith the request that he make a special gift\nfor this purpose. The club appointed Doctors\nH. H. Proctor, J. W. E. Bowen, and\nProf. Jordan to appear before the committee,\nand the committee unanimously\nrecommends the acceptance of the gift.\n\nThis step puts Atlanta in the lead as a\nSouthern city in making every provision\nfor the comfort and advancement of the\nrace. It is another evidence of the oft repeated\nstatement that when the best white\nmen and the best black men get together\non any subject, they see eye to eye and\nthere is never any friction.\n\nWe hail this movement as a tightening\nof the links between the races and an assurance\nthat we will find a safe and high\nground for both to stand upon in the spirit\nof true brotherhood.\n\nThe Negro and the Social Order\n\nThe following communication was written\nby an independent and friendly person.\nHe takes the editors of THE VOICE to task\nfor classing \"Socialists\" with other obnoxious\norganizations.

Let us try to recognize the fact\nthat the terrible sin of lust which is to-day blighting so many lives\nand homes, comes from the misuse and misconception of God's great\ngift of creative power - that tremendous force which should link humanity\nmost closely with the Creator, turned aside and become the\ngreatest factor in its destruction.\n\nHow long must the thick veil of ignorance and prejudice continue\nto pervert the vision of vast multitudes, how long will their ears be\ndeaf to the cry wrung from centuries of enslaved motherhood, dwarfed\nand defrauded childhood, robbed of its most precious inheritance?\n\nPraise God, the answer comes clear and sure to any who reads\naright the signs of the times of the times, \"The people shall know the truth and\nthe truth shall make them free.\" Never before were there so many\nvoices proclaiming the saving knowledge, for lack of which the people\nperish, never were there so many eager listeners, hungry for information\nregarding the most sacred attributes of human life.\n\nParents are awakening to a keen realization of the sacredness\nof their responsibility. Fathers as well as mothers are catching\nglorified visions of their holy religion to posterity, and this in itself\nmeans much. Poets and sages in centuries past have told\nwomen of their divine mission can never be too strongly emphasized;\nyet but half the story was told, for must not the race have\nfathers as well as mothers, and is not fatherhood as well as motherhood\na sacred calling? Recalling how little emphasis has\nheretofore been placed on this half of the question, is it any wonder\nthat so few men have any adequate conception of the sacred meaning\nof fatherhood? The late Ellice Hopkins, enlarging on this\nthought quotes this touching pen-picture of father-love; - \"Look at\nthis dying father - dying in the faith, having fought the good fight,\nand all heaven now opening before his dying gaze. Yet he withdraws\nhis thoughts from that great hereafter to center them upon\nthe little lad who stands at his bedside. His hands wander over the\ngolden head with 'The vast sad tenderness of dying men.' \"\n\n\"He triumphs over pain and weakness that he may plot and plan\nevery detail of the young life which he can no longer live to guide\nand direct. And when at length he seems to have passed into the\nlast darkness, and they hold up the child to see if he will yet recognize\n\nTHE LIGHT.   9\n\nrecognize him, suddenly the spirit seems to sweep back over the dark river\nwhich it had almost crossed, and an ineffable light illumines the dying\nface as his lips meet the lips of his little son in one last supreme\nkiss - the father-love for one moment vanquishing death itself. And\nwhat, I ask, must be the sin of desecrating and defiling such a function\nas this, this function of fatherhood in which man seems to touch upon\nGod Himself and become the representative of the Father in heaven -\nwhat must be the guilt of turning it into a subject of filthy jests and\na source of unclean actions?\"\n\nThoughtful parents, reading of the 300,000 women leading impure\nlives of open shame in our home land, and of the five times that\nnumber of men who have lost the priceless pearl of purity, are asking\nin anguish of soul, \"What can be done to stay this widespread destruction\nere it touches our own boys and girls?\" If I were asked to\nattempt to answer this all important question in one brief sentence I\nwould say:- As the greatest cause of impurity is ignorance, so the\nmost successful cure must be wrought through the spreading of\nknowledge - knowledge of those sacred principles of heart purity so\nvitally necessary to purity of life. And to every earnest seeker after\ntruth, the question is not, \"What are the purity principles taught by\nthis organization or that society?\" but rather, \"What would God\nhave me believe as His truth?\" Reader, go with God alone into the\nsilence, ask Him there the secret of His purpose in giving to humanity\ncreative power, and His will in regard to the right use thereof.\nAsk Him to sweep away from your thought all previous false teachings\nand prepare your heart and mind for the reception of His truth.\nDoubt not, He will guide and teach thee aright in His own good time\nand way. Perhaps He will send His blessed truth to you then and\nthere, if \"ye are able to bear it.\" Perhaps He will send it later through\nthe voice or pen of one of His servants who know His will, but believe\nHim, He will send the message to you which your heart needs.\nThen when little faces look into yours, asking an explanation of the\nstrange, sweet mystery of life and its reproduction, you can, through\nHis enabling grace, in gentle reverent words, tell them God's beautiful \ntruth, filling the receptive, childish mind so full of its beauty and\nsacredness that there will never after be any room for the unclean\ninformation so freely offered on every playground.\n\nParents, unto you is given, as to none others, the solution of the\npurity problem. In the very nature of the case, this had to be so, for\nit is a question which concerns you in a very special way, going as it\ndoes to the very root of all that makes parenthood sacred, homes dear,\nand family life enduring.

From private conversations with my white friends, from the\nquestions frequently asked me, when I have addressed Forums in the East, from\nstatements often made in the press, I am persuaded that the average white\nperson believes that there is nothing which a colored man wants to do so much\nas to marry a white woman and nothing a colored woman desires more than to\nmarry a white man.  It will do no harm, therefore, to show that some colored\npeople do not entertain this point of view.\n     On my way to Florence from Berlin I had several experiences which are\nindelibly impressed upon my mind.  At one of the stations where I changed cars late in the afternoon,\nI had gone into an apartment (?) exclusively for women.  At that time\nthere were apartments exclusively for women, compartments exclusively for men\nand apartments for both sexes.  I was obliged to travel all night and I felt\nperfectly safe taking an apartment exclusively for women.  I knew I could stretch\nout on the long seat and have a good rest.  About two or three o'clock\nin the morning I heard the door of the compartment open and, when I looked up\nhalf asleep to see who had entered.  I saw it was a man.  Then I heard the\nguard lock the door and I knew I was locked alone in the compartment with a man whom\nI did not know.\n     I could not help feeling that this man had made it worth the porter's\nwhile to allow him to enter the woman's compartment at night against the rules.\n     As soon as he started the conversation I knew he was German and he knew\nI was an American.  I told him I had come abroad to study and was on my way\nto Florence to study Italian and visit the wonderful art galleries there.\nWhatever might have been his intentions, when he induced or bribed the\nguard to let him enter a compartment at night exclusively for women, he was one of the\nmost delightful and helpful casual acquaintances I have ever met.  He was \nwell acquainted with influential people in Florence and gave me letters of \nintroduction to several of them.  He knew Florence by heart and advised me\nwhat to see and how to see it.\n     Several times since then I have read about murders which were committed\nin broad day light in the compartments of England and Europe and a shiver\n56\nalways run down my spinal column when I think of my experiences enroute\nto Florence, awakened out of a sound sleep in a foreign land, finding myself\nconfronted by a strange man and knowing I was locked alone in a compartment\nwith him on a train which was speeding along in the dark.\n     Still another incident fraught with danger occurred on this trip.\nBaedeker's Guide Book advised those who wished to get an unusually fine view of\nGenoa to arise very early in the morning and go to the top of a certain\nchurch.  The directions were explicit and clear.  One had to as cend a narrow\nsteep stairway in the back of the church and keep climbing till he reached\nthe spot from which the superb view could be obtained.  The morning after I\nreached Genoa I arose very early, full of enthusiasm and made my way to this church.\n I had climbed about half way up the steep, narrow stairway, when I heard a \nnoise behind me. Turning around quickly I saw in the dark the form of a \nman following me.  My heart beat fast, but there was nothing to do but continue\nthe ascent.  Come what might, I certainly could not turn back.  When I\nreached the top of the stairway and stepped out on the tower I explained to\nthe man who had followed me why I was there.  He was the sexton of the church\nand without saying so, he (?) very plainly that he was surprised to see a\nyoung woman all alone so early in the morning.\n     After leaving the church the beautiful Mediterranean sea beckoned me on.\nI wanted to dip my hand into the water and gaze at it to my heart's content.\nWhile I was standing on the shore filled with joyous enthusiasm two men\ncame by in a boat and asked me if I did not want to take a ride on the sea.\n     After settling upon the price they would charge I stepped into the boat\nand was soon rowing happily along.  My mind was so occupied with what I was\nthat the men had rowed a long distance before I suddenly realized how far\nwe were from the shore.  When I asked them to return, they did not comply\nwith my request at first and I had to insist several times that I did not\nwant to row any further, before they turned toward the shore.

SIDNEY C. KENDALL, LOS ANGELES. \n\nA candid discussion of this subject will result in the most disgraceful \nstory that was ever written. The sporadic strands of infamy \nwith which the public have already been made familiar through police \ninvestigations in different cities have cited wide-spread indignation.\nIt now remains to collect these details into one hideous whole \nin the hope that the clamor for reform may be led to take some \npractical and effective shape. The story of police relations with the \nSocial Evil begins in Paris, in which city, for some occult reason, \npolice authorities pretend to look for guidance in dealing with the \nmatter. This constant quoting of Paris, however, is mere pretense:\nfor the Parisian system, bad as it is, is almost humane compared with \nthe unrestricted brutality of American police regulation. \n\nIf the charge of \"strong language\" is made against this article, \nmy answer is that in the presence of the ghastly facts all language is \nweak. \n\nBy a law passed in Paris in 1684 the Lieutenant of Police was\ngiven unlimited control of, what for the sake of euphony is called the \nSocial Evil. This is the beginning of exclusive police management \nof that unsavory department of civil government. It is significant \nthat it is also the beginning of that tacit admission on the part of \ncivic authorities that the Social Evil is a necessity for which provision \nmust be made. \n\nIn 1713 these powers were largely curtailed. A law was passed \nby which the Social Evil was committed, in part, to the royal commissaries \nor judges. Still the Lieutenant of Police retained large \ndiscretionary powers. The whole matter, however, in spite of laws \nto the contrary, fell more and more into the hands of the police. \n\nIn 1802 the Prefect of Police, upon his own authority, established \na system of registration and sanitary inspection. By this time, also, \nthe service of the courts had so far declined that the status of a suspected\nwoman had come to be decided by the police in a purely arbitrary \nmanner. To increase their control, the police introduced the \nplan of limiting the Social Evil to houses especially licensed for that    \npurpose. Thus they were enabled to keep tab on both the women \nand the places where they plied their profession. Could anything be \nmore desired to make police control absolute? \n ", "44", 124, 124, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00077", "[59]\nof 8 or 10 miles, I did not hesitate to do so.  It never occurred to me that\nany danger would evertake me no matter how few people I met on the road.\n     While I lived in Florence I especially enjoyed visiting the places and\nseeing the pictures mentioned by George Eliot in her incomparable Romela.\nI found an edition of two small volumes bound in white trimmed in red in which\nunmounted photographs had been pasted on a page and inserted opposite the passages\nwhich they illustrated.  As, book in hand, I went from place to place to\nsee a picture or to stand on the very spot on which a certain character stood\nI felt that I was alking and talking with the great novelist herself.\n     The monasteries and the nunneries were a never-failing source of interest\nto me.  I never tired seeing the monks themselves and the great stone [stru]\nstructures hoary with age in which they lived and moved and had their being.\nI acquired the habit of going into the beautiful, old Catholic churches several\ntimes a day.  The architecture, the pictures and the atmosphere of those\ngrand old structures lifted me out of myself and directed my thoughts up ward\nfrom the material and sordid affairs of the earth.\n     One morning about two o'clock I received a cablegram from my father telling\nme that he would leave Memphis on a certain date to take a steamer in New\nYork and spend the summer in Europe.  He landed at Bremerhafen and came on to\nFrankfort-on the Main where I met him.  He had brought the whole family with\nhim - his wife, Robert about four years old and little Annette who was only two\ntwo.  I immediately took charge of my little sister, and let Father do thehonors\nfor the young brother.  I had mapped out a delightful itinerary of several\nmonths, not knowing the children would be members of the party.  And although\ntheir strength was not overtaxed, it was surprising how little of my program\nhad to be revised or eliminated and how much of it was carried out as originally\nplanned in spite of the presence of two small children.\n      First, we went from Frankfort on the Main to Heidelberg, not only\nto see that wonderful old castle which had been nearly destroyed by Napoleon,\nbut to take a package to a young woman who was studying there.  She was the\ndaughter of a neighbor who had lived next door to us in Memphis for years\nand who belonged to one of the old aristocratic, slave-holding families\n\n[60]\nof the South.  If, on some fine morning in the palmy days of slavery any one\nhad told the father of this woman that on a particular summer day less than forty\nyears from that date a man then held in slavery would be taking a tour through\nEurope with his family and would be politely requested by his daughter\nto deliver a package to his granddaughter in Heidelberg Germany, he would either\nhave laughed at the man who could imagine such a preposterous situation or\nhe would have suggested that he put into an insane asylum.  Through some of the\nmost beautiful sections of Switzerland and Italy we passed, going up the Rigi, of course,\nand remaining in London and Paris several weeks.\n   [On the way home] On ship board, as we were ploughing through the\n[to the steamer which brought us home there was a group of jolly people]\nocean on our way home something quite unexpected happened.  One of the passengers\n[who contributed a great deal both to my own pleasure and to that of the]\nbecame greatly infatuated with me and it was difficult to prevent him\n[other passengers.]\nfrom showing me marked attention, whenever he was in my company.  He was a matter\nof fact, level-headed sort of a man, deeply engrossed in business and\nnot al all the type which one would suspect of losing his head about any girl,\nparticularly a colored girl.  Previous to that experience the only men who had\nbeen especially interested in me had been quite young - near my own age.  It\nhad always been quite easy to convince them that the case was not so serious\nas they thought it was.  But with this mature business man the proposition was \nentirely different.  Before leaving the steamer he had insisted upon coming\nto see me at my mother's residence in New York.  He wanted to talk with me\nabout something very important, he said.  Without going into details I can here\nand now truthfully record that I have seldom had greater difficulty in refuting\narguments presented by an opponent and in persuading him to listen to\nmine that I did when this business man proposed marriage to me.  People of\ndifferent races had a perfect right to marry each other, he stoutly maintained,\nand he ridiculed the statements I had previously made about believing\nin absolute equality if I did not agree with him in this respect.\n     If I married a white man in the United States, I explained, I knew I\nwould be perfectly wretched, because I would be shunned by black and white\nalike.  He had thought that all out, he declared and had already decided to\ntake me to Mexico.

We have done nothing like this. We have handed the \nSocial Evil over to the police in toto. We have passed state laws and \ncity ordinances to enable them to do effective work. And what have \nthey done?\n\nThe reader is referred to articles by Lincoln Steffen in McClure's \nMagazine, now published in book form; to the Report of the Committee \nof Fifteen on the Social Evil in New York; to Theodore Roosevelt's \narticles on the police in New York; to lectures and articles by \nParkhurst and Jacob Riis; to William Stead's \"If Christ came to \nChicago;\" to Mrs. Edholm's \"Traffic in Girls;\" to the reports of exposures \nin Minneapolis, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Seattle, \nSan Francisco and elsewhere-in short to the whole literature of \nsocial reform that is now multiplying so rapidly. From these sources \nwe learn that the police have:\n\n1. Permitted the multiplication of immoral houses where such \nplaces are prohibited both by state law and civic ordinances. \n2. Collected unlawful tribute from immoral houses as the price \nof their permission. \n3. Levied blackmail upon the hapless victims of the traffic in lust.\n4. Compelled those victims to serve them without compensation. \n5. Served as touts and pandours to immoral houses. \n6. Established a system of unlawful inspection, and this not in \ngood faith but as a means of further extortion. \n7. Assisted in procuring victims to replenish the waste of this \nawful traffic. \n8. Prevented the escape of women who were desirous of returning \nto a virtuous life. \n9. Returned to immoral houses women who have made escape. \n10. Impeded the efforts of humane persons who were desirous of \nrescuing fallen women. \n\nLet no one challenge these charges until he has examined the \nliterature named above. To several of the items in this decalogue of \ninfamy I have been personally an eye witness and I know whereof I \naffirm. Some of these things have been done with such frequency \nthat they have come to be regarded as regular police practice. \n\nWhat is the result of our present policy?\n\nVerily a condition that cries to Heaven. It is estimated that \nthere are 300,000 fallen women in America. Very few of them have \ntaken voluntarily to this life. The vast majority of them were \n\"procured\" by every means that lust can prompt or avarice devise. \nRead \"The Cadet and His Victim\" in the Report of the Fifteen and \nwonder why such a statement did not bring the united manhood of \n\n\nTHE LIGHT. \n\n17 \n\nthis nation to its feet with an indignant demand that the whole vile \ntraffic should be exterminated. Our police are charged with complicity \nin this crime against humanity. We entrusted them without reserve  \nwith this awful problem, to be suppressed if possible, certainly \nto be restricted as far as this might be accomplished by the rigid enforcement \nof good laws. They have ignored our laws, protected the \nlaw-breakers and shared the profits of crime. They have fostered \nand extended the very evil they were expected to reduce. \n\nOh! the pity of it. Pursued by cadets, procurers, macquerreaux, \nand libertines; snared by advertisements, trapped by employment agencies, \ndeceived by lovers; betrayed, drugged, abducted, outraged \nwith violence, ruined, no matter how, and because ruined, outcast, \noutlawed, homeless, friendless, forsaken by God and man, our lost \nand hunted sister, whom at one time we would have protected with   \nour heart's blood, after running the gauntlet of the vilest of the vilest\nof human brutes, finds her last and bitterest oppressor in the blue \ncoated official to whose guardianship society had consigned her. \n\nWhy have the police done this? \n\nThe answer to this question would also answer the other questions \nthat have cropped up in the course of this article. \n\nThe question suggests a distinction with which the public mind \nhas not yet become familiar. The ruling factor in the Social Evil is \nnot lust but avarice. It does not exist because men are lustful but \nbecause they are avaricious. Men are lustful because they have every \ninducement to become so. And the greatest inducement is the existence \nin every city of an open market of women, easy to access. And \nthis market is maintained because there is money in it. The traders \nin women wear diamonds and lounge in the rotundas of leading hotels.\nPersons who derive great revenues from properties leased for the purposes \nof this traffic hold high places in society. Between these and \ntheir victims stands the police making terms with both. The plunder \nof fallen women is one of the fattest perquisites of office. \n\nFallen women were consigned to the care of the police and no \nquestions asked: unlimited opportunities for lust and avarice: and as \na result: see the above list of charges. \n\nIt is only fair to add that these charges do not apply to the police \nas a whole. The force has simply fallen into bad hands. Theodore\nRoosevelt tells us that for a police to incur the hostility of \nthe keeper of an immoral house by an inconvenient display of zeal \nwas detrimental to his interests with his superiors. Again, he tells \nus that when the control of the police in New York changed its character \nthe well disposed in the rank and file took heart and showed \nthat the cause of decency and humanity could count on powerful \nsupport.

The\nPuritan has stood upon the street corners\nand smitten his breast and thanked God\nthat he was better than his Southern\nbrother, while in his own section he has\ndebarred the Negro by labor unions and in\nother ways from even the ordinary avenues\nof labor. Mr. Roosevelt insists that the\nNorth shall be consistent. He does not\nwant the Northerner to say less about the\nway the South treats the Negro, but he\ndoes want the North to do more for the\nNegro by giving him fair-play in that section.\nHe says: \"Our effort should be to\nsecure to each man, whatsoever his color,\nequality of opportunity, equality of treatment\nbefore the law. As a people striving\nto shape our actions in accordance with the\ngreat law of righteousness, we cannot\nafford to take part in or be indifferent to\nthe oppression or maltreatment of any man\nwho, against crushing disadvantages, has\nby his own industry, energy, self-respect\nand perseverance struggled upward to a\nposition which would entitle him to the\nrespect of his fellows, if only his skin were\nof a different color.\" He says further:\n\n\"Every generous impulse in us revolts at the\nthought of thrusting down instead of helping up\nsuch a man. To deny any man the fair treatment\ngranted to others no better than he is to commit a\n\nwrong upon him - a wrong sure to react in the long\nrun upon those guilty of such denial. The only\nsafe principle upon which Americans can act is\nthat of 'all men up,' not that of 'some men down.'\nIf in any community the level of intelligence,\nmorality and thrift among the colored men can be\nraised, it is, humanly speaking, sure that the same\nlevel among the whites will be raised to an even\nhigher degree; and it is no less sure that the\ndebasement of the blacks will in the end carry\nwith it an attendant debasement of the whites.\n\n\"The problem is so to adjust the relations\nbetween two races of different ethnic type that the\nrights of neither be abridged nor jeopardized; that\nthe backward race be trained so that it may enter\ninto the possession of true freedom, while the forward\nrace is enabled to preserve unharmed  the\nhigh civilization wrought out by its forefathers.\nThe working out of this problem must necessarily\nbe slow; it is not possible in off-hand fashion to\nobtain or to confer the priceless boons of freedom,\nindustrial efficiency, political capacity and domestic\nmorality. Nor is it only necessary to train the\ncolored man; it is quite as necessary to train the\nwhite man, for on his shoulders rests a well nigh\nunparalleled sociological responsibility. It is a\nproblem demanding the best thought, the utmost\npatience, the most earnest effort, the broadest\ncharity, of the statesman, the student, the philanthropist;\nof the leaders of thought in every department\nof our national life. The church can be a\nmost important factor in solving it aright. But\nabove all else we need for its successful solution,\nthe sober, kindly, steadfast, unselfish performance\nof duty by the average plain citizen in his every\nday dealings with his fellows.\n\n\"In the first place, it is true of the colored man,\nas it is true of the white man, that in the long run\nhis fate must depend far more upon his own effort\nthan upon the efforts of any outside friend. Every\nvicious, venal, or ignorant colored man is an even\ngreater foe to his own race than to the community\nas a whole. The colored man's self-respect entitles\nhim to do that share in the political work of the\ncountry which is warranted by his individual\nability and integrity and the position he has won\nfor himself. But the prime requisite of the race is\nmoral and industrial uplifting.\n\n\"Laziness and shiftlessness, these, and above all,\nvice and criminality of every kind, are evils more\npotent for harm to the black race than all acts of\noppression of white men put together. The colored\nman who fails to condemn crime in another\ncolored man, who fails to cooperate in all lawful\nways in bringing colored criminals to justice, is\nthe worst enemy of his own people, as well as an\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW   149\n\nenemy to all the people. Law-abiding black men\nshould, for the sake of their race, be foremost in\nrelentless and unceasing warfare against law-\nbreaking black men. If the standards of private\nmorality and industrial efficiency can be raised\nhigh enough among the black race, then its future\non this continent is secure. The stability and\npurity of the home is vital to the welfare of the\nblack race, as it is to the welfare of any race.\"\n\nIn speaking about \"social equality\"\nMr. Roosevelt well says that this is \"a question\nwhich must, of course, be left to the\npeople of each community to settle for\nthemselves, as in such a matter no one community \n- and indeed no one individual -\ncan dictate to any other; always provided\nthat in each locality men keep in mind the\nfact that there must be no confusing of\ncivil privileges with social intercourse.\nCivil law cannot regulate social practices.\nSociety, as such, is a law unto itself, and\nwill always regulate its own practices and\nhabits. Full recognition of the fundamental\nfact that all men should stand on\nan equal footing, as regards civil privileges,\nin no way interferes with recognition of the\nfurther fact that all reflecting men of both\nraces are united in feeling that race purity\nmust be maintained.\"\n\nThis is our position exactly. No colored\nman cares anything about thrusting himself\nsocially upon the white people. The\nfact is we feel that we are just as good as\nthey are and do not care one iota to couple\nup in purely social affairs with them. The\nNegro gentleman does not intrude his\npresence upon his own race where he feels\nthat he is not wanted. There need be no \nlaws made for this. If anything is needed\nit is more education and refinement as a\ngentleman. He will then feel that he cannot\nafford to intrude. Mr. Roosevelt quotes\nextensively from an address of the Right\nReverend Robert Strange, bishop co-adjutor\nof North Carolina, and endorses in toto\nwhat the good bishop says. The particular\npassage he quoted from the bishop\nfollows:\n\n\"What should the white men of the South do\nfor the Negro? They must give him a free hand,\na fair field, and a cordial Godspeed, the two races\nworking together for their mutual benefit and for\nthe development of our common country. He\nmust have liberty, equal opportunity to make his\nliving, to earn his bread, to build his home. He\nmust have justice, equal rights, and protection\nbefore the law. He must have the same political\nprivileges; the suffrage should be based on character\nand intelligence for white and black alike.\nHe must have the same public advantages of education;\nthe public schools are for all the people,\nwhatever their color or condition. The white men\nof the South should give hearty and respectful\nconsideration to the exceptional men of the Negro\nrace, to those who have the character, the ability\nand the desire to be lawyers, physicians, teachers,\npreachers, leaders of thought and conduct among\ntheir own men and women. We should give them\ncheer and opportunity to gratify every laudable\nambition, and to seek every innocent satisfaction\namong their own people. Finally, the best white\nmen of the South should have frequent conferences\nwith the best colored men, where in frank, earnest\nand sympathetic discussion they might understand\neach other better, smooth difficulties, and\nso guide and encourage the weaker race.\"\n\nIt will be noted here that the President\njoins the bishop in saying that the Negro\n\"must have the same political privileges\"\nand \"the same public advantages of education\"\nas the white man. It seems to us\nthat here is where Mr. Roosevelt has taken\na stand in advance of some of our own\nleaders. Dr. Booker T.

The weather was bitter cold \nand much of the fighting was done in a \ndriving snow. The Russian shells glided \noff from the frozen fortifications of the Japs \nlike so many pebbles. The Russians were \ndriven back with heavy losses, some correspondents \nestimating that the Russians \nlost from 30,000 to 40,000 men while the  \nJapanese lost only about 7,000. Whatever \nwas Kuropatkin's object, if he ordered the \nmovement at all, it is now certain that he was \nbalked by a swift concentration of Oyama's \nforces at the point of attack.

Great crowds of laborers who \nwere out on strike for better treatment by \ntheir employers in St. Petersburg wanted \nto see and petition the Czar. Led by \nFather Gopon, a Russian Priest, they had \ndrawn up a set of petitions which they \ndemanded that they should be allowed to \nread in the hearing of their ruler. They \nwere intent on doing the Czar no harm for \nevery one of the workmen were willing to \ndie to protect the \"Little Father.\" They \n\nFATHER GOPON \nWho led the Strikers to the Czar's Winter Palace\n\nknew that the Czar did not know how they \nwere treated, and that he would help them \nif he could hear the truth from their own \nlips. But they were commanded on Saturday \nnot to assemble in front of the Czar's \npalace. Troops were stationed there to see \nthat all who gathered were dispersed. But \nthe people were determined to see the \n\"Little Father.\" They were unarmed. \nSome of them expected to die. But they \nexpected that their blood would be such \na mighty protest against despotism that \nall the sub-strata and middle classes in Russia \nwould rise in revolt. Thus the great \nmasses surged up towards the Czar's Winter \npalace. They refused to disperse when \ncommanded by the troops and were fired \nupon. Hundreds of the strikers fell \nwounded and dying in the snow. The rest \nfled in terror, but martyrdom had, with \nsplendid courage, flung its protest in the \nface of absolutism. The people who loved \nand reverenced the Czar as \"The Little\nFather\" no longer love him, but hate him. \nThey asked him as their father, for bread \nand he gave them a stone. The people now \nrealize that life under the present flag is a \ngreat tragedy and they have resolved to \nmake the most of it.

The wide and \neven international interest manifested in \nCharles Wagner's little book, \"The Simple \nLife,\" attests that he has given the reading \nworld a good book, if not a great one, and \na suggestive theme if not an original one. \nOver one hundred thousand copies if \"The \nSimple Life\" have been sold in the United \nStates. No other book outside of the realm \nof fiction has found such favor with the \nreading public. \n\nThe whole secret of the popularity of \n\"The Simple Life\" is that the author has \nsounded the fundamental note in human \nlife. When all the extremes of our intellectual \nlife from Felix Adler to Bishop Ireland, \nrise up and call blessed the man who \nhas written so simply yet strongly on the \npresent day needs of a distracted people, it \nis a far call to the average man or woman \nto pause and reflect. \n\nPresident Roosevelt must surely have \nfound in this little volume the vision splendid, \nwhen he expressed the wish that all of \nhis countrymen might read \"The Simple Life.\"\n\nThere is much in the life work of this \nParis pastor that is both interesting and \ninstructive, while the purity of his spirit is \nfully revealed on the printed pages of his \npublished works: \"The Simple Life,\" \n\"Courage,\" and \"Youth\". \n\nHe lives a consecrated life, full of simple \njoys and work for others. No one can mistake \nthe ma after reading his book, and \nfew people can read his book without feeling  \nthat it is exactly what he needs as a cure \nfor the distempers of false pride, envy, pretense, \nand the love of mere things. The \nlimpid style of the book, the directness of \nits message and its heart-searching appeals\ngive it human value that can be shared in \ncommon by all of its readers. \n\nCharles Wagner's visit to America a few \nweeks ago was an interesting event. He \ndelivered several addresses upon several \noccasions which were at all time sane, \ninspiring and helpful. He is not an \noracle, but he is certainly more than a \nmere philosopher. With him a \"man \nis one who believes in life,\" not the\nartificial life, that is smothered by wornout \ntraditions, clothed in the toggery of fashion's \nmandates, speaking a borrowed language\nand swayed by the \"downward way \nof wants,\" but the natural, human and God-\ngiven life that seeks to express itself naturally \nand to live honestly. \n\nThe meaning of \"The Simple Life\" from \nthe author's standpoint may be found in his \nlucid and easy discussion of such subjects \nas: \"The Simplicity of Speech,\" \"Simplicity \nof Thought,\" \"Simple Duty,\" \"Simple \nNeeds,\" \"The Mercenary Spirit,\"\n\"The Inglorious Good,\" \"Pride and Simplicity\"\nand \"The Education for Simplicity.\"\n\nWhile reading the essays we are made to \nfeel how many of the blessed things and \ngood things in life we miss, in our mad\nrush for the unattainable and the striving \nto live some one else's life, instead of our \nown. \n\nPastor Wagner's interpretation of the simple \nlife is that it is not a thing of definitions \nmerely, or a rule of conduct, but \"a state\nof mind.\" \"A man is simple when his \nchief care is the wish to be what he ought \nto be, that is to say, honestly and naturally \nhuman.\" \"Where the natural law rules \nin the heart, disorder vanishes.\"\n\nHow different all this is to what we have \nbeen taught to believe about simplicity!\n\n\nTHE TIMELY MESSAGE OF THE SIMPLE LIFE          161\n\nWe have believed that to be simple is to be \nfoolish. Quite to the contrary is the teaching \nof this precious book. To be simple is \nto \"fill the highest human destiny.\" To\nlive the simple life is to discover and disclose \nthe best there is in our own lives. If it e \nin us to become a good engineer, for example, \nshall we, through false pride or at the \ndictate of false values of what is respectable, \ninsist upon becoming a doctor or a \nmusician, or some other calling for which \nwe are not fitted? By this course do we \nnot add to the complications of our own \nexistence?\n\nThus Pastor Wagner exhorts: \"Let a \nflower be a flower, a swallow a swallow, a \nrock a rock, and let a man be a man and \nnot a fox or a hare or a bird of prey; this \nis the sum of the whole matter.\"\n\nIn speaking of the simplicity of thought, \nwe are admonished that first of all, \"humanity \nlives by confidence.\" \"Every thing \nthat shakes the confidence is evil - poison, \nand not food. We do not dare to hope \nenough.\"\n\n\"The men of our day have developed \nstrange timidities\" to such an extent that \nthere is a helpful lesson in the thought that \nwe are only at our best when our confidence \nin ourselves, in our race and in this God-\nruled universe of mind and matter is strong \nagainst the \"strange timidities\" and pessimism \nthat are ever sounding in our ears. \n\nIn the same spirit is discussed the art of \nsimplicity of speech \"Do we use words to \ndisguise or to disclose our thoughts and \nfeelings? Be men and speak the speech of \nhonor!\" \"An hour of plain dealing does \nmore for the salvation of the world than \nyears of duplicity.\" \"Be sincere, moderate, \nsimple in expression of your feelings and \nopinions in private and in public alike.\"\n\nHow many of us can say that we need no \nlessons in the art of simplicity of speech?\nIs it not all too common that when we are \ncarried away with our vanity to speak\ngrandly, even at the expense of clearness \nand truth? How badly off we would be, if \nthere were no such things as adjectives, and \nhow many orators would be put out of business \nif exordiums and perorations could be \neffectively prohibited?\n\nSpeaking of \"simple needs,\" we are\nunpleasantly reminded that \"it is not favorable \nto our development and happiness to \nhave a multitude of needs and to spend all \nof our energies to the satisfaction of them. \nThe reign of wants is by no means the \nreign of brotherhood. Let your needs rule \nyou, and you will soon see them multiply \nlike insects in the sun.\"\n\nDoes not this thought come home to most \nof us in our increasing passion to possess \nthis and that thing for which we have no \nneed or use? How many ribbons, laces, \nfeathers, silken fabrics and shining things \nmiscalled jewelry, we think we must have.  \nThe best part of many a woman's life is \nconsumed in chasing after these things \nthat vanity, and certain ambition demand. \n\"There is no such thing as one bit of foolishness, \none vanity or envy. They come \nin pairs and groups. They obscure real \nbeauty and heighten the ugliness that borrows\nthem for mere imitation.\" But this sort \nof thing has nothing to do with those things \nthat administer to our sense or refinement. \nThe man or woman of simple taste is the \nman or woman who appreciates whatever is\ntrue, beautiful and good. Whatever vanity \ndesires is too dear, but whatever our sense \nof the beautiful craves is cheap at any \nprice. \n\nWhen we are subject to the tyranny of \nwants, we miss the joys of real companionship \nand the inspiration there is in doing \nfor others, \"for the more things a man \ndesires, the less he can do for his neighbors.\"\n\nBut Pastor Wagner is not an ascetic. \nThis simple life does not mean a life without \npleasure and color and joy. \n\n\"Pleasure,\" he says. \"is a sacred flame \nthat throws a splendid radiance over life.\"", "69", 125, 125, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00596", "RACE ATTITUDES IN CHILDREN\n\nI.

On the right hand, as you entered\nthe house, stood a six-foot hat rack with\nmirror attached, and just beyond on the\nsame side, was a door which entered the\nspare or company bed-room, which at that\ntime was occupied by Nathan Strogoff. In\nfront of the hat rack, a door open into\nthe parlor, and this parlor was connected\nwith the dining-room by means of old-time\nfolding doors.  The dining-room was also\nused as a kind of sitting room or living\nroom by the Cranstons.\nWhen Stuyvesant left Strogoff he found\nUncle Zeke in the hall, bowing and smiling.\nHe chatted with the old Negro a few minutes.\nPerhaps Uncle Zeke had some message \nfrom Mrs. Cranston or Louisa.  I am \nnot certain that he did have such a message, \nbut the reader will agree that it is\nentirely within the range of possibility.\nStuyvesant places a piece of paper money\nin Uncle Zeke's hand, and the old man,\nwith a bow and a broad grin, turned to the\nhat rack to get Stuyvesant's hat and cane.\nAt that moment the front door opened\nand in stepped Ned Cranston.\n\"Get out of this house, you cur,\"\nblurted out Ned Cranston, addressing\nCharles Stuyvesant.  \"Get out this\ninstant; clear out from here, and, if you \never enter this house again, you do so at the \nperil of your life!\" \n\"All I ask is a square deal,\" said Stuyvesant\ncalmly.\n\"You ought to be shot,\" said Cranston.\n\"Speak again, and I'll kill you!\"\nOut came Ned's pistol.  Uncle Zeke\ncaught the pistol in one hand, and his\nyoung master in the other, and called out:\n\"Don't kill him, Marse Ned;  he ain't\ndone nothin'.\"", "74", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00081", "172     THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO\n\n\"Get out,\" said Ned to Stuyvesant, who\nhad also drawn his pistol.  \"Get out and\ndon't you ever foot this house again!\"\nStuyvesant backed slowly out of the\ndoor, and turning, marched down the steps.\nDuring the excitement in the hall, the\nparlor door had been thrown open.  When\nUncle Zeke had succeeded in getting Ned\n Cranston to put his pistol back in his\npocket, they entered the parlor.\nIn one corner stood Louisa Cranston,\ncrouching and shivering in abject fear, and\non the floor, stretched out at full length,\njust inside the half-opened door, lay the\nrigid form of poor old Mrs. Cranston.\n\nCHAPTER VI.\nA MOTHER'S LAST APPEAL.\n\nIt was Uncle Zeke, with his strong black\narms, who raised Mrs. Cranston tenderly\nfrom the floor and placed her upon the old-fashioned\nsofa in the parlor;  it was Uncle\nZeke who rushed for water, and motioned\nto Louisa to sprinkle it over her mother's \nface;  and it was Uncle Zeke who, a few\nminutes later, almost out of breath and\nwill wildly-staring eyes, stood in Dr. Coe's\noffice exclaiming: \n\"Ef you please, sah, hurry doctah! \nMrase Ned 'lows dat Ole Miss is a-dyin'.\nDo please, doctah, go quick--maybe you\nkin save her!\"\nDr. Coe reached the Cranston homestead \nwithout delay.\n\"She'll hardly pull through this attack,\"\nhe said gravely, as he turned from the hasty\ndiagnosis to face Ned Cranston, who stood\nclose by.\nNed looked towards his sister.  In her\nface he saw only answering sorrow, and\nthen Ned's own pent-up fountain of tears\nopened.  He threw himself on the bed\nbeside his mother, hid his face, and sobbed\naloud.  Louisa swooned, and kind friends\ncarried her from the room.\n\"Bear up, my boy,\" said Dr. Coe.\nLong years of faithful service had \n\nendeared Dr. Coe to the Cranston household.\nNext to blood relations, closer even\nthan the preachers themselves, stand the\nold-time Southern family doctors in the\naffections and confidence of the average\nSouthern family.  Dr. Coe had been in\nattendance at the death of Captain Cranston\nmany years before, and now in his old age\nhe was standing by the death-bed of the\ncaptain's widow. \n\"Bear up, my boy,\" he said soothingly.\n\"Only God can help you in such a time as\nthis.\"\n\"Doctor,\" asked Ned, \"will my mother\nnever speak again?\"\n\"Perhaps--perhaps,\" was the dreary\nanswer, \"but her heart is too weak, I'm\nafraid, to tide over this sudden shock.\" \nTowards sunset, after four or five hours\nof earnest effort on the part of Dr. Coe and\nhis assistants, during which time the\nstricken woman remained for the most part\nunconscious, there were faint and fitful\nevidences of returning consciousness.  Mrs.\nCranston opened her eyes wearily, and\nwearily she closed them again.  By and by \nshe opened her eyes once more.  She\nappeared to be looking around, but there\nwas in her eyes that strange, not-to-be-mistaken,\nfar-off look which belongs only to the \nparting soul when little by little, little \nby little, the prec.ous strength is ebbing\naway almost unnoticed, like the sands in\nan hour-glass.\n\"Ned,\" she said painfully.\nNed caught her feeble hand and kissed\nher pallid lips.\n\"He was innocent,\" continued Mrs.\nCranston, striving hard to make herself\nheard, \"--he was innocent!\"  And the\nwatchers around the bedside thought that\nher mind was wandering.  \"Innocent,\"\nshe repeated.  Then she asked, \"Where's\nLouisa?\"\nIn a few moments Louisa entered the\nmelancholy chamber.  Though every one\nmoved about with as little noise as possible,\n\n\nTHE WELDING OF THE LINK     173\n\nshutting the doors behind them cautiously,\nit seemed that Mrs. Cranston heard Louisa's\nfootsteps in the hall, for when the grief-stricken\nyoung woman entered the room\nher mother's eyes were wide open, eagerly\nlooking towards the door.\nThe dying woman motioned the watchers\nto leave the room.  Only Dr. Coe and the\nnurse remained, with the two children. \nThe sun was slowly sinking in the west,\nand its full red light fell upon the couch\nwhere Mrs. Cranston was lying.  Ned still\nheld her hand.  She motioned to Louisa to\nstand by Ned's side.  Louisa obeyed, the\ngreat tears flowing from her eyes.\n\"Ned,\" said Mrs. Cranston laboriously,\n\"I'm going to leave you.  Love your\nsister.  Comfort her.  Don't stand between\nher and Charles Stuyvesant.  My son, the\ngreat lesson of life is tolerance.  The old\nmen fought their battles more than twenty-five\nyears ago.  The majority of them are\nlong since dead and gone.  The younger\ngeneration should forget the old-time bitter\nsectional feeling, and be friendly.  You \nand Charles were both born since the war.\nYou never held any slaves, and Charles\nnever fought against the South.  Why\nshould you hate each other?  I have asked\nGod to give me strength to say it:  the\ngreat lesson of life is tolerance, and I want\nyou to learn it.  Don't oppose Louisa. \nShe loves Charles, and Charles loves her.\nI had longed to live to give them my\nblessing.\"\nNed stood perfectly quiet, but evidently\ndeeply moved.  His mother motioned for\nhim to come to her.  She kissed him, and\nhis pent-up tears burst forth again.\nMrs. Cranston then looked at her daughter.\n\"My daughter,\" she said, \"Ned will\nbe good to you when I'm gone.  Be good\nto him, and love him.  Live to show him\nthat all that is necessary for one to be a\ntrue and loyal Southern woman, and at the\nsame time a Northern man's wife, is to be\nwhole-souled American.\" \n\nLouisa leaned toward the wan and wasted\nform of her dear old mother, and received\na parting kiss.\nJust then Uncle Zeke entered the room,\nclosely followed by the masterful Newfoundland,\nBoss, the pet of the family.\n\"Uncle Zeke,\" said Mrs. Cranston,\nyou've never betrayed a trust.  You were\ntrue to my husband, and you have served\nme and my family faithfully.  I want your\nMarse Ned and Miss Louisa to take care of\nyou and Mammy until you all die.\"\nDr. Coe then motioned to the old Negro\nto leave the room.  But Uncle Zeke looked\nup pitifully and said: \n\"I wants to see the las' er Old Miss;  she\nwuz de be' frien' I had!\"\nMrs. Cranston kept her eyes closed for\nsome little while.  The watchers returned\nto the room, and with them came other\nfriends of the family.  Boss sat on the rug\nin front of the open fire-place, and looked\nwistfully towards the bed.  Uncle Zeke \nstood mournfully in one corner.  Ned had \nsunk on his knees, and was holding his\nmother's hand.  Louisa sat on the bed,\nweeping sorely and calling to heaven for\nmercy.  Dr. Coe had left.\nMrs. Cranston spoke no more for many\nhours.  The twilight deepened into night.\nMrs. Cranston's breathing became more\nand more difficult.  The pillow was taken\nfrom under her head, and she lay low on\nthe sofa, her slender white neck giving\npainful signs of the tragic struggle going\non between life and death.  The night\ndeepened into midnight.  The breathing\ngrew fainter and fainter.  Away by and\nby she tried to speak.  The watchers bent\nforward to catch her words.\n\"The angels,\" she said faintly, \"the\nangels!  I hear them calling!\"\nAbout one o'clock Dr. Coe, who had\nbeen summoned a little before twelve, felt\nof her wrist and, looking up, said: \n\"The end has come.\"\nBut at the last the sweet and patient", "75", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00082", "174     THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO \n\nsoul had slept away so peacefully that the\nwatchers around the bed-side did not know \nwhen she left.\n\nCHAPTER VII.\nWE SHALL BE HAPPY YET.\n\nIt was one o'clock Wednesday morning\nwhen Mrs. Cranston died.  At eight\no'clock that same morning Jim Parker\nwent up to Charles Stuyvesant's room in\nthe Kimball House, Atlanta, carrying a\ncopy of an Atlanta morning newspaper.\nParker, the reader will remember, was the\ncolored hall-boy who had waited on Charles\nStuyvesant the previous year at the Monte\nSano Hotel.  Stuyvesant was so attracted\nby the boy's general deportment and his\nunusual intelligence that he had carried\nhim North with him when the season \nended.\nStuyvesant was alarmed at Parker's early\ncall.  He had told him the night before\nnot to report until nine o'clock the next\nmorning, and this early visit caused Stuyvesant\nto think doubtless that Parker had\nsome special message, or that Strogoff had\ntaken a turn for the worse.\n\"Well, Parker, what's the trouble?\"\nasked Stuyvesant.\n\"Trouble enough, Mr. Stuyvesant,\"\nreplied the valet, and he added quickly,\n\"not about Mr. Strogoff, but it's bad news \njust the same.\"\nWithout further announcement, Parker \nhanded Stuyvesant the paper, and pointed\nto the despatch from Hopewell announcing\nthe death of Mrs. Cranston.\n\"Heaven help me!\" cried Stuyvesant\nwhen he saw it.  \"Can it be possible !\nWhat a lovable woman she was!\"  Tears\nstood in his eyes, as he said, \"Go over at\nonce and tell Mr. Strogoff.  Break the\nnews as gently as possible, and say to him\nI'll be over in a short while.  You wait\nthere for me.\"\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  \nOn his visit to the Cranston home the \n\nday before, Stuyvesant informed Strogoff\nthat he had left Parker in Atlanta with \ninstructions to secure a place in some good\nprivate sanitarium, whither he intended to\ntake Strogoff, if the doctor felt that the \nride of three or four hours might be undertaken\nwithout any very great risk or injury \nto the wounded man.  Strogoff fell in with\nthe plan readily, and when Stuyvesant left \nthe sick room it was with the understanding\nthat he would go immediately and consult\nDr. Coe.  Stuyvesant had just concluded \nhis interview with Dr. Coe, and had\ndescended to the street, when he saw Uncle\nZeke rushing like a madman in the direction\nof the doctor's office.  Stuyvesant's\nhair stood on end.  Instantly he feared\nthat Ned Cranston might have killed\nStrogoff.\n\"What's the matter?\" he called out to\nthe fleet-footed old Negro.  \"Is Mr. Strogoff\nall right?\"\n\"Yas, sah, he's all right ;  but Ole Miss\ndone fainted,\" Uncle Zeke replied.\nStuyvesant paused in the act of getting\ninto his carriage.  Pretty soon Dr. Coe\ncame down in great haste.  As he was\nstepping into his buggy, Stuyvesant said\nto him: \n\"I'll send over for Strogoff in time to\ncatch the four o'clock train.  Please see\nthat he gets started properly.  Sorry you\ncan't go with us.  Hope there's nothing\nserious over there!\"\nThat same night Stuyvesant and Strogoff\nreached Atlanta safely, but it was not\nuntil they were aboard the train and well \non the way that Stuyvesant learned that\nMrs. Cranston was in a most critical condition.\nBut the announcement of her\ndeath, which he saw the next morning,\nwhile it did not come as a complete surprise,\nwas nevertheless a shocking blow to \nhim.\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *  \n\"Well, old, man, what in the name of \n\n\nTHE WELDING OF THE LINK     175\n\nheaven shall we do now?  All our plans\nhave been interrupted.\"  It was with these\nwords, after finding out that Strogoff had\nspent a quiet and restful night, that Stuyvesant\nturned to the question which\nweighed heavily on his mind.\n\"Just be easy--that's all,\" said Nathan\nStrogoff, making a desperate effort to sit up\nin bed.  Then he added, \"What's worth\nhaving is worth not only working for but\nwaiting for as well.\"\n\"Yes, but I have waited.\"\n\"Yet not quite as long as Jacob did!\"\n\"I ought to be with Louisa now,\" said\nStuyvesant, ignoring Strogoff's remark.\n\"My place this moment is at her side.\"\n\"Yes, my young friend, but you know\nthat no two bodies can occupy the same\nplace at the same time, and so no one body\ncan occupy two places at the same time.\"\n\"But didn't you tell me that her mother\nhad consented to our marriage?  And\ndidn't she agree to take Louisa next month\nto the Monte Sano Hotel, so that I might\n\nwed her there?  And now what I have to\nwait until her mother comes back from the\ngrave before I can take Louisa for my\nwife?\"\n\"No, not so long as that, I hope;  but\nyou will agree with me that propriety\ndemands that the marriage should be postponed, \nin view of Mrs. Cranston's death.\nIt sees to me you ought to wait another\nyear at least.\"\n\"Well, ought I to go to Hopewell?\"\nasked Stuyvesant eagerly.\n\"Not today,\" replied Strogoff.  \"There \nis no need of being rash.  Be easy.  Everything\nwill turn out all right.  I think you\nhad better write.  I shouldn't go today, if\nI were you.\"\n\"I'll write and telegraph, too.\"\n\"Just as you like, but don't think of\ngoing to Hopewell today.  Louisa is a sensible\nwoman;  she'll understand.

It reads like the calm, steady, positive\napproach of a great will to do and live.  His life is\nfull of interest--not the sensational kind, but the\nkind that best serves as stimulus to the New\nNegro.\nThe drudgery of slavery, the slave market, the\nlash of the overseer, the midnight escape, the\npatrollers, the recapture, the blood-curdling reprimand,\nthe second escape, the all night tramp\nthrough a black, muddy swamp, cold, hungry,\nnaked, penniless, friendless ;  these were awful,\nhellish experiences, but they are of the past--dead. \nLet that history pass.

Examples of opportunity taken and\nwisely used are what latter day young men need,\nand this is what Dr. DuBois' career is brimful of.\nThis is one of the many reasons why his life is\nworth the telling, if such is possible. \n\nThe effort to relate the desperate upward struggle\nof the man who has everything in his favor is\nhard.

It\nwould be strange, indeed, if at the South such education\nwas not by most people welcomed.  For this\neducation proposes to make of women, better cooks,\nseamstresses, chambermaids and washerwomen ; \nand of me, better brickmasons, carpenters, farmhands \nand general utility laborers.  This is all very\ndesirable, and the South does not need to be told\nso.  But in my opinion industrial education, even\nwith its side-line of a little learning, will, if not\nsafe guarded and undergirded by higher and distinctive\nintellectual training for the race, forge the\nchains of a servitude on the black man from which\nhe will never recover. \nWe should help the Negro to feed, clothe and\nshelter himself and we should give him work and\npay him just wages for it.  But we are not, then,\nat the end of our duty.  A man wants more than\nthis :  for life is other and more than existence,\nand the Negro should have encouragement and\nrecognition in all those high and precious matters\nin which a human being counts life dear unto himself.\nHe should be taught to seek the permanent \nand fundamental rights of man and to waive with\ndignity minor things.  It is not hard to minister to\nhis life.  Let him be fed and clothed and sheltered, \nbut let us kindle within him the hope that one day\nhe shall be free to think and act among us and\nshall be worthy of such liberty.\n\nThe right to complain against injustice\nand the right to vote by the black man upon\nthe original and still operative plan in the \nnation for white men was most aptly put by\nProfessor DuBois in his now famous article\n\" Debit and Credit\" in the VOICE OF THE\nNEGRO for January, 1905.  His eighth\nitem on the credit side of the account contains\nthe milk of the cocoanut as viewed by\nthe overwhelming mass of the Negro race. \nIt is their conviction from the depths of\ntheir heart that--\n\nBy an aroused race consciousness, in the face\nof which it is no longer possible for any Negro to\ndare tell an American audience that the Negroes\nought not to vote until they are perfect, ought not\nto complain of \"Jim Crow\" cars until they own\nrailroads, or that they ought not to go to college\nuntil they are rich.\n\nWe can do no better than to call attention\nto the closing paragraph in our editorial in \n\nthe January issue as expressive of our view\nof the erroneous policy that seeks to reduce\na man to an automaton by prostituting his\ndivine faculties of imagination, love of truth,\nvision, faith, intellect, conscience and his irresistible\ndesire for immortality into a trained\nbut mechanical machine for breadwinning. \nWe also call attention to the fact that a race\nthat spends its vital force in trying to catch\nup with another race has not grasped the\nsignificance of its existence and is doomed\nto a dwarfed racial development.\n\nTo hold up before any race the idea of overtaking\nanother race or of trying to make itself acceptable\nto another one, is a false idea of life and leads\nto a perversion of the truth of its existence and to\na mistaken policy in life.\nThis race must be taught that its chief business\nis not to make money or try to catch up with any\nother race.  Its chief duty is the cultivation of\ncharacter.  Money is not the ruling factor of the\nworld.  True, it is an essential in life and its possession\nindicated a type of character.  But it is now\nthe ruler of kingdoms and the director of destinies.\nIn the face of the fact that this race is not rich in\nthis world's good, the writer is bold enough to\ndeclare that character is greater than gold ; that\nour sorest need is that element that eludes troy\nweight and refuses to be measured in the gross\nscales of avoirdupois and scorns the statistical columns\nof the census report and is too large for a \nbanker's vault.\n\nIt may be politic at times not to state the\nwhole truth, but it can never be right to\nmisstate the truth.  The Negro race can\nafford to wait that right may triumph.  It\nis a patient race.  It waited once for a few\ncenturies and right triumphed, and it will \nwait again, but it will never consent in silence\nto a wrong statement as to its purpose and\nplans, or to a statement so wide of the true \nprinciples as are stated by Mr. Washington's\npusillanimous speech mad in Philadelphia. \nFor--\n\n\"Right is right since God is God,\nAnd right the day must win ;\nTo doubt would be disloyalty,\nTo falter would be sin.\" \n\n\nIN THE SANCTUM     197\n\nOur Advertisers \n\nWe wish to say to our readers that all of\nthe firms that advertise with us are reliable\nso far as we know.

When visiting\nor writing a firm which advertises with us\nyou will help us by mentioning the fact that\nthe advertisement in our magazine was the\ncause of your attention being directed to\nthem.\n________\nNotice\n\nSome of the things announced in the last\nnumber of the VOICE for this month do not\nappear for lack of space and for the reason\nthat events that are of pressing public\ninterest to the race and to the world have \ntaken place and had to be discussed.  The \n\nVOICE OF THE NEGRO is an illuminating\nand comprehensive history of the times and\nhas to give to our subscribers an interpretation\nof the events of today, even at the\nsacrifice of high class papers that appear to\nbe less suited to our readers.\n________\nThe Eastern Conflict\n\nTO THE EDITOR VOICE OF THE NEGRO : \nI was first apprised of your wonderful magazine\nby the editor of the Boston Guardian.  I have\nread with pleasure many of its well discussed\narticles.  Were I permanently located, I would subscribe \nat once from the office direct.  But I intend,\nso long as it pursues its present course, to secure\nit from the newsstands and read every single issue.\nBut I do depreciate to some degree the attitude\nof the VOICE as regards the war in the far East.\nYou and I see the war from a different point of view. \nI agree that the Japanese fall in the color\nline, and, under natural Japanese impulses, I\nshould rejoice to note and proclaim Japanese victory. \nBut from all that I can gather in reading of\nthe war, Japan is wholly actuated by England.\nEngland has moulded the bullet and Japan is doing\nthe shooting.  England holds an unmitigating\ngrudge against Russia--a fear and feeling that she\ndare not attempt to avenge openly and personally. \nA victory for Japan means nothing more or less\nthan an Anglo-Saxon victory.  Their press and\npurse are not open to the whooping-up of Japan for\nnothing.  As a nation, if Japan was defending her\nown integrity, I for one would rejoice in the\ntriumph of Japanese arms.  But sorry to see and\nsay, like most darker races, this race is being used\nby the white man or shrewd Saxon.  England\nfears Russia's Asiatic development lest she loses\nher East India and other possessions.  Your new\nphrase, \"Nitschevo,\" hardly applies to a great\npeople like Russia, any more than your term \"all\nright\" applies to the English stock.  Russia\nmight as truthfully say as many mean things of\nAmerican concerning its treatment of the colored\npopulation.  If all manner of public fraud and\nmob violence too shameful for public mention\nmean \"all right\" for English stock, then go \nahead.  Otherwise, pause and think, for God's\nsake.  It is grand to take up these foreign public\nquestions, but let us see them through Negro\ninstead of white man's glasses. \nPlease excuse me.\nYours for the right,\nGRANVILLE MARTIN.\nIn answer to Mr. Martin's spicy letter, \n\n", "87", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00096", "READ THIS\nTHE PRESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES\nA BEAUTIFUL PICTURE in two colors, 20x28 inches, on heavy cardboard.

This is one of the many subjects pertaining to the work\nwell done by a single group about which [there is] practically nothing has been written\nand about which the public is bound to remain in the densest ignorance intil\nthese interesting facts are published. I felt well repaid for my research. I was amazed at the first-hand information\nI was able to glean about the work which colored women did for the church in\nin the early days of this country's history , long before the emancipation\nof slaves. [*First church established by Col women in Providence.*]\nWhile I was in Atlanta filling this engagement for Dr. Dubois I received\na telegram from Dr. Booker T. Washington saying that he wanted me to come\nto the Tuskegee Commencement, remain two days and he would defray my rail\nroad expenses from Atlanta and return. [It was] At that time the most acrimonious dis\ndiscussions were engaged in by the two divsions in our group, [the race]- the one favoring\nthe higher education of the race and the other industrial training.\nDfr. Dubois was the High Priest of Higher Education and Dr. Booker Washington\nwas the champion and recognized spokesman for industrial training. While\nI appreciated the efforts exerted by Dr. Washington to train the masses of\nthe race efficiently to earn their living, I also believed in higher education\nfor as many of the race as could possibly secure it just as ardently as\ndid Dr. Dubois. In Washington, particularly did the arguments pro and con\nwax very hot. Now that I was invited to Tuskegee by the founder at his expense\nnaturally I cheerfully consented to accept it\nThe invitation [extended] to visit Tuskegee about which I had heard so much\ngood, bad and indifferent seemed almost providential to me and I accepted\nit with the keenest anticipation of pleasure. At last I would see for myself\nwhat this much-discussed school was like. I had never seen a Commencement \nlike the one at Tuskegee [it] before. Students actually did their stunts before the assembled multitude.\nThey showed us how to build houses, how to paint them, how to estimate [what the] \nwhat the paint would cost and so on down the line/(Look at my article on\nTuskegee which appeared in the Post.) I was taken completely off my feet. I was\na convert with all my heart, soul, mind and strength. Here was a school giving\njust the kind of instruction that the majority of the pupils attending\nit needed. Owing to the lessons inculcated in slavery neither the white\npeople nor the colored people of the South knew any more about injecting\nsystem into their work or making accurate calculations than they should.\nSo these students at Tuskegee woul make a good beginning in the right direction", "24", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00098", "Don't You Want a Race History?\n\nThe Negro in Business and he Professions\n\nThe Colored Woman and Her Social Standing\n\n\"THE PROGRESS OF A RACE\" \nTHE ONLY BOOK THAT CONTAINS FULL\nAND UP-TO-DATE RACE STATISTICS\n\nIT TELLS YOU\nHow many colored people there are in the United States ; how many in each\nState ; how many in each county in all the Southern States and in other States\nhaving any considerable number of Negroes,\n\nFrom Special Statistical Tables You Can See at a Glance\nHow many Negroes own homes;  how many schools there are for Negroes; how\nmany teachers and scholars;  how many colleges and professional schools there \nare for Negroes; how many churches and church papers; the estimated value of\nNegro church property, and also the total value of property held by the race; \nhow many own farms; how many own homes and how many are tenants; \nhow many colored persons are lawyers, how many doctors; how\nmany are engaged in agriculture; how many in domestic service; how\nmany in trade, transportation and manufacturing.\n\n1860\nA Slave.\n1870\nOne-mule farmer.\n1880\nTwo-mule farmer,\nOwning some land\n1890\nTen mules, two cows,\nTwo hundred acres of land.\n1900\nFifty head of stock,\nFive hundred acres of land,\nBoys in college,\nBoys owning farms,\nDaughters teaching,\nDaughters keeping neat homes\nof their own\n=====\nNOTE.--The above is the history\nof one colored man--it is the\nhistory of one thousand today.\n=====\nDon't Fail to Get a Copy of the\nBook and Rad for Yourself\n\nSpecial Collection of Plantation Melodies\nWill be of unusual interest not only to the colored [re]ader, but to all\nwho see them.

The President, R. R. Robinson, being keen in \nthought and foresight, saw the growing desire of the colored people all over this country to buy stock \nand become a part of its owner, and knowing as he did that the old company would not sell its stock to \nthe masses of the people, decided to enter into an arrangement with the stockholders to purchase their \ninterest and put same into the new company and enlarge its capitalization, putting the par value of the  \nstock down from $5.00 to $1.00 per share, so that the poor as well as the rich could buy. These plans \nwere agreed upon and carried out, hence the colored people may now continue to own their own road. \nThese shares, as fast as possible, the company desires to dispose of, so as to enable them to extend and \ncomplete two and a half miles more of their road, through a thickly populated territory, which have \nbeen granted to them by the city. When this is done, they will have seven miles of solid road in operation. \nIts affairs are in safe hands; their greatest hope is to make it a paying investment to its stockholders. \nLet the colored people come to the rescue of this foremost and growing enterprise. You can \ntake from one dollar up to ten thousand dollars of shares in it. Remember the shares are $1.00 per \nshare. You may subscribe for as many as you like, and pay 20 percent of your subscription in cash, balance \nweekly or monthly until you shall have paid out: then the company will take up your receipt and\nissue your stock upon it. \n\nTHE COMPANY'S PROPERTY  \nTwo franchises in the City of Jacksonville................................$100,000\nOne in County to Spring.....................................................................50,000\nForty Acres Park Pavillion and Outhouse.....................................15,000\nFour Cars, value......................................................................................28,000\nFour and one-half Miles of Road in Operation, value.............60,000\nTotal Bonded Indebtedness...............................................................86,000\n\nCapital Stock of the Atlantic-Pacific Street Railway and Surety Company.\n\nAddress all your applications to the President Atlantic-Pacific Street Railway and Surety Company, \nJacksonville, Fla. \n", "97", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00102", "The Voice of the Negro\nFor May, 1905\nWe invite our readers to take a peep into the Sanctum with us and see what\nwe are planning for their enjoyment next month.

GRIMKE, is a very able paper from the pen of\na very able writer and lawyer.  Mr. GRIMKE'S article is short, but powerful. \nThe writer is thoroughly conversant with the origin and history of popular governments,\nand registers a strong indictment against Southern disfranchisement.\n\nThe Attitude of the Intelligent Negro Towards Lynchings\nThis is the title of a very comprehensive paper by KELLY MILLER, which will\nbe published in the May number of our magazine.  Mr. MILLER has made a\nname for himself as a brilliant epigrammatic writer.  You can always depend\nupon reading something fascinating when KELLY MILLER writes.  In this paper\nhe has made a very careful study of the general subject of lynching and gives to\nthe world the colored man's mind on the subject.  This paper should be read\nwith intense interest by both races  It states the black man's case clearly and\ncomprehensively, while it refutes the dogmas of many of our white friends as\nregards the Negro's attitude toward crime and its punishment.  This paper was\ncrowded out of this number because of lack of space.\n\nThe New Education.\nThis is a  powerful poem by BENJAMIN GRIFFITH BRAWLEY.  Mr. BRAWLEY \nseverely scores the materialistic tendency of the age.  He makes a powerful plea\nfor the same thing for which Mr. ROOSEVELT plead in a speech a few days ago\n--\"The things of the soul.\"  Mr. BRAWLEY vividly recited the fact that men of\ntoday are degenerating in their tastes.  He wails that \"Homer is a worn-out\nsong.\"  He registers a strong indictment against the sordid age when he says :\n\"And now a people with a zeal\nFor things that they can make and see,\nForget the lyric trance to feel\nAnd hear but the anvil's clank and plea; \nAnd now the heart's most sacred tone\nIs sacrificed to wood and stone.\"\n\nThe Southern Conspiracy\nIs one of a series of short stories we are going to publish this summer.  A young \nman whose father has done much in the literary world, and who himself is destined\nto become a great writer and author, writes \"A Southern Conspiracy.\"\nHe does not care to have his name divulged at this stage and so he writes under\nthe pseudonym of \"H.\"  \"H.\" has given us a charming and exciting short\nstory in which he boldly uncovers the existence of a great Southern newspaper\nconspiracy to corrupt the northern public mind on the race question.  \"H.\" has\nbeen taking lessons under \"M.

Our privileges\ncarry with them corresponding responsibilities.\n3.  Let us apply the golden rule\nin dealing with all men.  4.  The United\nStates is at present the cynosure of all eyes,\nand our experiment in conducting a republican\ndemocratic government will have a\nmighty influence upon the problems of\nmankind.  5.  We must stick to the lofty\nideals of the fathers, for only thus shall we\nbe able to succeed in handing down to our\nchildren a heritage of which they and their\nchildren will be proud.  Just before the\naddress an inspiring and impressive scene\nwas witnessed.  The President, with uncovered\nhead, stood on the raised platform\nbefore a vast throng of his fellow-citizens\nand repeated the simple oath of office after\nthe aged and venerable Chief Justice of the\nUnited States Supreme Court.  When he\nhad finished repeating the oath, he bowed\nhis head slowly and reverently and kissed\nthe open Bible.  The vast multitude burst\nforth into thunderous applause.  Theodore\nRoosevelt had sworn to protect and defend\nthe constitution of the country, and was\nnow the twenty-sixth President of the\nUnited States of America.  In the grand\nparade which then proceeded down Pennsylvania\navenue, every race that is now\nsheltered by our flag was represented.\nEvery phase of national life could be discerned.\nFor the first time in the history\nof our country, the islands of the sea \nhelped to inaugurate a President of the \nUnited States.  Squadron \"A\" of the New \nYork troops led the Presidential cavalcade.\nThe parade lasted over four hours and was\nthe most picturesque that was ever seen in\nWashington.  The Filipino scouts and the\ngallant Ninth cavalry, colored, both attracted\na great deal of attention in the\nparade.  Through a long land of cheering\nhumanity the gaudy pageant, with its\nbewildering profusion of gold braid and\nfanfare of trumpets, passed down the most \n\nfamous parade ground in the world, and\nthe most brilliant, the most jaunt, and probably\nthe wisest President the country has\never had was inaugurated.\n__________\nThe New Administration: \nIts Policies Forecasted \nThe American \npeople are fortunate\nin having\nfor President a man who has been\nweighed in the balances and who measures\nup to the standard of a statesman of the\nfirst magnitude.  Mr. Roosevelt is no\nstranger in American politics.  He has\nbeen in public life almost since the day of\nhis graduation from college.  He has served\nin the New York State Legislature ;  he was\nonce at the head of the police force of New \nYork City ;  he was once the assistant secretary\nof the navy ;  he has fought on the\nbattlefield for his country ;   as Vice-President,\nhe has worked in the United States\nSenate ;  and now for three years he has\noccupied the Presidential chair.  His record\nis open to inspection and has already been\npronounced untainted by nearly eight million\nvoters.  Others of his countrymen\nrefused him this tribute because of partisanship.\nMr. Roosevelt's record in all of \nthese years is one of consistency, and,\ntherefore, we may, with some degree of\ncertainty, give to the public a forecast of\nsome of the things that he will insist upon \nwhile he is President.  1.  In the first place,\nin administering the affairs of the government \nthe President will not make what we\nmay call a good Republican President ;  i.\ne., he will not confine himself to the narrower\nlimitations of partisanship in recommending\nmeasure and in appointing officers.  \nHe is a man of ideals, and will pursue\nthose ideals whether they show themselves \nin one party or the other.  2.  In\ndealing with the race question, Mr. Roosevelt\nwill stick to his motto, \"All men up,\nand not some men down.\"  He will insist\nthat justice and fair-play be granted the\ncolored people as the white people.

For many years colored women had been banding together in\nthe interest of the church and had done very effective work in various ways.\nBut secular organizations among them were comparitively rare. As soon as the\nidea of uniting their forces outside of the church dawned upon them, it took\ndefinite, tangible form quickly and women of all classes and conditions seized\nupon it with enthusiasm.\nIn Washington, D.C., where there were probably more colored women who had\nenjoyed educational advantages than in any other one city in the country, this\nwas especially true. A goodly number of these women decided to band together to\nraise the standard of their group and the Colored Women's League was formed in\n1892. [*?*] They resolved \"That the colored women of the United States associate ourselves\ntogether to collect all facts obtainable showing the moral, intellectual\nindustrial and social growth and attainments of our people; to foster unity of\npurpose; to consider and determine methods which will promote the best interests\nof the colored people in any direction that suggests itself.\"\nAmong other things the League established a sort of Night School on a \nsmall scale. Classes in various subjects were offered. As Chairman of the Educational\nCommittee I gave my services gratuitously to teach a class in English\nLiterature and one in German several nights a week. A goodly number availed\nthemselves of this opportunity and the students were asked to pay ten cents a\nlesson, so as to help defray the expenses of lighting and heating the Y.M.C.A.\nwhere we met. There were classes in sewing also and in other industrial arts.\nMeantime in Boston a club of progressive colored women was formed, whose\npurposes and aims were similar to those of the League. Each one of these organizations\n[Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin of that city called together]\ngrew apace and enlarged its sphere of influence more and more. \nIn the summer of 1895 women from various \nstates met in Boston at the call of Mrs. Josephine St. Pierre Ruffin and\nthe Federation of the Afro-American Women was formed [with Mrs. Booker T Washington as President]. In the meantime however, \n[both] clubs outside of Washington had already become affiliates \nwith the League.\nThere were then two national organizations of colored women and soon a dispute arose as to\nwhich was the first to becomre actually national in scope and later on the\nquestion was raised as to which one had more clubs affiliated with it than the\n", "39", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00114", "Southern Negro in Northern University \nBy Wm. Pickens\n\nThe American Negro seems on the higher \nverge of an Educational Renaissance; the \n\"dark ages\" of materialism have had their\ndecade. Many are looking forward to \nfurther their education in better institutions \nthan the South can at present afford to \nthem. A word to these ambitious young is \nappropriate.\n\nIt is important that the young Negro \nfrom the South, who is about to enter Yale \nor Harvard, should not be handicapped by \nwrong expectations and presuppositions. \nLet him remember that he is simply going \nfrom one part to another part of the same \nsociety, whose respective practices, though \nsomewhat different, have much the same \ntheories at bottom. Yes, his whole case is \nto be proven; not a single presumption will \nlie in his favor, neither as to scholarship \nnor character. It is as if the defendant has \nentered court with every presumption on \nthe side of the accuser. In the Southern \ncollege from which he came his very membership\nin the \"college family\"demanded \ncertain favorable judgment from those about \nhim. But in this new environment both \nprofessors and students, in spite of reason \nand in spite of themselves, eye him with a \ndistant curiosity. What doeth this man \nhere? He is not of us; he has entered \nhigh in his class, to be sure, but has not \nevery \"wise\" white man and every \"level\nheaded\" Negro in the land declared that no \nblack man should darken the threshold of \nhigher learning until the whole race has \nsome wealth and a high type of character? It \ndoes not occur to them that it is equally \nreasonable to say: No boy can touch \nwater till the majority can swim, and none \nshould see ice till all can skate. \n\nThe Negro must stand alone and prove\nhis case; his highest need is a levelhead \nand a good fund of common sense. \n\nLast year there were about thirty Negro\nstudents at Harvard, and about half as \nmany at Yale. The great majority were \nfrom the South and most of them self-supporting. \nTheir average scholarship would \nbe a good way above the average for the \nwhite students, for the Negroes represent \nthe brighter and more energetic section of \ntheir race. \n\nThose who have come from the South and\nwho have gone as high as possible in Southern \ninstitutions, have the advantage in \nalmost every way over those who were educated \nin the North or who went thither \nearly in their educational career. The \nSoutherner is more scholarly, for the \nabsence of certain industrial opportunities \nin the North is peculiarly detrimental to \nthe ambition of her average Negro citizen. \nAs a rule the Southerner is more level-\nheaded; for in the environment from which \nhe came, opposition was pronounced and \nunambiguous, and he is not easily deceived \nby a superficial show of courtesies; while \nthe very inconsistency between the social \nand industrial life of his Northern brother \nhas kept him in a state of vacillation - he \nhas never come into equilibrium with his \nenvironment, never found \"just where he's \nat.\" Consequently he has less pertinacity, \nless capacity for resistance in the same \nstraight line. Both will be subject to many \npetty slights and snubs. The Northerner \nwill be unbalanced, overcome - will lose his \nhead and lose the battle. But the Southerner\nhas a coal of mail which sheds all \npetty thrust as the eagle's wing sheds raindrops -\nabsolutely ignoring them. \n\nEre long he finds that he has not an ounce \n\n\nSOUTHERN NEGRO IN NORTHERN UNIVERSITY          235\n\nmore of opposition in the white students \nfrom the South than from those of the North. \nBut he will find the Southern white more \nfrank, and the Northern white more secretive;\nthe Southerner more subject to feeling, \nthe Northern more subject to law. The\nSouthern whites will divide themselves into \nthree well defined classes: a few who are \n\"self-opinioned\" enough to be the colored \nstudent's best friends; some who are small\nenough to fit into the pettiest schemes for his \ndiscomfiture; and others who are magnanimous \nenough to neither help nor hinder, love \nnor hate. But the Northern whites, though\nthey may be at heart subject to just such a \nclassification, have nevertheless such a sense\nof formal justice and are so habituated to\nexternal obedience to law, as to appear uniform.\nBut when the final test comes and\nhe is forced to his position, the Northerner\nshows his colors with all the enthusiasm of\nlong repressed feeling.  The \"Southernized\"\nYankee has become famous.\n     I repeat that in such surroundings the\nblack man's most valuable possession is a \nlevelhead.  If he has enemies he will find\nthe very first thing they desire is to make\nhim mad.  \"Whom the gods would destroy\nthey first make mad;\" and I know not\nwhether it is true that men have been cunning\nenough to copy this strategem of the\ngods, or that they have been audacious\nenough to impute to the gods a wickedness\nwhich men always possessed.  The contestant\nhas a vantage when his opponent gets\nmad.\n     I have seen a Negro boy enter a Northern\nuniversity under the very acme of all the\ndisadvantages at which I  have hinted, and\nby a dignified contempt for littleness, never\nsacrificing one tittle of respect by toadying,\nindomitable in his persistence, insistence\nand resistence wherever needed, reach his\ngoal.  If he entered a class-room and the\nseat on his right and the one on his left were\nvacated, he coolly put his hat into one and\npiled his book into the other, and as a result\nof abundant room and the lack of encumberment\nhe would be the only man to complete\nthe examination or the written recitation\nwithin the required time.  Within \nthree months every seat in his neighborhood\nwas filled, not for the love of his company,\nbut for the convenience of a glance at the \npaper on which he wrote.  He had an object\nwhen he matriculated; that object was not\nsocial preferment.\n     As to whether a man is loved, depends\nmuch upon the lover; as to whether he is\nrespected, depends absolutely upon himself.\nOne can force no man to love him; he can\ncompel every man to respect him.  A man\ncan have the highest respect for whom he\nhas the intensest hate.  I have heard white\nboys in a Northern college begging a black\nboy to be their tutor; I have known them\nto acknowledge, among themselves, the excellence\nof his scholarship and the irreproachableness of his character; and then\nuse all their influence against his advancement\nto certain honors.  Yea, I have heard\nthem praise him with an oath.  That is an\nunnatural state of things; it is the war of\ntwo opposite elements - and the right will \nwin.\n     Looked at from the other end, some of the\n\"disadvantages\" of the Negro university\nstudent are opportunities.  Disadvantage\novercome is doubly advantageous.  It is\nnot wholly against him that he is presumed\nto be a fool when he is first met.  It is as\nif he were in a contest and his antagonist\nhad greatly underestimated his strength.\nHence the complete rout of his enemy and\nthe universal sensation, if he is extraordinarily\nstrong.\n      Because of the great advantage of a training\nin Southern life for any Negro who expects\nto accomplish anything in the United\nStates of America, I have often tried to persuade\nNorthern Negroes to send their children\nto the South for at least a part of their\neducation.  But most Northern blacks has\na natural horror for \"the land of cotton", "108", 125, 125, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00631", "#2\n\nAfter you have worn the coat a full week, if you like it so well that you don't \nwant to part with it, you can send me -- not $25, the real value of such a raincoat \n-- but my Introductory Price on these first new coats -- only $17.85.\n\nIf for any reason, you should not wish to keep the raincoat, after a full\nweek's wear, simply send it back, and accept my thanks for the privilege of\ndemonstration.\n\nMy reason for making this remarkable offer is simply to introduce these desirable\nraincoats to a few representative men in the larger cities (like Washington) as\nquickly as possible, and to make you so enthusiastic about your own coat that you\nwill show it to other men.\n\nI have had my stenographer enclose a Special Privilege post-card.

It was apparent to the thoughtful women of our\ngroup that there would be very little likelihood of two national organizations achieving\nsuccess at that stage of their development. Among these [thoughtful] women therefore, it was the\nconsensus of opinion that only one natiojal organization was needed. After converting \na sufficient number to this point of view it was decided to merge the\ntwo organizations into one.\nTo effect this union a Committee of 7 was appointed from the League and 7\nfrom the Federation of which I was one.  On July - the 1st day the Afro-Amer Federation's 2nd Con This Joint Committee elected me Chairman\nand immediately proceeded to discuss the terms on which we could unite with justice\nto each organization . Considering the difficulties encountered this was accomplished\nwith comparatively little friction..\nWhat should the child of this union be called? That was indeed the question\nIt was decided to have the name of neither of the former organizations appear.\nIt should therefore be neither a League nor a Federation. After considerable debate\nit was decided to call the new organization The National Association\nof Colored Women, the name under which it was incorporated in St. Louis in\n1904 and which it will continue to bear till the end of time, I hope.\nAnd then the most difficult task of all [was encountered or] [presented itself] confronted us. Who should\nbe the first president of the new assoc? That was indeed the question. It is safe to assert that\nwhile we were in the throes of electing the pres the name of no colored woman who had achieved prominence of any kind anywhere in \nthe United States failed to be presented for consideration. The name of practically\nevery woman in the room at the time who was a member of the Joint Committee was also mentioned\nfor the office, not only once but several times. When a member of this Committee\nwas nominated, the result of the poll usually showed that every woman\non her half of the Joint Committee voted for her, while every woman on the\nother half cast her vote for somebody else. Over and over again the teller\nwould report that Miss A had 7 votes and Miss B had seven, and this went on indefinitely,\nuntil most of us had little hope that anybody in the United States\nor out of it could ever be elected. Finally I was nominated for the second time\nduring the day, [broke] the dead lock was broken I received the majority of the votes cast\nand was elected first president of the National Association of Colored Women. Like the other members of the Joint Com I had been nom and had met the same fate as the others.

There were 145 delegates- a\nlarge number for that time. In addition to an unusually interesting program, fin\nspeakers, the active participation of the most distinguished colored women in the United States\nand crowded houses both day and night, the newspapers of Chicago gave the Asso\nciation more publicity than it has ever received from the press of any other city\nin which we have since met.

His opening words may well be\npondered by all interested in the progress\nof the races : \n\nAt the opening of this the fourth annual session\nof the Tuskegee Negro Conference, we can point\nto many evidences of real progress as a result of\nthese annual gatherings.\nCalmness and confidence are powerful factors in\nthe progress of a race as well as in that of an individual.\nThe work accomplished by this organization\nwith its numerous ramifications, should convince\nus that the policy for the race to pursue, is\nto continue its course of seeking quietly, patiently\nand courageously after the essentials of life.  We\nshould more and more accustom ourselves to be\nunspoiled by praise or discouraged by blame.\nOne definite success in a given direction will\noften go farther in the solution of perplexing\nproblems than all the orations and glittering genrealities\nthat can be summoned to plead our cause.\nIn the last analysis, the world judges a race by its\nability to show definite results of progress, by its\nability to achieve the highest usefulness.  With\nsuch evidence of progress always present, no untoward \ninfluence can permanently hold a people\nback ; without such evidence no amount of artificial\nstimulation can push a people permanently\nforward.  Material possessions should not be sought\nas an end but as a means to help us forward toward \nhigh moral and religious living.  When a race \nowns land and houses and has a bank account,\nthese possessions indicate that that race has learned\nto make sacrifices, to do without today that is may\npossess tomorrow ; has learned to look ahead and\nplan for the future.  When a man becomes the\nowner of a piece of property and a taxpayer in his\ncommunity, as a rule there comes to him added\nself-respect and added confidence from his neighbors.\n*  *  *  \nThe increased amount of property which we are\nholding and paying taxes upon shows that we have\nnot become discouraged or disheartened as a race,\nbut that we have confidence in ourselves and the\nfuture.\nNo community is safe when there is more ignorance\nthan intelligence in it.  One farmer cannot\nbe ignorant without that ignorance affecting his\nneighbors.  No community should be contented\nuntil it possesses a first-class, comfortable schoolhouse,\nhas a school term lasting at least six or seven\nmonths, with a first-class teacher.  *  *  *  \nIt is an encouraging and noteworthy fact that the\nproperty holding, intelligent and educated classes\nof our people rarely are guilty of crime or charged\nwith crime, and it is equally encouraging to note \n\nthat as intelligence increases immorality deceases. \nWe should be very careful in every community to\ndraw the line between the good and the bad, the\nvicious and the virtuous, and we should demand\nthe very strictest and highest standards of living,\non the part of our leaders.\nFinally, we should not fail to cultivate pride of\nrace.  We should let the world know that we are\nproud of belonging to the Negro race, that we\ncount it no more a disgrace to be classed as a Negro\nthan we would to be classed as member of any\nother race.  We should teach our children to have\nfaith in the race to which we belong and have love\nand respect for it, and above all things to have\nfaith in the future.  No race that does not believe in\nitself and respect itself can expect to command\nthe confidence of others.\nNeither should we omit any opportunity to cultivate\nthe friendship of the man who is our next door\nneighbor, whatever his color or race.  In all the\nreal things of life it is our neighbor who can be of\nthe most service to us in our efforts to achieve the\nbetter things of life.\nLet the world understand that you are going to\neducate your children, and sooner or later the\nworld will help you.  Be sure, also, that you have a\ngood schoolhouse in your community.  I am glad\nto see that our people are drawing the line between\nthe good and the bad.  Draw it tighter and tighter.\nI am glad to note a decrease in lynching.  We\nmust let the people understand that we are to stay\non the farms and build up the South.  We must\nhave protection.  Let the world know that we do\nnot shield crime.  Let us be proud of our race and\nresolve to make of it the best and most useful race\nin the world.\n\nTHE WORKERS CONFERENCE AT TUSKEGEE \nBy a unique plan, Mr. Washington has\nsucceeded in bringing together the horny-handed\nsons of toil represented by the farmers \nand the educational and Christian\nworkers as seen in the teachers and moral\nreform workers.

Bruce\n\n     We are frequently reminded by some of the \nleading journals of Europe and America\nthat the Anglo-Saxon race is the stronger\nrace, and when we examine the sources of \nits strength and power, we find the \"Long\nTom,\" the Maxim, the Holland Torpedo\nboat, and the latest improved devices in\nsub-marine warfare very much in evidence,\nand standing armies equipped with every\nmodern death-dealing implement to give\nforce to the assertion that the Anglo-Saxon\nis the stronger race.\n     But this strength of which the Anglo-Saxon\nrace so proudly boasts is physical\nrather than moral in its character - artificial\nrather than natural.  It is the strength of \nthe brute and the bully, and its thin veneer\nof civilization and Christianity does not \nconceal its true character.\n     Ever since the dawn of civilization there\nhas been a struggle for the supremacy of\nthe earth among the nations.  The armed\nnations have ever been a menace to the \nunarmed nations who have been the victims\nof the relentless aggressions of the stronger,\nwhose covetous eyes and itching palms\nhave been laid upon the possessions of these\nweaker peoples, and who by force and fraud\nhave despoiled them of their heritage in the \nnames of civilization and Christianity.\n     The Creator of us all, we are told in Deuteronomy \nxxxiii;8 - \"Divided to the nations\ntheir inheritance, when he separated the\nsons of Adam, he set the bounds of the\npeople according to the number of the children\nof Israel,\"  and in Acts xvii:26 - \"And\nhath made of one blood all nations of men\nto dwell on all the face of the earth, and\nhath determined the times before appointed\nand the bounds of their habitation.\"\n     A liberal interpretation of these passages\nwould seem to convey the idea that the\nstronger nations are developing their\nstrength in the wrong direction when they\ninvade the domains of those nations whose\n\"bounds and habitations have been determined\nby the Almighty\" and the \"spheres\nof influence,\" which they have established\nare a wicked intrusion upon the rights and \nprivacy of peoples who are fulfilling their\nmission upon earth in accordance with the\nDivine plan, which has \"determined the\ntimes before appointed and the bounds of \ntheir habitation.\"\n     There are many kinds of strength, but\nbrute or physical strength is not to be\nregarded a desirable attribute of greatness\neither in a nation or an individual. . . .for\nit is said and truly \"He poureth contempt\nupon princes, and weakeneth the strength\nof the mighty.\"\n     The prize fighter and the bull dog are\nsplendid examples of brute strength, the\nformer may be and is in many cases woefully\nlacking in moral and intellectual strength.\nMorally he is too often a degenerate whose\nhighest aim in life is to break his opponents\nribs, or nose, if not kill him outright.  The\nbull dog being a fighter and brute by nature\ncan do no other.\n     These two examples will suffice to illustrate\nmy point, viz:  That brute strength\nis not a commendable quality in the so,\ncalled stronger races of mankind and that \nin exercise of it to perpetuate themselves,\nand to extend their power and influence in\nthe earth, they are but little better than\nthe prize fighter or the bull dog, neither of\nwhom possesses any of those finer instincts\nwhich make for true greatness, and stand\nfor real strength.  Moral strength married\nto intellectual strength is preferable to physical\nor brute strength and is more conducive\nto human happiness and brotherhood.\n\n\nTHE STRONGER NATIONS VS. THE WEAKER NATIONS  257\n     The evident design and purpose of the\nAlmighty in \"fixing the bounds and habitations\nof nations\" manifestly was that\nnations should develop and grow under\ntheir own \"vine and fig tree\" without\nmolestation, else why the command \"Thou\nshalt not covet thy neighbor's house, his ox,\nnor his ass, nor anything that is his.\"  The\nlanguage is mandatory, it says \"Thou shalt\nnot.\"  This being true, why are the nations\nof the earth -- the strong nations under the\npretext of civilizing and Christianizing\npeople, who are peacefully pursuing their\nown course -- establishing \"spheres of influence,\"\nannexing territory, and forcing their\ncivilization and religion upon them?  They\nhave not cultivated the arts of war -- they\nshrink from war.\n     Is it fair for a highwayman to characterize\nan unarmed traveler whom he meets in \nthe highway and forces to stand and deliver\nhis valuables--a weakling and a coward?\nIt manifestly is not.  Neither is it fair for\nthe \"stronger races\" who have made a \nbusiness of war and who have, and are\napplying their skill and genius to the manufacture\nof the implements of war by which\nto subordinate weaker races, to characterize\nthem as such.  The strength of any race or\nindividual improperly used is their greatest\nweakness.  \"Righteousness exalteth a \nnation, but sin is a reproach to any people,\"\nand who shall say the dispoiling of those\nnations whose \"bounds and habitations\nhave been fixed by the Almighty,\" by the\ngrasping greed and not a sin that smells rank to \nheaven -- who?\n     The claim of the \"stronger races\" of the\nright to obtrude their civilization, their\nreligion and their armies and navies upon\npeoples who are quietly and unobtrusively\nworking out their own destiny along\nthe lines of least resistance, is, I think,\nrather a presumptuous claim which discovers\nat the same time the overweening ego,\nand phariseeism of those nations who profess\nto have a monopoly of \"enlightenment\nand morality.\"  The question arises ever\nand anon -- How do they know that their\ncivilization and their ideas of religion are\nbetter adapted to the development of these\nso-called weaker and uncivilized races,\nthan the civilization and religion which has\nkept them together since \"their bounds and\nhabitation\" was fixed by the Almighty?\nHow do they know that the Almighty wants\nthem to revise the original plan as they are\npersistently doing and thereby destroying\nthe peace and happiness of these inoffensive\npeoples who have never yet set on foot any\nplot, scheme, or plan, to possesses themselves\nof the heritage of these \"stronger\nraces,\" who have been contented and happy\nunder their \"own vine and fig tree\" and\nwilling that others should have and enjoy\nwithout molestation from them \"The gifts\nof God which are strewn with lavish kindness\"\nover all the earth and which are sufficient\nfor the happiness of all His children.\n     The establishment of \"spheres of influence\nin these distant lands far over the seas\nmeans the partitioning of the territory by\nthe invaders, and this is out of harmony\nwith the Divine purpose, because it violates\nthe original grant, and nullifies the Divine\npurpose.

Before he left Atlanta,\nLawyer Hill had been directed to report to\nNed Cranston as soon as he reached Hopewell.\nStrogoff had previously asked Cranston\nto do all he could to apprehend the man\nwho had fired the shot.\nStrogoff and Stuyvesant debated long\nover the advisability of bringing Ned Cranston\ninto the case.  In the end Strogoff's\ncounsel prevailed, with the result just\nstated.  Strogoff thought that since Cranston\nwas already in his employ, and since no\nfault had ever been found with the legal\nservice which he had performed from time\nto time, the best thing to do under the circumstances\nwould be to ask Ned to help in\nthe case.  Besides, he argued that he might\nstand a better show of securing justice, if\nhe secured some member of the local bar to\nbe associated with the Atlanta lawyer.\nStuyvesant finally yielded, though not\nwithout a mild protest.\n\"I am sorry to believe it, old man,\"\nsaid Stuyvesant, \"but I have been told no \njury in Georgia would convict a white man\nfor shooting a Negro.\"\n\"But the man shot me,\" remarked\nNathan Strogoff.\n\"Oh, pshaw !\" said the other man, \"the \n\njury will say that was accidental and therefore\nexcusable.  Still I think it is well to\nspend a little money and test the matter.\"\nAt first nobody in the little town knew,\nor seemed to know, who had fired the shot.\nNed Cranston appeared to be as much interested\nas the other lawyer for the prosecution, \nand yet even Ned confessed his inability\nto find anything like a clue to\nthe perpetrator of the deed.  One of the\nPinkerton men ventured to ask him one\nday why the village authorities had seemed\nso indifferent about the matter.  Ned \nreplied : \n\"Because the shot was fired at a nigger,\nand a nigger has no rights that a white man\nis bound to respect.\"\n\"Do you know the person at whom the\nshot was fired?\" asked the detective.\n\"No, but I've seen him about town here\nmany a time.\"\n\"Since the shooting?\"\n\"No, before the shooting.  I don't think\nit would be healthy for him to show up \nhere now.  If he's anywhere around, he'd\nbetter lie low, if he knows what is best for\nhim.\"\nThe detective said nothing, but looked\nvery wise.\nBy-and-by, after they had been working\non the case for two weeks, the station agent \nwalked up to the lawyer from Atlanta and\nsaid :\n\"I hear you are trying to find the man\nwho shot Nathan Strogoff.  I thought I\nwould save you further trouble by telling\nyou that I did it myself.  I am at your \nservice.  Get your papers, and send the\nconstable around.\"\nWhen the agent gave himself up, as the\nphrase is, witnesses could be had in plenty, \n\n\nTHE WELDING OF THE LINK     259\n\nand all that was necessary to arrange before\nthe preliminary trial could be held was to\nsecure Strogoff's deposition.\nEvery judicious historian omits a number\nof details.  I shall do so in this\ninstance, and, accordingly, I shall give only\nthe verdict of the trial justice at the conclusion\nof the hearing.  Pushing his gold-rimmed\nspectacles above his eye-brows,\nthis parlous individual said :\n\"From the evidence it appears that a\nnigger had insulted a company of white\nladies and gentlemen, and Mr. Jones, in a \nvery right and proper manner, resented the\ninsult.  I am sorry that a worthy man,\nwho happened to be in the way, was struck\nby a stray bullet,but I commend the\naccused for his prompt and manly action.\nThe court does not regard the evidence as\nsufficient to hold the prisoner, and so the\ncase is dismissed.\"\n\nCHAPTER IX.\nTHE INTERVIEW WITH DR. COE.\n\n\"Doctor, sister is bent on marrying that\ninfernal Yankee,\" said Ned Cranston late\none night, as he and Dr. Coe sat along in\nthe doctor's office.\nAbout four months had passed away\nsince the death of Mrs. Cranston.  Ned\nhad dropped in to see the doctor, according\nto a frequent custom, before going home\nfor the night.\n\"She might do worse,\" was Dr. Coe's\nlaconic reply.\nNed drummed upon the window casing,\nand looked far out into the night.  Returning\nto the charge, he said :\n\"Come now, doctor ; speak to me--give\nme your candid opinion.  Is it best for\nLouisa to do such a thing?\"\n\"Your mother answered that question\nfor you long ago ;  but since you bring your\ntroubles to me I do not mind saying that I\nthink you had better allow your sister to\nselect her own husband.\" \n\n\"I should never speak to sister again, if\nshe were to marry that man.\"\n\"That isn't what you promised your\nmother.\"\n\"I promised mother nothing.  I heard\nall she said, but if you will remember, doctor,\nthat I never said one word--not one.\" \nThe conversation continued in this strain\nfor ten or fifteen minutes.  At times Dr.\nCoe tried to give Ned a gentle hint as to\nwhat he thought was the best thing for\nLouisa to do, and at other times he labored\nto show Ned how foolish his stubborn\nopposition really was.  He observed, as the\nconversation went ahead, that Ned did not\nspeak with the old-time fire and the old\ntime bluster, though he did try to make\nuse of the old-time epithets.  Dr. Coe took\nthis as a hopeful indication that there was\nsome disagreement between the young\nman's thoughts and the young man's\nwords.  As it proceeded, the interview\nbecame more and more spicy.\n\"Believe me, doctor,\" said Ned, \"it is\nno mere customary prejudice with me--no\nmere brute instinct--nor is it maudlin sentiment.\nIt is more.  It is a responsibility,\na faith, a religion.  If Louisa should marry\na Northern man, she would not only separate\nherself from me, but from her section\nbesides--in fact, from everything that is\nbest and finest in Southern life.\"\n\"But in marrying a Northerner,\" interrupted\nDr. Coe, \"she would be doing\nnothing original or extraordinary.  Don't\nyou know, Ned, that many of the leaders\nin Northern society are Southern girls who\nhave married Northern men?  And I think,\nat the point things have come to in this\ncountry, it would not be an abjuration, it\ncould not be called an apostasy, nor could\nit be characterized as any sort of moral\ntreachery for your sister to give herself in\nmarriage to a Northern man.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Ned, \"but the Southern\nwomen who have traduced their section by\nmarrying Yankees must have been notoriously", "120", 125, 125, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-025:00638", "NATIONAL LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS\n\nREGIONAL DIRECTORS\n\nFIRST REGION\nMISS KATHARINE LUDINGTON\n55 PRATT STREET, HARTFORD, CONN.\n\nSECOND REGION\nMRS.

These are big\nand worthwhile aims and if the woman's vote can\nbring this contribution from women to the body\npolitic, then the ratification of the Federal\nSuffrage Amendment will prove to have been the\ngreatest achievement of our time.\n\nThe work of the National League of Women Voters has been\nincreasing so in scope and growing so in momentum that our present\nfacilities are entirely inadequate. Money pledged at our first convention\nlast February will not carry us through half the things that\nwe are being called upon to do. Before our next convention in April,\n1921, we must double the amount pledged or refuse to help great legislative\nprojects to which the convention committed us.\n\nAs you have helped to bring about the great suffrage victory,\nwe take it for granted that you are still keenly interested.\nMay we also take it for granted that you will continue your financial\naid? Enclosed is a slip which we hope to receive back from you as a\nmeasure of your interest and desire to help.\n\nSincerely yours,\nMarie Stuart Edwards\n(Mrs. Richard Edwards) Treasurer.\nAmelia Bryce Pinchot\n(Mrs. Gifford Pinchot) Finance Chairman.\n\n5\nI made up my mind, then and there, that he should not have the\npleasure of forcibly detaining me, so I decided to remain in the station\ntill the police arrived. Every time the station door opened I expected\nto see an officer of the law coming to arrest me.\nAfter waiting about fifteen minutes\nI inquired how much longer I would have to remain there, before the\npolice came. \"Take your seat , the ticket agent roared, shaking his fist at me\n\" I am a busy woman\", I replied, \"and it is not right to keep me waiting\nhere so long for arrest.\" The agent then jumped from his chair, rushed to\nthe telephone again and jerked the handle so viciously I thought he would\nbreak it. He phoned for the police a second time. I waited patiently for \nwhat seemed to me a long time, expecting very minute to have an officer\nopen the station door and arrest me.\nFinally I went to the ticket window and said\"I will not wait any long\ner for arrest\" I shall leave this station. \"Go away from that window, take your seat. You are disorder\nly, You know you are.\" \" \"No I am not disorderly\" I replied. I had no idea\nit would offend you to ask you a civil question\"\nof giving offence\nI then left the waiting room, altho I feared [fearing] that the agent would run out\nand grab me and detain me in the station. I asked a white cab man whom I\nsaw standing at the door if he knew where a paper-hanger by the name of\nRokes [Stokes] lived. He said he did. I did not ask the cab man to take me to the\nman's home, for I felt sure he would not allow a colored woman to ride in\nhis cab. But my mind was greatly relieved, when he inquired in a kindly\nmanner \"Do you want to go to Rokes' home?\" \"Yes,\" I replied, \"Will you\ntake me?\" He said he would and he did.\nAfter I had waited an hour at his home Mr. Rokes finally came. He told me\nhe had heard about the trouble I had had at the station, and he seemed\ndeeply concerned. I did not urge him to tell me what he had heard, because\nI wanted to focus my thoughts on the speech I was to deliver in a few\nhours. \nAfter the meeting that evening Mr. Rokes told me that the ticket\nagent had sworn out a warrant for disorderly conduct against me and that", "48", 123, 123, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-002:00705", "have missed seeing it for anything. \nIt is just like Carrie Bruce \nto be so thoughtful of you.

Turner\n\nWhat is matter?  What are atoms?  Is\nmatter eternal?  Had these questions been\nasked only a few years ago, the well informed\nhigh-school boy would have replied:\n\"Matter is anything that occupies space.\nMaterial bodies are composed of complex\nunits known as molecules ; these molecules \nin turn, are yet composed of smaller bodies \nknown as atoms.  An atom is indivisible,\nimpenetrable, indestructible, eternal.\nThere are two distinct phenomena in the\nuniverse, matter and energy.  Each is \n\neternal.  This truth is epitomized by able\nscientists in two laws known respectively as\n'the conservation of matter' and 'the conservation \nof energy.' \"  The conservative\nscientist would have answered :  \"The\ntheory held by most scientists is that atoms\nare the ultimate units into which matter\ncan be divided and that they are indestructible\nand eternal.  But, to be frank, this is\nall theory.  Really, the answer to the question\n'Is matter eternal?' is unknown and, for\nthe present at least, unknowable.\"  Ask \n\n\nATOMS ARE COMPLEX BODIES     265\n\nthese questions today and the high school\nboy may return the same answer, but the\nwell-informed scientists will reply: \"Science\nis progressive.  A fact once discovered is\nalways the same ;  but the discovery of a \nfew new facts often makes necessary the\nrecasting of theories based upon known\nfacts.  Recent discoveries have revolutionized\nour ideas of matter.  We now know\nthat atoms are divisible into smaller bodies\nknown as corpuscles or electrons and have\nmuch evidence indicative of the decay of\nmatter.  Indeed, we seem to be on the verge\nof discovering the real nature of matter.\"\nThe purpose of this paper is to epitomize\nsome of the researches that have made possible\nthis statement.\nScientific minds are conservative and are\nslow to exchange old lamps for new for fear\nthat the old lamp may prove an Aladdin's\nlamp.  A theory once enthroned rules until \nan array of indisputable facts causes its abdication. \nThe conception of atoms stated\nalone has dominated chemical thought for\na long time.  If an ancient ancestry is a\nmark of quality, then this conception\nis of the bluest blood ; for it can boast of a \nline of ancestors extending at least as far\nback as the early Greek philosophers.  Leucippus,\nDemocritus, Epicurus, Lucretius,\nGassenda, Boyle, Newton, Lavoisier and\nHiggins promulgated ideas that were worthy\nancestors of Dalton's atomic theory, which\nwas given to the world in 1803.  Turner,\nPenny, Erdmann, but above all Berzelins,\ndid must to force the acceptance of this \ntheory.  Avogadro, Cannizzaro, Franklin,\nKekule and other contributed to make it a\nfixity.  Yet for more than a century another\nclass of men have been accummulating facts\nthat militate against the idea that an atom\nis indivisible and indestructible.  Five different\nsaps, the first of which was started\nmore than a century ago, have accomplished\nthis.  These saps were the normal results\nof the following discoveries :  the discovery\nof the facts revealed by electric decomposition ; \nthe discovery of the cathode rays ; \nthe discovery of X-rays or Roentgen rays ; \nthe discovery that uranium and radium are\nradio-active ; the discovery that radio-activity\nis a general property of matter.\nElectrolytic dissociation commonly known\nas electrolysis, is more or less understood\nby all who lay any claims to culture.  It is\nwell-known that an electric current, in passing\nthrough any salt, decomposes that salt,\ncausing some of the atoms to accumulate\nat one electrode and the remainder at the\nother.  To the matter-of-fact seeker after\ndollars, this discovery meant the initiation\nof the electro-plating industry ; but to the\nearnest truth-seeker who is trying to solve\nthe riddle of the universe, it revealed an\nintimate relation between electricity and\nthe atom.\nAlthough cathode rays have been much\nstudied since their discovery by the German\nscientist Hiltorf about a half century ago,\nyet I doubt much if the average educated\nman has a clear-cut idea as to what these\nrays are and of their bearing on the atomic\ntheory.  If you arrange, a short distance\napart in an air-tight glass tube, the terminii\nof two electric wires and then pass a current\nof electricity through the circuit ; one of\nthose terminii will be known as the cathode\nand the other as the anode.  That terminus\nby which the current leaves the tube is\nknown as the cathode.  Now if the air in\nthis tube is exhausted until it exerts a pressure\nof only one-thousandth of an atmosphere\nand a current of electricity allowed \nto flow through the apparatus, a peculiar\nphenomenon appears.  On the glass, opposite\nthe cathode, a green phosphorescent\nblotch flashes into existence and continues\nto glow.  Between the glass and the cathode\nthe eye detects nothing, for all is darkness.\nAdjust a small body between the cathode\nand the phosphorescence and at once a\nshadow of the body appears in the midst of\nthe blotch.  Evidently something invisible\nis passing from the cathode to the glass.\n\n", "123", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00127", "260     THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO\n\nnotoriously poor specimens of Southern chivalry\n--frivolous and rattle-brained.

I have something here I want you to\nread.\"  Saying which, Dr. Coe ran his\nhand into a pigeon hole of his desk, and\ntook therefrom a newspaper clipping.\nHanding it to Ned Cranston he asked him\nto read it.\nThe clipping was headed, \"The Conquests\nof Southern Girls,\" and gave a \nrecord of brilliant marriages made by\nSouthern girls in the North.  Ned was surprised\nto see it stated that the woman who\nhad the satisfaction of being allied with\nmore old New York families than any other\nmother-in-law that had ever gone to that\ngreat place from any other city was a \nGeorgian, and that she belonged to one of\nthe first families in the Empire State of the\nSouth.  Through the marriage of her\ncharming and tactful daughters and her\nonly son, she was allied with the Astors,\nthe Goelets and the Vanderbilts.  Her\nchildren had married into the wealthiest\nNew York society.  He also learned from \nthe same clipping that the wife of America's\nmost famous newspaper and magazine\nartist was a member of a grand old Virginia \nfamily, and that two of her sister were\nmarried, one to a Boston millionaire and\nthe other to a New York millionaire.  An\naccount was also given of how a certain\nLouisiana family and an ancient Alabama\nfamily were allied through marriage to the\nVanderbilts, the Belmonts and the Shepards.\nThrough these alliances, one of the\nsons of the family had been placed in Wall\nStreet and died a millionaire.  Ned continued\nto read the column of closely printed \n\nfacts, giving scores of names and dates,\nand many other details.\n\"Read the closing statement,\" said Dr.\nCoe impatiently.  Ned read as follows :\n\"And one of the millionaire owners and editors \nof one of New York's most scholarly daily papers,\na man who is one of the grandsons of William\nLloyd Garrison, was recently married to a Southern\nwoman of rare beauty, who is the grand-daughter\nof the late Robert E. Lee.\"\n\"So you see,\" commented Dr. Coe, \"if\nLouisa were doing wrong in marrying a\nNorthern man, she would be doing wrong\nwith--well, to say the least, very excellent\ncompany ;  and not a very small company \nat that.\" \n\"You can't believe all you see in the\nnewspapers,\" muttered Ned.\n\"No one is so blind,\" answered Dr. Coe,\n\"as he who will not see.  Ned, I believe\nyou must be crazy, and it is high time you \nwere quitting your nonsense.  It is getting\nto be so now, my boy, that the man who\nharks back to some fair illusion of the past\nis a back number.

Isn't that so?\" \n\"Only partially so,\" replied Ned Cranston.\n\"So far as the South was concerned\nthe question of slavery was subordinated to\nthe more fundamental question of State\nRights.\"\n\"There is no need of quibbling,\" said \nDr. Coe.  \"Ostensibly the South fought\nabout State Rights, and ostensibly the\nNorth fought about the preservation of the\nUnion, but really and truly the question\nof slavery was at the foundation of the\nwar ; it was the black man from Africa\nabout which we fought.  Now listen awhile,\nI want to read you something.\"\nDr. Coe took a newspaper from his desk,\nand, turning to a piece entitled \"Uncle\nTom's New Cabin,\" he said :\n\"Now listen to this, and tell me what\nyou think of this man's philosophy ; and\nhe is one of our own Southern men, too.\nThese are his words : \n\" ' For a half hundred years we have fought and\nwrangled and bled and died about this Black Man\nfrom Africa!  Is the wrangle worth its fearful\ncost?  Shall the Northern section of our common\ncountry always turn its hand against the great\nSouthern section of our country?  Shall the young\nAmerican of the North steel his heart against the\nyoung American of the South over an alien's\ncause?  Shall the children of one blood and of a\ncommon glorious heritage divide in bitterness over \na strange in our midst?  Shall the memories of\nEutaw and Yorktown be obliterated in the recollections\nof Hamburg and Wilmington?  Shall the\npeace and harmony of this great Republic be forever\nimperiled for the sake of the Negro, whose \nfaults and whose weakness so wonderfully outweigh\nhis virtues and his gratitude?  Shall the\nBlack Man from Africa hinder and delay the work\nand the destiny of our imperial race?\n\" ' Great God!  The idea is monstrous and unthinkable.\nThe South is neither cruel nor unpatriotic,\nand the North knows it.  The North is \n\nneither immovable nor vindictive, and the South\nknows it.  If either of us is mistaken, and both of\nus are misunderstood, we are yet one people, and\nwe must meet upon the plane of one brotherhood\nand one destiny.'\n\n\"Now, there it is in a nutshell,\" said\nDr. Coe, as he threw aside the paper and\nlooked at Ned.  \"The black man from \nAfrica has been the one chief cause of suspicion\nand estrangement and separation\nbetween the North and South since\n1861 and long before ; and he is the chief\ncause of separation today.  I protest, Ned,\nthat if it were not for what you believe to\nbe the North's traditional love of the\nNegro,  you would not have--you could not\nhave the slightest possible objection to\nCharles Stuyvesant as a brother-in-law.\nWe are of one country, and we are of one\nblood.  It is foolish for us to remain forever\ndivided, no matter what the cause.\nNow, isn't it true that you hate more what\nyou believe Charles Stuyvesant stands for\nthan  you do Charles Stuyvesant himself?\" \n\"Perhaps so,\" said Ned indifferently. \n\"Well, go home tonight,\" said Dr. Coe,\n\"and tell Louisa about your change of\nheart--confess your sins ; give up your provincialism,\nyour narrowness and hatred,\nand tell her that you consent to her marriage.\nBury the past ;  let by gones be\nby-gones.\"\n\"I'd see myself in hell first,\" said Ned\nCranston angrily.  Without so much as\nglancing at Dr. Coe, Ned walked hastily to \nthe door and left the room.\nIt was past midnight when Ned stepped\nout into the street.

The men appeared were especially horror\nstricken at the thought of my being placed under arrest. When I told them\nI would not have cared very much if I had been taken to jail on the charge\nof disorderly conduct under the circumstances, they shook their heads in\nfierce disapproval of my attitude and assured me that such a disgraceful\nexperience would have ruined me for life. Some of my personal friends were\nso horrified, when I related the story to them, that I wondered [could not help wondering]\nwhether they would have associated with me afterward, if I had actually\nbeen sent to jail.I could not help contrasting the difference between\nthe attitude assumed by [way] English women concerning the [regarded the] ordeal of being arrested and that manifested\nby some of my own friends. In the ball room of the New Willard Hotel I once heard the daughter of a distinguished\nEnglish prelate- the Bishop of Canterbury- relate the experiences\nthru which British women passed in their effort to secure the suffrage.\nShe was petite, and dainty and wore a light gray gown which was both modish and becoming [made her look like]\nShe looked so ethereal as she stood on the rostrum, she gave one the impression \n[a fairy or syphl that one would suppose that she would be frightened]\nthat she would be terribly frightened if an ordinary mortal should\n[if she heard an ordinary mortal say \"boo\" in her direction.]\nsay \"boo\" to her. But she began her speech by saying \"How many women in\nthis room have ever been arrested for the sake of suffrage? Will those of you who have been, please raise your hands? She beamed encouragingly\nupon her audience and looked [around as though she expected to] as tho she confidently expected to\nsee several hands go up at least. But, nary a had was raised. The little\nEnglish woman seemed very much [disappointed and] surprised, not to say disgusted,and after waiting\nin vain for a few minutes she remarked with keep disappointment [disappointed] apparent in\nher voice. \"Why, if I were to ask English women such a question in an audience [composed\nof English women the size of this] as large as this at least hafda dozen hands would be raised.\"\nBut since citizens the women of the United States do not look with such indulgence\nupon whose who have been arrested, even for the cause of suffrage perhaps it is just as well that\nI have never been sent to jail.

Stripped of this feature, it\nbecomes deportation or exile. And the rights of\ncitizenship must be respected. Moreover, just as\nthere are now tens of thousands of Indians, who as\nto racial composition, are no more Indian than Caucasian, \nso there are hundreds of thousands-millions\nprobably-of native Negroes who are half and\nmore, or even approximately, Caucasian. Suppose\nthis impracticable thing could be done, these very\npersons who plan to \"get rid of the Negro\" would\nsoon appear on the new ground with other forms \nof imposition. Indeed it is now impossible for the\nblack men to find a suitable land exempt from invasion\nby the white and yellow varieties. It is a\nmost suggestive fact that never in the world's history\nhas there been such extensive inter-distribution\nof the various types and sub-types as there is \nnow. And the movement increases.\nPlainly, after many years and much evasion and\nincalculable harm, the situation fairly drives us to a\nmore intelligent, more comprehensive consideration\nof man! We begin to realize that certain laws are\nfor the time troublous, and mysteriously so. But\nit is now clear that it is incumbent upon us to \ndecide whether inter-distribution of types or geographical\ninterchange tends ultimately to benefit\nor to harm. We cannot decide infallibly without\nlaying aside every form of selfishness. Meantime,\nalmost any spectator can perceive this is distinctively\nthe time of the cosmopolite, that the time is already\nhere when the good qualities of this or that people\nare valued the world over. Surely such universal\ntruths must be indicative and infinitely so; they\nmust mean that the movement of unifying human\ninterests is at last unmistakable and well under\nway. Presently there will be a real Peace Congress\nwith no dagger up the sleeve, but an equitable\nheart behind every shirt front. The able gentleman\nmust conclude that but little is needed in addition\nto strict honor, a small international police force\u2014\na few amiable requirements, and an inexpensive\nbut captivating fleet. These worthy gentlemen representing\nthe controlling nations, will insure that,\ninstead of being lost in war, money and lives shall\nbe nobly and beautifully spent at home. \nAlthough the infinite laws concerning man's\npsychic nature and destiny cannot be set aside or\nchanged, even by majority vote, they can and must\nbe discovered, systematized and made popular and\nhumanely useful. This, of course, takes time. \nWell, have we not had all the time that thus far\nhas appeared. Consider the countless ages of barbarism\nof which the most inclusive history gives\nbut a suggestion, for we look backward into prehistoric\nmist. Consider the known ages of semi-barbarism\nfrom which we have not yet emerged, for\nthose who understand something of political and war\nhistory for the past fifty years, and the shameful\ngrowth of the so-called \"trusts,\" especially those\nwhich have to do with the necessities of life, which\nare less crude forms of human slavery, appreciate\nthe statement that we have not yet emerged from\nsemi-barbarism. Consider all this and much more, \nand it must be admitted that we have already\nhad a long time.\nOf course, the movement is slow. It is said that\nEmerson was the product of seven or eight generations\nknown to have been cultured, aspiring people.\nBut how the tireless endeavor finally paid! Note\nthat his serenity and gentleness were coupled with\nthat irresistible power which ultimately must make\nthe whole world blossom as the rose.

It fosters hatred of fellow citizens;\nit paralyzes the sense of equity; it stultifies the\nbrighter qualities of self and develops the bad in\nothers. All racial characteristics not conformable\nto the general world are destined to be modified and\nmodified until they disappear. It is evidently\ntrue that such superficial markings as color, peculiar\nlanguage, etc., have a value\u2014a subordinate\nvalue\u2014in the economy of nature. But the use is\ntemporary, since they change after the accomplishment\nof peculiar purposes, and even disappear according\nto environment and dominance of the\npsychic.\nMother nature, comprehensive, and severely insistent \ndame, will have her children become symmetrical\nwomen and men; she is busy with the \nproduction of man, and forever insists that he be\nmultiplied and distributed that universal justice\nmay be realized. \n\nIn the Sanctum\n\nNegro Workmen Superior to Italian\nWorkmen\nOf recent, many Southern newspapers\nhave been agitating the question of importing\nforeign laborers into the South to supplant\nthe Negro laborers. Glowing pictures\nhave been painted showing the super-abundant \nfarm products of the South under the \nsuperior labor of the Italian, Chinese\nCoolie and other raw heathen over the\ndocile and easy going Negro. An experiment\nwas tried recently in Griffin, Ga.,\nthat furnishes food for thought. The\naccount is as follows:\nSome time ago they imported from New York\nabout seventy-five laborers from Italy. For a \nwhile all went well, but today the Italians struck,\nand are now planning to go back to New York at\nonce.\nThe reasons given for the strike are many, and\nyet the grievances of the men are hard to learn, as\nfew, if any, of those remaining here speak English.\nIt seems that the management is not very much\nworried about the foreigners leaving, as their work\nhas not been as good as was expected.\nPlaced side by side with Negro laborers, they\ndid not show up according to the claims of the\ncontractors from New York who furnished them.\nThey were worth nothing to the merchants, as\nthey spent practically no money here, being\nextremely frugal and buying most of their supplies\nfrom New York and Italy. The Negro\nlaborer is much in demand here. Their condition\nwas never better in this section.\nThe South is well off with this immobile\nbut reliable labor machinery in the faithful\narm of the blacks, but she does not know\nit. She has never fully appreciated her\nopportunity in the black laborer. True\nthere are drawbacks in many of them, but\nthese can be overcome by fair treatment.\nWe would urge the Negro laborer to\nbecome more frugal and save more of his\nearnings, but this would be considered a\ncrime by many of the storekeepers on the\nfarms. \nThe Negro laborer has certain peculiarities \nsuperior to any other laborer in the\nworld. He is light-hearted and cheerful in\nspirit. This was evidenced even in the \nmost brutal slavery ever inflicted upon a\npeople. He toiled all day under his master's\nmerciless lash, and danced and shouted\nall night with a fairy heart or an angel\nspirit. Then he marched out from that\nprison singing the hallelujahs of the plantation\nmelodies without a drop of malice in \nhis heart. In the next place, the Negro\nlaborer is patient. Though he came from\nthe sun-scorched shores of Africa and with\nblood as hot as the ancient Sahara, he\nknows how to keep cool, hold steady and\ngo on with his work. Another mark of\nthis laborer is his adjustability to circumstances\nand places. He is at home in the\nicy North with the cold Saxon, and is easy\nin the sunny South with the fire-eating\nSoutherner. Then the Negro laborer never\nstrikes. We are not clear in our mind that\nthis is a virtue. But we are sure that\nthe practice is wise and makes for the\npeace of the community. He can be happy \nwith half treatment.\nLet the South treat this man with justice\nand her hillsides will blossom and her fields\nwill wave with ripened grain.\nDiscussion Not Crimination\nIt becomes necessary again to emphasize\nthe purpose of THE VOICE OF  THE NEGRO,\nand to call attention to the spirit of the editorial\nmanagement.  We are seekers after\ntruth, and in that quest it is our purpose to\nkeep our spirit calm and self-possessed.\nWe respect truth and nothing else.  There\nare no strings tied to us.  We intend to be\nas fearless as truth and our only invective\nis clean cultured, vigorous, well-approved\nlanguage of thoughtful gentlemen.

One day a young colored woman came in and purchased a dozen bottles.  We asked her \n\"What are you going to do with so much?\"  She replied, \"It makes my hair long, soft and easy to comb, and I am \ngetting it for my friends.\"  We then said, \"Tell us all about it and we will give you a dozen extra bottles.\"  She\nthen told of the merits of our pomade when applied to the hair of colored people.  It was a great discovery.  To us \nit was like finding a nugget of gold.  This young lady, her friends, and we, through our advertisements, began to\ntell of the merits of this pomade.  The people tried it and testified to its true value and the sale is now unprecedented.\nFull directions with every bottle.  Only 50 cents.

He butted See Kee in his stomach once an' the umpire told him not to do it no more. But he was so mad after See Kee showed he could whip him that he butted him a second time.\" \n\"I bet ef See Kee had gone caperin' 'roun' that ring like a goat, they would show have kicked him out.\"\n\"They wouldn't had done nothin' different\", Aunt Dinah, agreed Dilsey.\n\"But Mr. Carroll said he wished Mr. Carpenter had kept on buttin' See Kee 'round that ring, so that he could have been - \" Dilsey paused a moment as though searching for a word - \"could have been disqualified. An Mr. Tillman said he would rather have had the white man disqualified than beaten by a black man. I reckon Mr. Carpenter felt that way, too. You raly cant blame him. An Aunt Dinah you jes ought to uv heard how they made fun of See Kee. Mr. Tillman said he looked like an ape acted, like an ape an fit to die like an ape, Mebbe he does look like an ape - I aint never seen him, not even so much as his picsher - but he did one thing that no ape wouldn't have done an' very few white men I know. Oncet Mr. Carpenter fell so hard, he couldn't get up. He was es helpless as a newborn twin. An' what do you think See Kee did? He didn't do a thing but stoop down and raise him up same ez if he was liftin a baby. But jes es he placed Mr. Carpenter on his feet, that engrateful man hauled off and pasted See Kee one fierce blow on his jaw, Yassum. He \n\n\n8\ndidn't do nothin diffrunt.

Then all the papers in the world would a been sayin' 'Look a yonder now. Aint that jes like a nigger now?\"\n\"Deed they wouldn't uv done nothin diffrunt,\" assented Dilsey. An' what you reckon, Aunt Dinah, they're trying to get See Kee to come over her an' fight a cullud man in this country an mebbe the big, thick-set Irishman that whipped Mr. Carpenter. Some folks dont like him. They call him a shirker, 'cause he wouldn't fight. But See Kee fit in the war, I mean he fit show 'nough, an they just covered him with medals of one kind an' another, 'cause he was so brave.\"\n\"Well, Dilsey, dont tell me no more 'bout prize fights. I dont believe in no fightin of no kind no how. But See Kee didnt invent the prize fight an neither did the Aferkins. I wouldn't go to see a prize fight fer a hundred dollars. But ef they jes mus' have em, 'an a black man jes get to prize-fight with a white man, I wants the black man to win. You heah me? I wants the black man to come out way on top. I hates all these here wars white people are always fightin' in. They kills theyselves and foces yeller, brown and black people to fight wid em. And these poah cullud folks don' know what day's fightin 'bout half the time. But, ef white folks jes will start wars spite of da debble hisself an' ef they jes mus' prize fight, hits a mighty good thing to let em see that black men kin fight jes as good as dey kin and sometimes enough sight better.

Alex. Bealer, of Thompson, Ga., \nrepresented, was apparently the religion of\nthe majority of our white neighbors.  It is\nplainly evident that Mr. Bealer's religion is\nnot Christianity, whatever else it is.

We have\nright in our midst strong men, men of conviction\nand courage too, and above all\nChristian men.  Of the far-seeing, God-fearing\nmen of Atlanta and the South, we\nplace Dr. H. S. Bradley, pastor of the\nTrinity M. E. Church, in the very first\nrank.  Dr. Bradley has time and again\nshown that he believes in Christianity as\ntaught by Christ.  His splendid judgment,\nhis altruistic spirit, and above all his earnest\nefforts to know and do the right in the\nlight of the teachings of the Bible have all\ncombined to enable this Southern minister\nof aristocratic birth to take a broader view \n\nRev. H. S. BRADLEY, D.D.\n\nof our Southern problems than most of the\nministers of the South.  Most of the white\nmen in the South who are at all liberal\ntowards the Negro, base their liberality on\nthe memories of their \"black mammy.\"\nThe term \"black mammy\" is repulsive to\nthe intelligent, self-respecting colored people, \nand the white man who begins his\npaper or address by using this term, at once\nloses the confidence of his colored hearers.\nSo far as we know, Dr. Bradley never refers\nto his \"black mammy.\"  He speaks of the\npatience and lovable qualities of the Negro\nwomen of slavery times, but he finds more\npleasing language to use than the offensive\nterm above mentioned.  Dr. Bradley shepherds\none of the largest and richest congregations\nin Atlanta.  At the close of his sermon\nSunday morning, July 2, Dr. Bradley\ngave utterance to a great truth which must\nunderlie and give vitality to any missionary \nmovement that is to be a real instead of a \n\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW     525\n\nsham attempt to christianize the world.\nThe preacher is reported to have said : \n\"The Negro in the South has never had a fair\nchance, socially, politically or commercially.\nSometimes I am lacking in courage to live up to\nmy highest thought, but I want to indorse what I\nheard a distinguished, learned and broad-minded \nminister once say at a conference of clergymen.\n\"That man said :  'If I could I would like to see \nevery Negro in the land raised to any own level.'\nHe was interrupted by one of his auditors, who \nasked if he would really want to be on an equality\nwith Negroes.  Another man present said : 'Don't\nstop to answer such an interruption as that ; go on\nwith your great speech.'  And it was a great\nspeech, and I want to here and now indorse it.\n\"This social caste that has grown up among us\nhas led many of us to believe that somehow because\nwe happened, without any choice or any merit of\nour own, to be born with a white skin the Lord\nloves us better and thinks a little more of us than\nhe does anybody with a darker skin.\n\"But I want to say to you that the man who does\nnot admit and live up to the fraternity of the Negro\n--yes, the fraternity, that is the word--whatever\nelse he may be is not a Christian.\n\"I am not afraid of race equality, and I'll tell\nyou my opinion of the man who is.  It is this, that\nhis social status must be very, very insecure that\nhe should be so infinitely solicitous about safeguarding\nit.\n\"Another of our dangers is too much democracy.\nIt tends in some instances to make us think that\nthere is no higher law than our own will, and no\nhigher officers than our own selves.  We had a\nstriking illustration of that in Georgia last week,\nand we have had many in recent years.\n\"There were more lynchings in the State of\nGeorgia last year than there were in the entire\nBritish Isles--yes, than there were in the British\nIsles for the last five years.  Statistics prove that.\n\"The men who committed that outrage at Watkinsville\nwere white-livered cowards.  They stole\nin, masked at night, to do that which no one of\nthem would have dared to do, unmasked and in\nthe fair light of day.  They were not content to\nwait until universal man spoke in the word called\nlaw.  The sneaked in like the cowards that they\nwere and smirched the fair name of the State.\n\"I have the heartiest contempt, too, for the\njailer who gave up his key, because somebody\npointed a pistol at his face.  Suppose that same\nmob had demanded that he send his daughter out\nto them.  If that had been the case the scoundrel,\ncoward though he is, would have died first.\n\"I tell you these outrages will not stop until we \n\nget men in office who are not afraid to die in the\nperformance of duty enjoined by their solemn\noath.\"\nDr. Bradley shows that he has a thorough\ngrasp of the situation.  Here in the South,\nwe are lost in a wilderness of fratricidal \nhatred, and it is plain to all thinking men\nthat there is a white side as well as a black\nside to our race problem.  Both races need\nto enlarge the horizon of their spiritual and\nintellectual discernment.  The white man\nmust understand that oppression breeds\nanarchy among the oppressed, and arrogance,\nharshness and brutality among the\noppressors.  The white and the black man\ncannot escape each other.  An All-Wise\nProvidence has made us co-inhabitants of\nthe same land, and, as fellow-worldlings,\nwe ought to love and help each other.  A\ncursory glance at history ought to be sufficient\nto convince us that we cannot maintain \nthe status quo.  In the long run the two\ngreat races must go up or down together.\nIf the Negro is backward, he ought all the\nmore to be helped.  As the man who has\nsmall-pox imperils the lives of all of his\nneighbors, even so viciousness and lust are\na constant menace to a sane and healthy\nsocial order.  The preservation of the\nSouthern white man's own civilization\ninvolves the salvation of the Negro.  This\nis the selfish reason why race fraternity\nshould exist.  But there is a higher reason.\nThe cardinal principles of Christianity are\nbased upon the Fatherhood of God and the\nbrotherhood of man.  The white man fears\n\"social equality.\"  Dr. Bradley dismisses\nthe bogey with becoming dignity.  If the\nwhite man's social standing is so weak that\nit will totter because he dares to be a\nChristian, then that social order ought to\ngo.  The question that should confront us\nall is which is more important, the triumph \nof Christianity or the preservation of our\nsocial order?  We answer by our conduct.\nDr. Bradley's sermon created a profound\nimpression in Atlanta, and must ultimately\ndo good.", "140", 122, 122, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00147", "526     THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO\n\nAn Example of\nFar-Sightedness \nProbably the most practical\nFourth of July\nspeech that we have\nhad the privilege of reading in a very long\ntime was the thoughtful and able address\ndelivered by Judge E.

In\nthe speech the ordinary Fourth of July\ntwaddle and platitudes about our land being\nthe asylum for the oppressed was left out ; \nthere was no apostrophizing of the flag, no\nglorification of the Declaration of Independence.\nJudge Callaway probably silently\nrecognized the fact that this document had\nlong since been removed from our halo of \nideals.

In \nthese latter days it has come into ill-repute. \nOf course, the Declaration was one of the\nloftiest, one of the must sublime utterances\nin all the range of human history.  But\nalthough Judge Callaway did not specifically\nmention the glorious history of the past, he\ndid say many things that were eminently\npractical and discerning about present day\nproblems for the farmers of the South.\nHe said that at least four-fifths of our Georgia\npopulation were engaged in or dependent\nupon agricultural pursuits, that farming\nlands are by far the greatest wealth\nproducing property of the State, and that\nif Georgia is to keep abreast in prosperity\nwith her sister States, she must give more\nattention to scientific and agricultural education\nand the land owners must have more\nregard for the welfare of the tenant.  Judge\nCallaway has touched here upon the most\nvital reason why in many places in Georgia\nwe have the landless man and the manless\nland.  The farming classes have not been\neducated into the arts of farming.  They have\nhave been allowed to do the best they could \n\nwith the limited farming knowledge handed\ndown by the former generations.  Consequently\nthey are not able to get out of the soil\nenough to meet the requirements of decent\nliving and to lay aside a little of their earnings\nfor the purpose of buying land.  The\nmajority of them live, so to speak, from hand\nto mouth.  It is not so much for the lack\nof economy as for the lack of ability to get\nout of the soil what there is in it.  Then \nwe have sparsely settled regions where labor\nis scarce because of the uninviting surroundings\nof country life in Georgia.  The\ncolored people form the larger per cent. of\ntenants in our State, and certainly there is for\nthem \"the lack of school facilities and the\nincreasing dangers in country life\" of which \nJudge Callaway spoke.  The learned Judge,\nspeaking of Negro labor says : \n\"If the present system of landlord and tenant\ncontinues, they must either be taught and instructed\nhow to farm intelligently, or they must be displaced\nby white tenants supplied by immigration.  Speaking\nfor myself, with the present lights before me,\nand from the experience of other sections of our\ncountry, I prefer to first experiment with an effort to\nimprove the Negro as a farm laborer, cropper and\ntenant, rather than experiment with that class of\nforeign labor which comes from the poorer and\nlower classes of European monarchies, were centuries\nof tyranny and oppression have thoroughly\nimbued them with a hatred of all form of government,\nand where anarchy and nihilism form a part\nof their religion.  This government of the people\nby the people, and sometimes, unfortunately, by\nthe mob may prove rather a dangerous soil in\nwhich to plant the unknown vagaries and fanaticisms\nof the laboring classes from the old world.\n\"I believe that our present labor can be greatly\nimproved.  At least it is well worth our while to\nmake a tremendous effort in that direction.  If the\nNegro is not a successful farmer, it is not altogether\nhis fault.  He has been working our lands and\nplowing our mules and hoeing our cotton all of his\nlife, and we owe it to him, as well as to our own\ninterests, to teach him the best methods of farming.\nIf he is not a skilled laborer it is largely because\nthose of us who, by reason of our superior\nintelligence, opportunities, ownership of property\nand authority, should have been his teachers, have,\nin a large measure, neglected our duty.\nJudge Callaway's whole speech is so fair \n\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW     527\n\nand thoroughly reasonable that it must\nhave fell like a thunderbolt out of a clear\nsky upon the ears of those Thompson\nfarmers.  Our readers will pardon us for\nallowing this upright judge to speak for\nhimself at length.  Among other things he\nsaid : \n\"It is by no means true that all the Negroes are\nfailures as farmers.  Many of them own their own\nfarms and stock, make good crops, improve their\nplaces, display great thrift and industry, pay their\ndebts promptly and make good citizens.  Many\nof them make good tenants--the best we can get.\nThere are many good Negro farm hands working\nthe farm lands all over the South who are industrious\nfaithful and easy to control.\n\"we are too apt to allow our impatience with\none trifling Negro to cause us to make condemnatory \nspeeches and remarks of the whole race, when,\ndeep down in our Southern hearts, we feel no such\nanimosity.  But it requires no courage to abuse the\nNegro, and we often do ourselves a great injustice\nby remaining silent and failing to challenge the\nflippant and wholesale abuse and denunciation\nwhich we sometimes hear from the lips of demagogues\nhurled at the whole Negro race.  It is not\nbecause we endorse the unworthy sentiments, nor\nfor lack of courage that we Southern people hold\nour tongues at such times, but rather that we rely\nupon the conservatism of our people not to be influenced\nby such people.\n\"I sometimes wonder what the better element of\nthe Negroes must think of us and our sense of\njustice and right when we allow these speeches to\ngo unchallenged, but with rare and only individual\nexceptions the occurrences provoke no visible resentment\nand our relations remain as before.  I \nsuppose they understand us, just as we understand\nthem, for deep down in our hearts there is a kindly\nfeeling between the Southern white man and the\nSouthern Negro.\n\"It requires no higher order of political courage\nor statesmanship to convert the much discussed \nNegro problem into a political issue, and call upon\nthe white people of the State to disfranchise him,\nspecially as the issue will be settled in an election\nwhere the Negro has no voice.  It is not a proposition \nto disfranchise ignorance or crime, or the purchasable\nvote, but only the Negro.  It will be well for\nGeorgians to carefully inquire into the purpose and\nwisdom of this agitation.  The Negro problem of\nwhich we hear so much from time to time, is not a\npolitical problem in Georgia.  As a general thing,\nthe Negro takes no part in politics and has never \n\ndone so except when drawn into politics by the\nwhite man.  He does not vote in Democratic primaries\nbecause very few of them are Democrats,\nand the Democratic party is the only organized party\nin the State.  Discriminating legislation aimed at an\nentire race of people does not appeal to one's sense\nof justice or fairness, and carries with it the direct\nadmission that we, the white people of Georgia,\nthrough whose veins courses the pure Caucasian\nblood ; we, who have all the reins of government\nin our hands, elect all the officers, make all the\nlaws and have the exclusive privilege of interpreting\nand enforcing them, cannot successfully govern\nthe weaker and inferior race of Negroes and\npreserve white supremaey in Georgia under equal\nlaws, and without discriminating race legislation.\nAre we prepared to make the admission?  And\nwill the promised benefits compensate us as a people\nfor the sacrifice of principle, the dangerous encroachment\nupon arbitrary class legislation, and\nthe ignominious confession of weakness?  When\nhas white supremacy in Georgia been in danger\nsince the days of reconstruction?  Even then it\nstood the test of that diabolical upheaval and came\nforth triumphant.  Who in this State is sincerely\napprehensive and genuinely afraid that white \npolitical supremacy will be overthrown in Georgia?\nEqually groundless and absurd are the apprehensions\nof social equality in the South.\n\"No, the race problem with us is not a political\none, nor one of social status but a tremendous labor\nproblem, gravely and seriously affecting and influencing\nthe great movement for the industrial and\nagricultural development of our State.  And its wise\nsolution, so as to produce the best results for our\nState, is of vastly more importance than that aspiring\nstatesmen should be elected to office to gratify\ntheir personal ambition.  The agitation at this\ntime is unfortunate.  Whatever may be the final\nresult, it will be construed by the Negro as a declaration\nof unfriendliness to his race.  It will carry\nwith it a stamp of unworthiness, and is hardly calculated\nto stimulate the Negro's esteem for the\nwhite man, or increase his confidence in his sense\nof fairness.\n\"If the Negro is to contribute his part to the industrial\ndevelopment of our State (and if he stays\nhere, he must), he will necessarily have to get\ngreat help, instruction and encouragement from  \nthe superior race.  He must be taught how to farm\nintelligently, whether he works for wages, as a \ncropper or a tenant, so that his labor may bring to\nhim a competent living, and to his employer peace \nand profit.  While he has many infirmities, he is\neasily controlled, quick to give his confidence in\nresponse to fair and just treatment, and is unusu-\n\n", "141", 127, 127, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00075", "Lorain Friday night to sing.

They will freely admit \nthat colored women should be included in the womanhood of the country.\nThey acknowledge that these women, but 40 years our of the most\ndegrading and dehumanizing slavery the world has ever seen need uplifting\ninfluences, helpful suggestions and high ideals. Then why did you vote\nto deprive them of the assistance and inspiration to be derived from\nmembership in the state federation? we ask. Because colored women are\nobnoxious to the white women of the South, is the reply.\nThe third reason against admitting colored women into the general federation \nis best expressed in the language of a prominent club woman in\nthe North, who kidly wrote me why she should vote to draw the color\nline, \"Knowing of your national organization\", she wrote, \"and the\npossible disruption of it, if clubs of your race were urged to become\na part of our national organization, I have never favored it\". But the \nfacts in the case do not warrant the conclusion reached by our friend\nwho is so anxious that our national association should be saved from\ndissolution. Ever since the general federation was organized, colored\nwomen have supposed that they could become members of it, since the\nconstitution does not forbid it. And yet, but one colored club had ever\nknocked for admittance until the colored delegate to the Milwaukee \nbiennial was denied her seat. Since that time only one colored club has\napplied for admission, so far as I have been able to ascertain.\nPrior to the Milwaukee episode no great organization of white women \nhad ever drawn the color line. For years colored women have been members\nof the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. The national council of \nwomen was hardly organized, before it extended a cordial invitation to\ncolored women to join its ranks. Owing to lack of funds the national\nassociation of colored women was not able to pay the membership fee of \n$100 until last winter before lasy, when it was received with open arms\n8\nby the executive committee of the national council which met in Minneapolis.\nThere is nothing in the constitution of the national American woman\nsuffrage association excluding colored women. For 12 years I have attended\nthe conventions held in Washington, and in all that time I have seen \nbut one colored delegate from a colored woman's club. This is called the \nsusan B? Anthony club, in honor of the great apostle of equal rights.\nand was formed in Rochester N.Y., her home. It is evident that white \nwomen's organizations have not heretofore been overrun by colored women\nclamorous for admission. In the past colored women who were intelligent\nand progressive enough to desire to avail themselves of the help\nreceived from organization have devoted most of the time and means at\ntheir command in building up their own national association.\nWith the exception of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, which has\nmade a special effort to enlist our women in its work, very few colored\nwomen belong to any national body of white women. None of our white\nfriends who honestly desire to do the best thing for us need do\nviolence to their conscience, therefore, by voting to exclude colored\nwomen from the general federation, so as to save our national association \nfrom destruction. Humiliating colored women for their own good is not\nat all necessary in this particular case.\nBut why are colored women so anxious to enter the general federation at \nthe present time, when they have failed to avail themselves of its aid \nand inspiration in the past? There are many reasons why this is true.\nI shall mention but one.two.

John H. Grant \n\nBy our daily papers and observations we\nare constantly being reminded that a crisis\nis approaching the American people.  Every\nman of common observation must be aware \nof the fact (particularly in Memphis) that \ndesperadoes and murderers among Negroes \nare on the increase.  There are evidently\ncauses at work, which, if not checked, will\ncontinue to increase this tribe to our great\nsorrow.  Public opinion should be centered \nupon these causes with a force which can\nneither be evaded nor repulsed.  I call the\nattention of Southern white men to this\nfact.  Free discussion of their treatment of\nthe Negro is the only method of eliciting\ntruth and establishing facts.  It is the great\nmanufactory of public opinion, which is the \nsupreme law of the land.  Every question, \nwhether of local or national notoriety, must\nbe submitted to it and decided by it.  If\nthe Southern white man wants this question\nsettled, and settled righteously and\nhonestly, he must not attempt to shut the\nNegro's mouth by intimidation or to arrest\nthe progress of discussion by his actions\ntoward the Negro.  The Negro man must be \npermitted to speak in his own defence.\nFor without a free interchange of sentiment\nthere cannot be such an enlightened understanding\nof the subject as will lead to a \nrighteous decision.  Let us ever remember \na practice that will not bear investigation\nis always liable to suspicion.  The interest\nof all, white and black, is in this great race\nquestion, and it needs not the spirit of\nprophecy to foretell, that unless it is amicably\nsettled, a crisis is approaching which\nwill involve the whole country and come\nhome to every man's bosom.  As one who \n\nclaims an interest in the welfare of his\ncountry and the uplift of his race, not\nexceeded by that of the white man--one\nwho possesses the same freedom of opinion \nand right of discussion as that of the white\nman;  as one having the same interest in\nthe issue, and accountable to the same tribunals\nhere and hereafter, I take the liberty \nto make such remarks upon your treatment\nof my people, and offer such views upon \nyour mistreatment of a helpless people, as\nreflection and experience have suggested.\nIn doing this, I shall use great plainness of\nspeech.  But be assured,, I have no sinister\ndesigns to accomplish;  no feelings of\nenmity to gratify;  and God forbid that I\nshould cast any stumblingblock in the way \nto impede the progress of truth, justice and\nbenevolence.  Why the Negro is becoming\nso daring (particularly in Memphis) in\nresisting the officers of the law, even to the\nkilling of them, is a question of absorbing\ninterest, and the duty of every good citizen\nis to find the cause and point it out.  The\nobject of this paper will be to state facts\nconcerning some of these evils, and to offer\na remedy.\nIt appears that a decree has gone out\namong the police of Memphis to the effect\nthat all Negroes must be off the streets\nbefore midnight.  On the night of the 14th\ninst. two young Negro men, who were late\ngetting off from their work at the Hotel\nGayoso, were overtaken by officers of the\nlaw, one between Orleans and Synthia on\nLinden Street, and the other on the corner\nof Wellington and Union Streets, and\nbeaten unmercifully, after which they were \npermitted to go on their way.  This habit \n\n\nSOME OF THE EVILS, &c.     545\n\nof clubbing Negroes by officers of this city \nis as common as walking down the street.\nI protest against this treatment of my people\nwith all the power of my soul.  The\npolice of this city have reached a point that\nthey seize a Negro at their own will and\npleasure;  become accuser, witness and\njudge, and subject him to punishment\nagreeable to their own will.  This is certainly\nan extraordinary power entrusted to\nmen whose first duty is to keep peace\nbetween all men;  but instead of keeping\nthe peace they are the advance agents of\ntrouble.  The Negro's rights surely ought\nto be better protected.  As the white man\nhas the administering of the law in his\nhands, it is his duty to guarantee as well as \npossess liberty and fair play.  This condition\nin the city of Memphis is a sad commentary\nupon the white man's boasted love\nof an equal chance for all human beings,\nthat the Negro must ask justice as a favor,\nand not demand it as a common right of\nevery citizen.  As an appendage to this\nvile treatment the Negro race is held up\nthrough the press of this city as a monster \nof cruelty and impurity.  I ask all honest\nmen, what can be reasonably expected from \nmen who have a taste of freedom under\nsuch treatment?  Be honest and true to\nyour inner-self when you answer this question.\nDon't think that the smothered manhood\nof the Negro will never assert itself at\nthat which you would die a thousand times\nfor, before you would endure it one second. \nThe Negro cannot always see you manifest\nsuch a spirit of resentment when your\nrights are invaded without imbibing the \nsame spirit, especially when so much of\nyour blood is within his veins.  This treatment\nwill degrade any human being, and it\ndoes not become the intelligence, the justice,\nand the Christianity of the white race\nto treat the Negro, whom they regard as\nweak, childish and ignorant, as though he \nwas a brute, and as though his existence\n(the white man's) depended upon the \n\nextinction of the Negro, as a man.  So, if\nthe Negro is corrupt, it is because he has\nbeen corrupted;  if he is unamiable, it is \nbecause he has been spit upon, and made to\nfeel that no man careth for his soul.  Treat\nhim with as much gentleness and generosity \nas he has experienced harshness, and he\nwill be altogether a different creature.  The\nNegro cannot be forced to take this abuse,\nwithout deeply injuring the white man's\nmoral nature;  whatever else he may gain\nin an external way over the Negro, he will \nyet be short of the highest qualities that go \nto make a noble man, the greatest gift of\nGod. \nBut I wish to call your attention to this\nquestion in its national bearing.  The\nequality of men in essential things, in likeness\nof physical organization, in the attributes\nof body and mind, is too evident to\nadmit a doubt that God intended each to be\nfree and happy.  If this great principle,\nwhich lies at the very foundation of our \ngovernment, was acted upon by the American\nwhite man toward the Negro, Negroes\nwould not be worse in crime and in misery\nthan other Americans.  But alas! we are \nspeaking of a principle which has not influence\nupon the American mind when the\nNegro is in question.  The white man is\nvery sagacious to discover, and very prompt\nto insist on his own inherent rights and\nprivileges, but the equal rights of the Negro\nare not included in his process of reasoning.\nThis is wrong and the white man knows it.\nIf you (the white race) are God's stewards\nin dispensing justice to the other nations of\nthe earth, you are not faithful to the great\ntrust committed to your care.  You are \nyielding the high sentiments of honor and \nhumanity to the inexorable demands of a \nbrutalizing lust.

There are exceptions, but this is the rule. If the fight is brought about under circumstances that place each man on his merits, and the Negro happens to get the better of the affray and is afterwards arrested, if he seriously hurts the white man, nine times out of ten he is lynched. This has become such a law in the South that Negroes accept death in defying the officers of the law rather than fall in the hands of the law to be turned over to a murderous mob. He sees that the law is but a trap to catch him for men who act like wild beasts when they overtake their helpless victim. He realizes that there is no protection for him in the hands of officers, the result of which makes him desperate. This practice has so terrorized Negroes that they feel that it is death to be arrested after a serious fight with a white man; hence, they make a choice of being shot to death on the spot rather than be burned to death by a furious mob. And this is not for \"The Nameless Crime\" as the South has been pleased to shelter their hatred of the Negro under. Can we wonder at Negroes becoming desperadoes and murderers under such conditions? The wonder is, that we are not all such. \nLet us not mistake these facts when we attempt to show cause for Negroes becoming desperadoes. Who is responsible for this condition? What may we not expect of men who feel that there is no protection for them under the law? Read your answer in the bloody chapters of all history. I do not hesitate to say, stop this high-handed and fiendish disregard for humanity at any sacrifice. If need be, and it appears to be so, stop it at the expense of sending the Negro out of this country. To me it will be the less of two evils. The religion of Jesus Christ has accomplished great things and I believe it will go on accomplishing great things; but, as I see it, it is a failure in the South. \nI could see some hope for my people if this conduct was confined only to the older people; but it is not. Often the school children of this city will start after a Negro child and chase it and club it until it finds shelter from their sight; and the most hopeless thing about it is, they will laugh and rejoice as though they had been doing God's service. \nAnd now I wish to turn my attention to the remedy. What I have said, whether welcome or not, the children of the street know it to be true. And now what can be done to change present conditions? I can see but two ways out of the trouble, and I ask all to deeply and thoroughly weigh them. I am aware my judgment will be called in question, but to such persons as do call it in question I have only to say that a candid and thorough investigation of the subject has forced this conviction upon me, in spite of powerful and opposing prejudices to one of my own conclusions. The deliberate attention of the reader is invited to the facts and the reasons which will now be given for this conviction. There is a saying that \"A Negro must keep in his place,\" meaning that he must always be beneath a white man. Regardless to the Negro's taste, his education, his culture and refinement, the average white man believes that he should be content beneath him, though the white man be as ignorant of good breeding as the wildest jack in the forest. This assignment the Negro will never accept, and no amount of burning, and intimidation bu the enactment of laws, will make him do so; nor could any honest man expect it of him; it is impossible. Every Negro that would accept this as his due would by that very act, if by no other, prove himself unworthy the rights of a man. But, I repeat, they will never accept it willingly. You cannot assign the culti-\n\n\nSOME OF THE EVILS, &c. 547\n\nvated intellect to degradation; its place is appointed by the Divine Mind, and cannot be altered because it is covered by a black skin, however earnestly others may wish it so. Intelligence is God's Monarch and none can dethrone him. To my mind this proposition is clear; and how the white man can harmonize his way of thinking with that of his action I cannot understand. He says the Negro must be educated and he is helping to pay for it, and yet he expects him to be a willing slave. It cannot be; it is madness to expect it; and neither is it right to kill Negroes because they find themselves unable to submit to your inhuman treatment. You should ever remember that the harder you press a cultivated intellect the higher it will rise to resist the pressure. You cannot lift the Negro up and at the same time degrade him. We need not appeal to history or human science for the truth of this statement. Therefore, I contend that the white man should give the Negro his full rights as an American, or see to it that he is removed out of the country. If any man has earned full citizenship in America the Negro has. Let the press stop crying, that because a race ask for their rights under the constitution, they are asking for social equality. Not a word of it is true and it is beneath the dignity of a noble mind to say so. All the social equality comes from the white man. I point to the houses kept by Negro women exclusively for white men in this city as an evidence that you are the men that seek social equality and not Negro men.\nIf service, reputation, industry, and knowledge can make a man respectable, there are Negroes that are entitled to the highest respect; but you trample them under your foot in your madness, and at the same time impart the right of suffrage and citizenship to a degraded, ignorant foreigner who know nothing of American principles, and who is in every respect the Negro's inferior. This is not right and ye are my witnesses. \nAgain, you do not hesitate to come in the closest personal contact with the Negro, as long as he occupies the place of a servant; but you would sooner eat a snake than sit at the same table with the most cultured and refined, as a man. This spirit is not found in the religion proclaimed to others. You would have all Negroes religious according to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and as for yourselves, Christ and everything else may go if it demands of you human treatment of the Negro. What can the Negro hope for, who in addition to his exertions for personal advantage in the most unfavorable circumstances, has to combat every step with an unconquerable prejudice against his color. \nIn view of these facts, I cannot perceive how any honest man can want my people to remain in this country. If they cannot be accorded every right guaranteed by the constitution, let them go where they can stand erect in the fullness of manhood, and, in the face of the white man, behold a friend and an equal. Let them go where no laws can continually make them feel a bitter degradation. Let them go where they can assert their rights and rise to the dignity of free men. \nI turn my thoughts over to the public with the hope that they will stir your minds for good to both white and black. That strong language has been used, is freely admitted; that the sentiments addressed are more severe than truth and facts will warrant, will be cheerfully acknowledged, on conviction. The writer claims no exemption from the frailties or infirmities of humanity\u2014he only bespeaks the indulgence of wiser men, that the errors of the head may not be imputed to the heart.

His profession was one\nin which he had learned early \nto keep his counsel and to regard as sacred\nany confidence reposed in him.  Accordingly\nhe was very highly esteemed and very\ngreatly trusted.  More than ever, after Ned\nhad gone to Cuba, Louisa Cranston may be\nsaid to have leaned upon Dr. Coe.  He had\nbeen practicing in the Cranston family long\nbefore Louisa was born, and she had\nalways looked upon him as a father.  But\ntrue to his habit, Dr.Coe avoided discussing\nLouisa's personal affairs.  This reticence\non his part worried Louisa somewhat.\nFinally one day, nerving herself for the\ntask, Louisa spoke to him of the absence of\nNed and Charles. \n\"If anything can cure Ned of his narrowness\nand sectionalism, I think this war\nwill.

Reduced\nto their lowest terms, however, it is easy to see that\nthe only difference which exists between them is\nthe name.  The same difference exists between\nvulgar polite dealing in futures, of which they generally\napprove.\nMeddling is the mother of discovery and invention.\nIt is the desire to handle or get close to\nsomething with which one is not familiar, so as to\nlearn something which he does not know.  For inventions\nand labor-saving machinery of all kinds\nare directly and solely indebted to the meddler.\nThere are also other fields of usefulness, in which\nthis much abused individual has made himself indispensible.\nHe is a friend worth having.  Those \n\nwho wish to rise rapidly in the world can do no\nbetter thing than find the biggest meddler in town\nand bind him to their hearts with hoops of steel. \nTheir success in life will then be assured.  They\nwill scarcely achieve it, however, on flowery beds\nof ease.  No rose is without its thorn and no meddler\nwithout his fault.  He is apt to be exciting\nnew and then, particularly, when he is in the\nthroes of prophecy, or feels called upon to give\nadvice.  The meddler is nothing, if not solicitous,\nand, therefore, unduly apprehensive at times.  If \nhe is especially interested in a merchant, in nine\ncases out of ten, he will rush into his establishment\nsome fine day, tell the proprietor that business\nis going to rack and ruin, and that he is heading\nstraight for the poorhouse.  This sort of prophecy\nis never enjoyed by the victim.  For this reason\nthe meddler often gets himself disliked.  In\nspite of the shock to his nerves, however, the merchant\nin question is the gainer by the experience,\nwhether he is willing to acknowledge it or not.  If\nhis business methods are good, the jar he has received\nwill do him no serious harm.  After he\nregains his equilibrium, he will be more confirmed\nthan ever in the way he has already gone.  It will\ncertainly set him to thinking, which is the greatest\nservice that can be rendered by any man's best\nfriend.  If the jolt which the meddler gives leads\nthe merchant to see that his methods are bad, he\nhas no one but his majesty, the meddler, to thank, \nwhen he is rich enough to be at the head of a trust.\nIt would be interesting to know how many men\nhave been saved from bankruptcy and how many\nbrilliant business careers have been saved by the\ntimely words of a meddler.\nIn counting the benefits without number which\nthe meddler confers upon an ungrateful world, one\ncannot help wondering why this great benefactor\nof mankind is held in such repute.  There is, no\ndoubt, that the fault lies entire at the door of Webster's\nUnabridged.  This bulky volume is responsible\nfor the outrageous injustice perpetrated upon\none of humanity's best friends.  \"To meddle,\"\nsays Webster, \"is to interpose officiously,\" and a\nmeddler is described as a person \"who interferes,\nor busies himself with things in which he has no\nconcern.\"\nThis definition tickles the selfish old crustaceans\nto death, for they consider that it absolves them\ncompletely from all responsibility for their neighbor's \nwelfare.  Caring for nobody but themselves,\nthey gloat in ghoulish glee over a definition which \n\n\nTHE MISSION OF MEDDLERS     567 \n\npermits them to interpret any human interest in\none's neighbor as an \"officious interference in\nthings in which they have no concern.\"  They also\nroll the definition like a sweet morsel under their\ntongues, while they label as meddlers those who\nobey the scriptural injunction to love one's neighbor\nas himself.  When they see an unfortunate\nbrother going to rack and ruin, they simply let him \nslide down the incline without a word of warning.\nThey they thank the Lord loudly that they are not \nas other men are, meddlers and officious interferers.\nInhuman indifference to a brother's fate is called\n\"attending strictly to one's own business.\"  If an\nunusually courageous person insists that help\nshould be given to the victim either of his own\nmistakes or of a perverse fate, the man who boasts\nthat he never meddles will ask as did a certain\nother person whom we all know by reputation but\nwhom very few admire, \"Am I my brother's\nkeeper?\"\nThus it happens that wrongs are left unrighted,\ncrimes unpunished, mistakes unrectified and grief\nunassuaged, because the world is so dreadfully\nafraid of meddling.  There is no doubt that some\npeople who are eager to render assistance withhold\nit, because they have a genuine aversion to anything\nwhich even looks like officious interposition.\nIt is certain also that succor is denied the needy\nand distressed more often by those whose stony\nhearts and sordid spirits make them impervious to\nthe woes of the world than by those who are honestly\nafraid of meddling.\nAll meddlers are not helpful, of course.  Some \npreachers and humanitarians bungle their work \nand do more harm than good.  Any virtue under\ncertain circumstances may become a vice.  In \nspite, however, of the mistakes which some meddlers\nmade, in spite of the fact that some are actuated \nby base and unworthy motives, if statistics\ncould be gathered on the subject, the figures would\nshow, I am sure, that more hearts have ached and\nmore people have failed of success from the little\nrather than too much meddling.\nEverybody who has tried to advance the interests\nof the human race by redressing wrongs or by inaugurating\nreforms has first been called a meddler.\nAn acknowledged philanthropist or public benefactor\nmay be defined as a meddler, whose labors\nhave been crowned with success.\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison was warned not to meddle \nwith things which did not concern him, when\nhe began his crusade against slavery.  He and the\nother abolitionists were threatened with ruin and\ndestruction, if they did not attend to their own\naffairs.  But if Garrison, Phillips and Sumner had\nnot interferred with this peculiar institution and \n\nhad not persuaded others to do likewise, how long\nslavery would have continued to tortue its victims\nand disgrace the civilization of the United States\nit is difficult to tell.\nIn the United States there is an imperative need\nof meddlers today--active, insistent and fearless\nmeddlers who will spend their time investigating\ninstitutions, customs and laws whose effect upon\nthe citizens of any color or class is depressing or\nbad.  The crying need of the whole wide world is\nmeddlers.  In Great Britain, Ireland is waiting for\na large number of the aggressive, humane kind to\nappear.  In Russia the dumb, driven cattle made\nin the image of God, but reduced to the level of\nbrutes are in sore need of the meddler who has\nhere a great and glorious work to perform.  The\nRussian meddler should inquire and ask questions\nand interrogate those who are responsible for the\nthe outrages perpetrated upon helpless human\nbeings, until the oft repeated questions about\n\"other people's business\" so arouse the conscience\nand touch the hearts of the thoughtless, the indifferent\nand the wicked that the answer will be give\nin a general and complete redress of wrongs.  In\nRussia and Germany and elsewhere as well the\nJew needs the service of the meddler, who shall\nask why the narrow and vicious of all races and\ncreeds are permitted to pursue and persecute a\npeople whose ability and whose virtues are so conspicuos \nand whose hand is raised against none.\nIn the United States the field which the conscientious\nmeddler alone can work is surely white,\nbut the laborers are few.  Here the meddler should\ntake it upon himself to ask disagreeable questions\nabout the political corruption which makes a single\nwhite man in one section equal to seven in another,\nthe fundamental law of the land to the contrary \nnotwithstanding.  The meddler in the United States \nshould inquire why intelligent, worthy and well-to-do\ncitizens are denied the rights guaranteed\nthem by the constitution, because their complexion\nhappens not to be fashionable in the particular \nsection which treats them as peons and slaves,\nwhile men who are inferior to them both in intelligence\nand respectability are cheerfully granted all\ntheir rights, privileges and immunities, simply because\ntheir faces are white, although it is through\nno effort, or merit or prowess on their part that\nthis desirable complexion has been secured.  In\nthe United States there is an imperative need of a \nhost of meddlers who will carry out Webster's\ndefinition of themselves to the letter and go so far\nas \"to interfere officiously,\" if need be, where corruption\nof any kind is apparent and the transgression\nof the law is clear.\nThe path of meddlers with a benevolent purpose \n\n", "161", 127, 127, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00096", "(upper left corner)\nHaven't had a letter\nfrom you for quite\nawhile.\n\n(upper right corner)\n2956 Edgehill Drive\nL.A. 16, Calif.\nApril 23, 1949\n\nDearest Mother,\nCarlos and I received that delicious\nVelati's and thank you very\nmuch for it - also our lovely cards.\nI did not even send you a card\nbut believe me when I say that\nI have been in such a daze and\ntizzy that Easter slipped up on me\nbefore I realized it!

The Artists' Ball which American\ngirls and I attended in Berlin had prepared me for anything which Europe\nand are accustomed to do at such a function., so I was surprised neither at\nsome of the bizarre, [costumes] not to say risque costumes which were worn nor at some\nof the outlandish favors which were presented to the guests.\n     \nHow I reveled in the treasure-filled art galleries of Florence, especially\nthe Pitti and Uffizi, where I literally entered a new world.  The marvelous\ncanvasses of the old masters fascinated me and I stood long hours gazing\nat them with thought of getting tired.  I was greatly encouraged when finally\nI could recognize who painted certain pictures the minute I glanced at them\nbecause I had learned the touch and the characteristics of the artists who\ndid them.  It was easy to identify Botticelli and Fra Angelica's pictures,\nbecause they were literally \"so different from the rest.  Carlo Dolci's madonnas\nappealed to me strongly.  I studied Raffael's paintings carefully and\nconscientiously to see whether I could detect for myself in what their perfection\nconsisted.  I bought a portrait of Raffael which was copied from the\noriginal painting he had made of himself.\n     \nThe story told about a portrait of Carlo Dolci interested me greatly.\nA certain French king who visited Italy saw him deeply absorbed in painting\na picture one day, and requested that the artist paint one of himself just as\nhe looked when he was at work.  The request was complied with and I bought a \nsmall copy of this portrait which Carlo Dolci painted of himself by looking\ninto a mirror, so that me might catch the expression of his face, as he worked.\n     \nThese two small portraits of Raffael and Carlo Dolci have hung in my home\never since I have had one.  I have also enjoyed looking at some Madonnas\nwhich appealed to me strongly as a girl and which have intermittently adorned\nthe walls of my home.\n     \nMost of my time in Florence was spent in studying Italian, in visiting\nthe wonderful art galleries, [and] in seeing the marvellous treasures of all kinds\nin which the city abounds and in taking very long walks about the city as\nwell as in the suburbs.  If I wanted to walk anywhere alone within a distance\n\n\n59\n\nof 8 or 10 miles, I did not hesitate to do so.  It never occurred to me that\nany danger would overtake me no matter how few people I met on the road.\n     \nWhile I lived in Florence I especially enjoyed visiting the places and\nseeing the pictures mentioned by George Eliot in her incomparable Romola.\nI found an edition of two small volumes bound in white trimmed in red in which\nunmounted photographs had been pasted on a page and inserted opposite the passages\nwhich they illustrated.  As, book in hand, I went from place to place to\nsee a picture or to stand on the very spot on which a certain character stood\nI felt that I was walking and talking with the great novelist herself.\n     \nThe monasteries and the nunneries were a never-failing source of interest\nto me.  I never tired seeing the monks themselves and the great stone [stru]\nstructures hoary with age in which they lived and moved and had their being.\nI acquired the habit of going into the beautiful, old Catholic churches several \ntimes a day.  The architecture, the pictures and the atmosphere of those\ngrand old structures lifted me out of myself and directed my thoughts up-ward\nfrom the material and sordid affairs of the earth.\n     \nOne morning about two o'clock I received a cablegram from my father telling\nme that he would leave Memphis on a certain date to take a steamer in New\nYork and spend the summer in Europe.  He landed at Bremerhafen and came on to\nFrankfort-on the Main where I met him.  He had brought the whole family with \nhim- his wife, Robert about four years old and little Annette who was only \ntwo.  I immediately took charge of my little sister, and let Father do the honors\nfor the young brother.  I had mapped out a delightful itinerary of several\nmonths, not knowing the children would be members of the party.  And although\ntheir strength was not overtaxed, it was surprising how little of my program\nhad to be revised or eliminated and how much of it was carried out as originally\nplanned in spite of the presence of two small children.\n     \nFirst, we went from Frankfort on the Main to Heidelberg, not only\nto see that wonderful old castle which had been nearly destroyed by Napoleon,\nbut to take a package to a young woman who was studying there.

And yet colored\npeople are doing this thing in droves every\nyear.  It requires neither voluminous knowledge\nnor great profundity to comprehend \nwhy some colored people are tempted to pursue\nsuch a questionable course.\nLet us take a colored man, for instance,\nwho is fairly well educated and is ambitious\nto make his way in the world.  There are \ncomparatively few trades open to colored \npeople.  These are generally overcrowded,\nwhich means poor pay.  The officials of some\nof the labor organizations are not lying \nwake nights devising ways and means of adding\nnegro workmen to their ranks, to say the\nleast.  Our colored friend determines to be\nhonorable, whatever he does.  Several times\nhe has answered advertisements and has \nbeen virtually employed.  After the matter\nof wages and duties has been settled he has \nstated frankly that he is colored.  Then his\nservices were quietly but quickly dispensed \nwith.  For a long time he knocks first at one\ndoor and then another, which he discovers\ncan be opened only by a white man's hand.\nHe becomes discouraged.\n*  *  \nBeginning the Transformation.\n\"What a curse it is to be a negro in this\ncountry,\" he mutters.  Suddenly he looks\ninto the mirror.  He has a fair skin and\nstraight hair.  Something asserts itself.\nThere are those who say it is his white blood.\n\"What's the use of trying to row against\nthe tide?\" he asks himself.  \"Nobody but a \ngiant can accomplish the impossible, and I\nam not a giant.\"\nThe long, lingering look in the mirror occurred, \nlet us say, Tuesday evening at 8 \no'clock.  Wednesday morning, at precisely\nthe same hour, he is a white man, made so\nby virtue of last night's decision and nature's\ngifts.  He isolates himself completely.\nHe scrapes up acquaintances with nice\npeople, who do not suspect he has the fatal\ndrop.  Finally, he gets a job which pays\nhim well and which it would be possible for\nhim neither to have nor to hold if his employer \nknew the truth.  Nonsense, says one.\nIf an employer secures the services of a competent\nman he is not going to stand in his\nown light by casting him adrift simply because\nhe is slightly connected with the negro\nrace.  But the facts are against such a supposition.\nI am personally acquainted with three\ncolored women, two of them young and one\nmiddle aged, who are all competent and\nbeautiful, and who were discharged from excellent\npositions simply because the employer\ndiscovered that they were colored. \n\nCuriously enough, two secured positions in\ndepartment stores in the cities in which\nthey were living at the time.  Each one lived\nwith her own family and associated with \nher colored friends, though the latter did not\nmake themselves especially conspicuous at\nthe respective stores in which the colored\nclerks were employed. The middle aged woman\nwas at the head of the cloak department in\na large store in New York City.  She held\nthis responsible position for several years\nbefore the secret leaked out.  When it percolated\nto her employer she was promptly\ndischarged.  This woman is as beautiful as a \npicture, and looks like a Madonna.\n*  *  \nPrejudice Too Strong. \nOne of the young women went first to New\nYork to win her spurs.  Armed with a most\ncomplimentary recommendation from the\nlarge firm which employed her in New York,\nshe came to her home in Washington to seek\na similar position.  The proprietor of a large\nestablishment in the capital of the nation\nwas only too glad to secure the services o\nso competent a young woman, and she, too,\nwas placed in the cloak department.  She was \nsuddenly discharged one day.  At her request \nI went to intercede with the proprietor in her\nbehalf.  He was perfectly honest and frank\nabout the matter.  He admitted without\nhesitation that she was one of the best saleswomen \nin the store.  He regretted deeply, he\nsaid, that he had been obliged to discharge\nher.  \"But, are you not master of your own\nstore?\" I ventured to inquire.  \"There was\nno other course to pursue,\" he insisted.  \"for\na long time,\" said he, \"the salesgirls complained\nbecause I had placed a 'nigger' in\nthe store.  I denied that she was colored at\nfirst.  I did not know she was myself, until I\nhad investigated the matter.  They themselves\nbrought me indisputable proof of the\nfact.  'Well, if you don't care to work in the\nstore with Miss Jones,' said I 'you may\nleave.'  Then they told my customers about\nit.  Delegation after delegation of white\nwomen came down to protest against my employing\na 'nigger' saleswoman in the store.\nThey threatened to boycott me, and made\nthings so hot for me that I was forced to dismiss\nMiss Jones in self-defense.  Now, if my\nbusiness had been in New York, I should\nhave kept her anyhow.\"  But I thought of\nthe fate of the beautiful and competent forewoman\nwho had been discharged in the New\nYork department store because she was remotely\nconnected with the despised race.\n*  *  \nFatal Drop Costs Position. \nThe last of the three cases which came\nunder my observation was similar to the\nfirst two.  A young colored woman in Washington,\nwho did not show the slightest trace\nof her African ancestry, was made forewoman\nin a fashionable tailor establishment\nfor ladies.  Her employer discharge her,\nalso, when he learned that the fatal drop \n\nwas coursing somewhere in her veins.  Perhaps\nno one of these colored women would\nhave received her walking papers if the\nemployer had been unable to fill her place.\nBut it is difficult to find a trade or a vocation \nin which the workmen are so few that a \nplace cannot be satisfactorily filled.  These \ncases will show why some colored people are\ntempted to become white.\nEven though there is absolute certainty\nthat the chances of success are greater for a \ncolored person who forswears his race than \nfor the same individual if he remains loyal to\nit, the vast majority do not yield to the\ntemptation of passing for white.  No better \nproof of this could be cited than the case of\na young woman with whom I am personally\nacquainted.  She is the daughter of one of\nthe most courageous and prominent colored\nmen whom this country has produced.\nThough she is not as fair as a lily, she might\neasily pass for white, if she chose to do so.\nShe has an exquisite complexion, modeled\nafter the Spanish or French.  Her hair and\neyes are as black as midnight.  She has a \nsuperb musical education.  She married a\nyoung physician, who can also pass for\nwhite.  They went to an eastern city, where \nthe doctor has a large and lucrative practice.\nHe decided that he would shake off the body\nof the dusky death, so to speak, and cast his\nlot with the dominant race.  When he revealed\nhis plans to his wife she told him she\nwould rather live on a small income and be\nloyal to her race than have a large one, if she\nwere obliged to live a perpetual lie and forsake\nfamily and friends.  The husband could\nnot be shaken from his purpose and the wife\ncould not be persuaded to renounce her race.\nThey agreed to separate on this account.\n*  *  \nCut Their Negro Friends.\nIt it amusing to see some of the daughters\nand sons of Ham, after the metamorphosis\nhas become an all accomplished fact.  To \nsome of us who have been reared with them\nit is disgusting, perhaps.  \"Do you see that\nman over there?\" asked one of my friends \nwith whom I happened to be on the street\ncar not long ago.  \"Well, that lady sitting\nbeside him is his wife.  He is colored, but\nshe is white.\"  \"Are you sure he is colored?\" \nsaid I, doubting Thomas like; \"he certainly\ndoes not look so.\"  \"I ought to be,\" he answered;\n\"he and I played together when we\nwere children.  At Gen. Grant's funeral in\nNew York we occupied the same room in the\nhotel.  All of a sudden, a short while after\nthat, he decided to be white, and tried to persuade\nme to do the same.  He cut himself\nloose from all his colored friends, acquired\nwhite ones, and now he is completely on the\nother side.\"\nJust then the eyes of the two men met, and\nthey bowed pleasantly to each other.  \"That\nman is an exception,\" said my friend.\n\"When the average colored person passes\nfor white he cuts all his old colored friends\ndead, for fear of arousing suspicion among \nthe white ones, I presume.\"  The man who\nrelated the incident told me that at least 100 \nof his own relatives and friends from South \nCarolina had moved north, east, and west,\nand \"gone over on the other side,\" as he\nexpressed it.\nOn account of the Jim Crow car laws, the\nimpossibility of securing accommodations at\nthe hotels, and because of other hardships \nmany fair colored people leave the south\nevery year and move north, where they lose\ntheir identity completely.  Years ago, during\nslavery, white masters, who loved their\ncolored children too dearly to shackle their\nlimbs and dwarf their minds, introduced this\nfashion of making black white by sending\nthem north or to Europe to be educated as\nwhite.\n*  *  \nPosed as a Hindoo.\nIt might not create surprise to learn that\nit is possible for colored people, who look\nlike caucasians, to palm themselves off as\nwhite on a northern community.  It would\nastound some, however, to hear that the feat\nis sometimes performed in the south, where\nthe whites are supposed to have a patent on \ndetecting \"the man and brother,\" no matter \n\n\n[*Boston Herald  Nov. 19, 1905*]\n\nWHERE BLACK\nBECOMES WHITE \n\nMary Church Terrell Tells How\nMembers of Her Race Abjure\nFriends and Family to\nJoin \"the Other Side.\"\n\nLIVING AS MEMBERS OF \nTHE CAUCASIAN TRIBE\n\nEffect of the \"Jim Crow\" Laws\nin the South, Many Colored\nMen Being Forced to Seek\nNew Homes in the North.\n\n[From Our Special Correspondent.]\nWASHINGTON, D. C., Nov. 18, 1905.\nIT'S just as easy as falling \noff a log.\"  This is\nwhat our friend tells us,\nwhen he wishes to show\nwhat little effort is required\nto bring a certain\nthing to pass.  But falling\noff a log is really difficult feat\ncompared with the ease with which colored\npeople in this country are sometimes\ntransformed into white. \nAt first blush it would seem that a\ncamel with a hump could literally pass\nthrough a cambric needle's eye easier \nthan an individual tainted with even a\ndrop of the fatal African tincture could\npalm himself off as a bona fide white\nman in the United States.  And yet colored\npeople are doing this very thing in\ndroves every year.  It requires neither\nvoluminous knowledge nor great profundity\nto comprehend why some colored\npeople are tempted to pursue such\na questionable course.\nLet us take a colored man, for example,\nwho is fairly well educated and is\nambitious to make his way in the\nworld.  There are comparatively few\ntrades open to colored people. These are\ngenerally overcrowded, which means \npoor pay.  The officials of some labor\norganizations are not spending sleepless\nnights devising ways and means of\nadding negro workmen to their ranks.\nOur colored friend determines to be honorable.\nSeveral times he has been virtually\nemployed, but he has stated\nfrankly that he is colored.  Then his\nservices were quietly but quickly dispensed\nwith.  For a long time he knocks \n first at one door and then at another,\nwhich he finds can be opened only by a\nwhite man's hand.  He becomes discouraged.\n\"What a curse it is to be a negro in\nthis country!\" he mutters.  Suddenly he\nlooks into the mirror.  He has done\nthat before, perhaps.  He has always\nbeen identified with the struggling race,\nbut he has a fair skin and straight hair.\nSomething asserts itself.  There are\nthose who say that it is his white blood \n\n\"What's the use of trying to row\nagainst the tide?\" he says.  \"Nobody\nbut a giant can accomplish the impossible,\nand I am not a giant.\"  There \nis a bitterness in his tone, as he soliloquizes,\nand discouragement is written\non his face.  He quickly reaches a decision.\nHe has thought of it before.\nHe has always put it behind him, however,\nas a last resort, too contemptible\nand cowardly to be considered seriously.\nBut--he is out of work now and he has\nbeen in that condition for a long time.\nInability to get a good position has become\nchronic. \nThe long, lingering look in the mirror\noccurred, let us say, Tuesday evening at\n8 o'clock.  On Wednesday morning, at \nprecisely the same hour, he is a white\nman.  Made so by virtue of last night's\ndecision and nature's gift.\n\"Impossible,\" says one. \"That is only\na dream or a fairy tale.\"  But what is\ndone almost every day is not impossible.\n\"Where does he go?\" asks another?  If \nthe man happens to have a family in the\ncity, and the city is large, he stays right\nthere, in many instances.  How does he\ndo it?  Among other things he ceases to\nfrequent his old resorts.  He changes his\nlodging house, and betakes himself to a\nportion of the city diametrically opposite\nto the one in which he formerly \nlived.  His old friends see him no more;\nthat is, they don't if he can help it.\nWhen he sees them approaching he\nmakes it convenient to cross to the\nother side of the street.  He isolates\nhimself completely.\n\nHe Gets a Well-Paying Job.\nHe scrapes up acquaintance with some\nwhite people, who do not suspect that\nhe has the fatal drop.  Finally, he gets\na job, which pays him well, and which\nit would be impossible for him either\nto have or to hold if his employer knew\nthe truth.\nNonsense, you say.  If an employer\nsecures the services of a competent man,\nhe is not going to stand in his own\nlight by casting him adrift, simply because\nhe is slightly connected with the\nnegro race.  But the facts are against\nsuch a supposition.  If the employer discovers,\nby hook or crook, that he has\nemployed a colored man by mistake, in\n99 cases out of 100 he will discharge him\nimmediately.  There are undoubtedly \nexceptions to this rule, though I, myself,\nhave never heard of one.\nI am personally acquainted with three\ncolored women, two of them young and\none middle-aged, who are competent and\nbeautiful, and who were discharged\nfrom excellent positions simply because\nthe employer discovered that they were \ncolored. \nIt must be said to the credit of the\nwomen just mentioned that they did not\nsecure their positions under false pretences.\nThey might have deserved their\nfate if they had. No one of them labelled\nherself \"colored,\" to be sure, when she\nwent to seek the place.  Self-preservation\nis still the first law of nature. Each\none went on her own merits, and secured\na fine position for the same reasons\nthat a white girl would have obtained\none, and adopted the same methods\nthat a white girl would use under\nsimilar circumstances.  Each one was\neminently successful in her special\nwork, according to the testimony of the\nemployer.\nCuriously enough, two secured positions\nin department stores in the city in\nwhich they were living at the time.  In\nthe mean time each one lived with here\nfamily, and associated with her colored\nfriends, though the latter did not make\nthemselves especially conspicuous at the\nrespective stores.  The middle-aged\nwoman was at the head of the cloak department\nin a large store in New York\ncity.  She held this responsible position\nfor a long time before the awful secret\nleaked out.  When it percolated to her\nemployer, however, she was promptly \ndischarged.  The woman is as beautiful\nas a picture, and looks like a Madonna.\n\nColored Women Barred Out.\nOne of the young women went first to \nNew York to win her spurs.  Armed\nwith a most complimentary recommendation\nfrom the large firm which employed \nher in New York, she came to \nher home in Washington to seek a position \nhere.  The proprietor of the \nWashington establishment was only too\nglad to secure the services of so competent\na young woman, and she, too\nwas placed in the cloak department.\nShe was suddenly discharged one day \n\nAt her request I went to intercede\nwith the proprietor in her behalf, who\nhappened, by the way, to be a Hebrew.\nIt seemed unreasonable and cruel that\na Hebrew should discharge any one\nsimply on account of race.  He was perfectly\nhonest and frank about the matter.\nHe admitted without hesitation\nthat she was one of the best saleswomen\nin the store.  He regretted\ndeeply that he had been obliged to discharge\nher. \n\"But, are you not master in your own\nstore?\" I ventured to suggest.\n\"There was no other course to pursue,\"\nhe insisted.  \"For a long time,\" \nsaid he, \"the salesgirls complained because\nI had placed a colored girl in the\nstore.  I denied that she was colored. \nThey brought me indisputable proofs of\nthe fact.  'Well, if you don't care to\nwork in the store with Miss Jones,' said \nI. 'you may leave.'  After that they told\nmy customers about it.  Delegation after\ndelegation of white women came down\nto protest against my employing a colored\nsaleswoman in the store.  They\nthreatened to boycott me, and made\nthings so hot for me that I was forces\nto dismiss Miss Jones in self-defence.\nNow, if my business were in New York,\nI should keep her anyhow.' \"\nBut I thought of the fate of the colored\nforewoman who had been discharged \nin the New York department \nstore.\nThe last of three cases which came\nunder my observation was similar to\nthe first two.  A young colored woman\nin Washington, who did not show a\ntrace of her African ancestry, was made\nforewoman in a fashionable tailor establishment\nfor ladies.  Her employer\ndischarged her also when he learned\nthat the fatal drop was coursing\nthrough her veins somewhere.\nIt is conceivable that no one of these\ncolored women would have received\ntheir \"walking papers\" if the employer\nhad been unable to fill their places.  It\nis difficult to find a trade, however, in\nwhich the workmen are so few that a \nplace cannot be filled.  These cases will\nshow why some colored people are\ntempted to be white.\n\nA Colored Family Divided.\nEven though there is absolute certainty\nthat the chances of success are\ngreater for a colored person who foreswears\nhis race than for the same individual\nif he remains loyal to it, the\nvast majority do not yield to the temptation\nof passing for white.  No better\nproof of this fact could be cited than\nthe case of the young woman with\nwhom I am personally acquainted.  She\nis the daughter of one of the most courageous\nand prominent colored men that\nthis country has ever produced.  Though\nshe is not very fair, she could easily\npass for white, if she chose to do so. \nShe has an exquisite complexion, modelled\nafter the Spanish or French.  Her \nhair and eyes are as black as midnight.\nShe has a superb musical education.\nShe married a young physician  wh\ncan also pass for white.  They when to\nan eastern city, where the doctor has\na large and growing practice.  He suddenly\ndecided that the would shake off\nthe body of the dusky death, so to\nspeak, and cast his lot with the dominant\nrace.  When he revealed his plans\nto his wife, she told him that she would\nrather live on a small income, if necessary,\nthan have a large one if she were \nobliged to forsake her family and\nfriends.\nThe husband could not be shaken from\nhis purpose, and the wife could not be\npersuaded to turn her back on her family,\nso they separated.  She went South\nand he remained in the eastern city.\nWhen I see this accomplished young\nwoman, as I often do, and her little\ndaughter, who is as fair as a snowdrop\nwondering how the husband and father\ncould have summoned the strength and\ncourage to bid them good-by.\n\nCases of Black Made White.\nIt is very amusing to see some of the\nsons and daughters of Ham, after the\nmetamorphosis has become un fait accompli.\nTo some of us, who have grown\nup with them, it is disgusting, perhaps.\n\"Do you see that man over there?\"\nsaid one of my friends with whom I\nhappened to be on a street car not long\nago.  \"Well, that lady sitting beside\nhim is his wife.

She seldom \nattended service in the morning, because Sunday was the big dinner day\nand the large pot was invariably put into the little one, as as to tickle \nthe pallet of the family for whom she had cooked [nearly] more than forty years.\n    Until she was fifteen Aunt Ann had nursed all [more] the children of the Pinckney \nfamily to whom she was sold when a child. At the death of old Aunt \nJane who had cooked for the Pickney\u2019s a life time and had acquired a reputation \nas mistress of her art all over Georgia, it was discovered that \nAnn was the only slave on the plantation young or old to whom the famous\ncool had imparted the secrets of some of her wonderful dishes. So Ann was\nforforth transferred from the nursery to the kitchen. As between having \na good cook and a good nurse, the wise always know how to choose. Anybody\nwill do to nurse children, but not everybody can cook.\n\tFrom her[piety]  childhood Ann had been noted for her pioty. As surely as \nSunday night came, just so certainly would she be found in the Amer corner \nof the African Methodist Episcopal Church. No member encouraged the \npreacher with more earnest and frequent exclmations of approval than did \nAunt Ann. His sermons were thickly interlarded with her commands to \u201cPreac\nit, Brudder, and with proofs of her confidence in his ability displayed by \nsuch expressions as \u201cDat\u2019s de truf. Go on, my Brudder, I knows you knows it.\nBless de lovin Gawd, how de preacher do talk, varied occasionally with \nsuch imprecations as \u201cLawd, help de po sinner on Jedgment Day.\u201d\tBut revival \nservices were Aunt Ann\u2019s specialty. Among the members of the St. Paul\u2019\nA.M.E. Church nobody was more dreaded by the sinners than was Aunt Ann-\nthe deacons and the preacher himself no expected. When she started toward\n\n\n4\nthe back part of the church where the unregenerate usually congregated,\nthe conspicuously wicked would flee out of the door as if from the wrath\nto come, if they spied her in time to escape. It was an established fact\nthat if Aunt Ann ever talked with a sinner about his evil ways and fixed \nher fear-inspiring eyes upon him, while she painted in the lurid colors the \nroaring rod flame which would burn the unconverted forever and ever, he \nwould be glad to go to the mourner\u2019s bench. \t\t\u201cFall on your knees, po\nsinner,\u201d [she would say] Aunt Ann would exclaim in a solemn voice, when she had hobbled\nafter him to the mourner\u2019s bench, \u201cand pray Gawd Almight to save your everlastin \nsoul. Then kneeling beside him she would continue to paint the torments \nof the damned in language whose realism would put Dante\u2019s inferno\nto shame. Having administered what she considered a sufficient quantity\nof terror Aunt Ann would expatiate rapturously upon the joys of the redeemed, \nfor nobody understood better than she did how to balance the bitter\nwith the sweet. In St Paul Church, therefore, a revival service minus Aunt\nAnn was like the tragedy of Hamlet with the hero left out. It goes without\nsaying the Brother Johnson missed this active worker sorely and that the\nrevival was far from being a success. There was little enthusiasm among the \nmembers [xxx] themselves who were dispirited and awed by the absence of their\nleader of many years. At a conference called to discuss the matter Brother\nJohnson was urged to see Aunt Ann and beseech her to resume her activity\nin the church.\n\t\u201cMiss Pinckney\u201d, said Aunt Ann the day after the pastor\u2019s visit in\nthe kitchen, \u201cI wants to git off this afternoon befo dinner. \tMay Jane\nwill ten to ebry thing jes es same es ef I was here, case I done giv her\nall the structions.\u201d \tIf her old cook had struck her, Mrs. Pinckney \ncould hardly have been more shocked than she was at this most extraordinary \nrequest. But once before in twenty years had Aunt Ann asked permission \nto go off in the afternoon. \u201cYasm\u201d, she continued, \u201cI wants to go to see \nmy pastor on some pertickler business and I cant put it off no longer.\u201d", "14", 132, 132, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00068", "Wish I could have been there.\nWe are all quite well.

The author says Beecher\nwould never have come out strongly against slavery, if he had not thought it \nwas safe for him to do so. Of course it is possible to question any human being's\nmotive and to doubt his sincerity, if one wished to detract from his reputation\nand besmirch his character. The fact remains that Henry Ward Beecher\nwas a great power for good in the anti-slavery cause and our group should remember\nhim gratefully for that.\nBut the biographer does not stop at impugning Beecher's motives. He rakes up a \ndivorce scandal which fairly shook the foundations of society when the case\nwas aired in the courts. It is quite clear that although Henry Ward Beecher\nwas acquitted of the charge proffered against him, his biographer rather doubts\nthe justice of this verdict. Who will be the next idol to be smashed?\nGeorge Washington has already been held up to ridicule and scorn by a \nman who handles his subject without gloves, to say the least. According to this\nbiographer the Father of His Country was far from being the perfect gentleman\nand the great soldier he is usually represented to be. Of course the author\nof this uncomplimentary \"life\" of Washington has been severely criticized and\nloudly condemned for this shattering our cherished ideal. But what he has written,\nhe has written, and everyman may believe as much of what he reads as he\nchooses.\nAnd last, but not least, two books have been written to show the glaring \ndefects in the late President Harding's character and to emphasize the mistakes\nhe made. One of the books shows that the men he gathered around him to help him\nguide the \"Ship of State\" did a great deal to help him turn it in the wrong\ndirection and one is lead to believe that these men would have come pretty near\nwrecking it, if they had had their way. The latest book about this President is \nwritten by a woman who claims that he is the father of her child. She goes into\nthe minutest detail to establish her contention. She literally leaves no stone \nunturned to convince the reader that she is telling the truth. These unsavory\nrevelations must be very embarrassing to the family of the late President Harding.\n\n                                                       4\nEspecially must this be true since the woman refers repeatedly to the\nlate President's sisters, telling various conversations she has had with them.\nAn effort was recently made to present a play in Philadelphia based on\nthe book revealing Mr. Harding's conduct in the White House, but it was\ntaken off the stage, because it was considered too unpatriotic and too reprehensible\nthus to expose the mistakes and weaknesses of a President of the United\nStates. Since these books have had a wide sale, it is quite likely that\nthere will be a perfect deluge of them on the market. Authors eager to make\nmoney will be delving deeply into the private character of our heroes to see if\nthey can not find something scandalous to expose. None of our departed supermen\nwill be immune from their prenicious activity.\nWhat good will it do to expose the weaknesses and defects of our great \nmen? Will it encourage human beings who might otherwise despair of accomplishing\nsomething worthwhile, because they are oppressed with a sense of their weakness, \nto know that those regarded as heroes to day once struggled against defects \nas great and glaring as their own? If these books have that effect upon\npeople, they may do good. But if they cause us to lose faith in humanity on general\nprinciples and convert us into Doubting Thomases whenever we hear a great\n man's name called, these books will do unspeakable harm.\nAt any rate our group has the satisfaction of knowing that if its representatives\noccasionally make mistakes, they are not a white worse than are\nmany belonging to a group which has had centuries of training, education and\nadvantages far superior to their own.

The colored soldiers have fought with a patriotism\nand died with a courage surpassed by none. The first blood spilled for\nthe independence of this country was shed by a colored man. It was Crispus\nAttucks, a colored man, who first led the American patriots against British\ntroops, and who fought desperately for the independence of this country till\nthe enemy laid him low.\n\nYet, there is not a public building in the Capital of the Nation for\nwhich Crispus Attucks fought and died in which his statue or that of any other\nhero of African descent may be placed. In not a single building of the Federal\nGovernment may[c]colored people hang a picture or place a statue or bust of the\nrepresentatives of their group who have distinguished themselves in science,\nliterature, music, art or industry or in any other field of human endeavor.\n\nDuring the Sesquicentennial Exposition held in Philadelphia I took\npart in a pageant which was given in an auditorium that seated 16,000 people.\nEvery seat was occupied and scarcely standing room was left.\"Loyalty's Gift\"\nwas undoubtedly one of the finest evidences of the progress made by the color[e]ed \npeople of this country which has ever been witnessed.

The conditions under which\nthey travel are totally different from those which confront me.\"  She was talking\naloud with as much earnestness and intensity as though she were trying to\nexplain something of which she was ashamed but which circumstances forced her\nto do.  \"I love my mother and father as much as they do,\" she protested to herself,\n\"and I enjoy my home.  But getting there's the thing,\"  she repeated shaking her head.\n     Just then she heard a sharp rap at the door and before she could speak,\nNarka Davis rushed in.\n     \"You promised to give me a definite answer to day, and I've come to get \nit.  Betsy, Can you, will you, wont you spend the summer vacation with me?  I\nwant your Ladyship's answer this minute.\"\n     She was standing in front of Betsy eager and excited, patting her foot, as\nthe words rushed forth.\n     \"I really cant accept your invitation this summer, Narka, as much as I\nshould like to.  Mother is not well and needs me, so I must go home.\"\n     \"Here you are almost an old woman, with one foot in the grave from old age,\nso to speak,\" replied Narka with mock indignation, \"and you haven't seen the\nocean yet.  And think how many delectable ocean dips you'll miss.\"  \n     \"Please dont tempt me any more,\" Betsy pleaded, \"Even if you didn't live\nin God's country, as Guy Dorsey calls it, even if I didn't love you so much,\neven though I could not have a gay time and the salt water baths would do me\nno good, I assure you I would go with you , if I could.\"\n     \"There was just a slight break in Betsy's voice, but slight as it was, it\ncaused Narka to look closely into her friend's face.\n     \"What on earth's the matter with you, child?\"  she asked sympathetically.\n     \"Well, the truth of the matter is, I really dread to go home.  \"  She hesitated\na moment, as though she could not trust herself to proceed.\n\n 3\n\n     \"The journey from here to Magnolia is a hideous nightmare to me.  But let's \ndont talk about it, Narka.  Come on, let's take a walk.\"\n     From that time till she boarded the train for home Betsy refused even\nto refer to the disagreeable trip.  From Ralston to Cincinnati the journey\nwas delightful, but, when Betsy reached Cincinnati, it was necessary for her\nto change cars.  For a long time she debated whether she would go into the\ncoach set aside for white people, as soon as she boarded the train going South, \n or whether she should bet into the \"Jim Crow\" coach at once.\n     The Jim Crow car is made by dividing an ordinary day coach into two\nparts by means of a wooden partition.  A section consisting of three  or four\nseats on each side of the aisle is set apart for colored passengers and the remaining portion of the coach behind the partition is generally used as a smoker\nfor white men.  In spite of all the courage she could muster and in spite of\nall the philosophy she could bring to bear upon the situation, it was very hard\nfor Betsy to board the Jim Crow car at Cincinnati.  Not because she objected to\nriding with members of her own race, she insisted, but because it wounded her\nfeelings and crushed her pride to be thrust into the car solely on account of\nher color.  Moreover, she rebelled against the dishonesty and the unfairness\nof the railroads which sold her a first class ticket, but forced her to ride\nin a second or third class car.  Once she had actually protested to a railroad\nofficial, but he had told her curtly that for colored passengers the Jim Crow\ncar was considered first class.\n     After mature deliberation Betsy decided it would be less embarrassing for\nher to go directly into the coach set aside for members of her race than it\nwould be to take a seat in the first class coach and then be forced to cross\nthrough the smoker for white men into the Jim Crow car, the cynosure of all\neyes and, perhaps, the butt of ridicule and jests, after the train had gone only\na few miles from Cincinnati and crossed the State line into Kentucky.\n     As soon as she entered the car, she put her dress suit case on the rack\nabove the seat and resolved to make the best of a trying situation.

This is one of the natural show places of France and I have wanted to\ngo for a long time. It is situated on the Emerald Coast one hundred miles southest of\nCherbourg, and is three hundred seventy five miles from Calais. It is an island of solid\ngranite rock rising to about ninety feet at its summit. Formerly one reached it in boats\nbut now a wide promenade connects it to the mainland. A quaint town thrives on the tourists\nwho flock there. There is a beautiful Abbey begun in 700 and finished in the 15th century.\nThe museum is very interesting too. The peculiarity of the place is, that the house, Abbey\netc. are hewn right out of the rock itself. Lovely hand carving and Gothic architecture.\nWe left Calais on Saturday at one o'clock and stopped an half hour to refresh ourselves\nin Abbeville and arrived in Rouen at five o'clock.

The exact spot\nis marked by a status reproducing the scene. We stayed in a hotel just under the celebrated\nGrosse Horlage and its famous chimes disturbed our slumber somewhat.\nThe next morning at seven we were off to Lisieux where we stopped to visit the shrine\nof Sainte Therese. This took no less than three and one half hours, so many things there\nwere to see. Her tomb, her hill of miracles, the temple erected to her etc. There were\nliterally hundreds who had made the pilgrimmage on the Sunday morning that we were there.\nNext we moved on to Falaise and had lunch in the shadow of the Chateau where William\nthe Conqueror was born. From there we passed through what is known as Swiss Normandy. It\nis beautiful country and one can imagine oneself in Switzerland. This carried us through\nCrecy where the famous battle was fought and after this the dynamo of the car went wrong\nand we were delayed for two hours, arriving only at Mont St. Michel at 7 P. M. We saw\nthe sunset over the Mont which is equalled only by the sunrise as a scene of grandeur.

I have received scores of just such letters as these two \nI have sent you, recommending contracts, suggesting improvements \nand raises of rentals and making special rates; all greatly to our \nadvantage. I received at least one a week; sometimes two and \nthree. I believe Jim is becoming a bit restless and fretful. He \nwants to get out of the post office. He often tells me of the \nprobabilities he has in other lines. However, it is the only case on \nrecord, I ever heard of at least, of a man doing what he has done, \nincessantly and faithfully for charity. Of course, such work entails \non his part, while working in the post office, a great deal of hardship \nand self denial. It is certainly no pastime, pleasure or \nrecreation for him in doing what he has for us. He has raised that old stuff, as if by magic, from nowhere to a promising possibility; \nas I have often said, not with Van Court's assistance, but in spite \nof it. He has brought this property up from $300 per month to now \nover $1000. per month. Nor was this magic improvement due to any \nboom in Memphis. Most of these good and substantial rentals were \nprivate agreements that Jim dug up and brought in. It would be \nsuicidal for us to lose him. I believe that if Jim ran out on us, \nthe property would wither and decay under Van's carelessness, \nnegligence, incompetence and deception; as it did before Jim gave us a \nhand. Jim has made us all those contracts, such as those for big \nrentals, by making special agreements, recommending increases of", "15", 137, 137, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00022", "-2-\nrentals and promising tenants small improvements as a foundation\nfor increases. He and I have handled it very diplomatically from\ntime to time, as the monthly statements show. These two letters of\nJim's will give you some idea how incessantly and faithfully he has\nworked. We have already received thousands of dollars through his\ncare and assistance, we never would have received from Van Court.\nI think we should send Jim money every month, to encourage him\nin the good work and keep him pleased. He is really entitled to a \nregular salary, if justice were done. He mentions something in every\nletter now about getting a new job. He seems very restless and dissatisfied\nwith his condition. This might be a hint, that he has\ncommenced to realize, that his services are worth something more\nthan the sentiment expressed in the course of Bert Williams' famous\nsong, \"I am much obliged to you.\" Surely, it would be an awful\ncalamity to both of us, because of being petty, ungenerous or penurious,\nto deny Jim a small sum every month. Just as he has substantially made me feel the benefit of his assistance, we should make him feel the strength of our gratitude. I earnestly ask you,\nto look this situation squarely in the face and meet these conditions\nfairly, which would mutually benefit us. I am sure, that at the rate\nJim is going, he will still send that property higher up financially.\nI think he is very loyal and grateful by nature. Such a consideration\nas we could afford to send him every month, as a financial remembrance\nwould more than pay us, arouse in him more enthusiasm and interest, place\nus in a more independent attitude; it would certainly put him generally\nmore on his metal.\nI trust that you will consider this matter carefully and realize\nfully the urgent necessity of keeping Jim on good terms with\nour interests there. It would certainly not only be right and \nsquare, but would be extreme good business on our part.\n-3-\nFrom his letter, you see, he refers to the two offers from other\npersons. Van Court himself, is trying to get him. Van has found\nout by this time, Jim's sterling worth and reliability. God help\nus if Jim Wright should see fit to throw up the sponge.\nGive my love to all, and please let me have your \nanswer to this request. Kindly send those copies of letters to\nVan court and this letter of Jim Wright's enclosed herein back to\nme.\nFrom your devoted brother,\nThos. A.

Having plenty of property at our disposal, both getting\nold, while that junk is lying vacant and idle down there eating its head\noff and eating like a cancer into our peace and comfort. Now we should\nget to-gether and some how dispose of some of the idle stuff, which we \nnever expect to improve and which would be of great benefit to us both\nby being sold.

New York is wild about\nthem. Working on a double shift--, night and day----, they average $30.\nYou once asked me to send you a good horse sometimes, so that you could\nwin some money. Well the yellow taxicabs beat the horses a hundred\ndifferent ways. They never loose. The beauty of it is you do not need to\nknow anything about them---, the clock speaks for it self. the drive gets 1/3 of the fares. If your driver\nis not honest, get rid of him and get another the chauffeurs are crazy\nto drive them, they are the most beautiful cars; consist of the strongest\nmaterial and are all the go.

The opportunities which we had sought so earnestly \nand so long in vain were opening up unto us more and more day by day. \nStern necessity forced those who had so long closed the door of opportunity \nand hope in our faces to open wide the portals, so that many colored \npeople began to feel we would soon be living under some of the economic conditions \nfor which we had so devoutly prayed. \n        Many other reasons might be given to show why the majority of colored \npeople believed that their condition in this country would be materially \nimproved after War. First of all they really believed that the moral \nsense of the nation had been quickened, that its conscience had been aroused \nand its heart touched. They hoped that the lenders of this nation meant \nwhat they said and that they would exert themselves strenuously to establish \na Democracy in the highest and best meaning of the word, immediately \nafter the War. \n      The colored people of this country knew they had done everything in \ntheir power to ensure victory for the Allies. In proportion to population \nmany more colored soldiers were sent from the southern states than white men \naccording to their means they bought war stamps and thrift stamps than \nany other racial group. They made large contributions to the Red Cross \nalthough, as has been stated, not a single colored nurse was sent to minister \nto the sick and dying colored soldier boys in France. Every black soldier \nboy who passed into the Great Beyond across the sea looked up into the \nface of a white nurse, as he whispered his last, dying message to his loved \nones at home. The colored soldiers who lay wounded and weak in France knew \nfull well that there were many trained nurses in their own race who \nwould have given a great deal for the privilege of nursing them back to \nhealth. But they knew also that colored nurses were banned from their bed\nbedside by a cruel, unreasonable race-prejudice which neither the exigencies \nnor the horrors of War could rout or make afraid. When I think of the \ntragedy of such a situation I try to comfort myself by hoping that the colored \nsoldiers who died in France \n\n\n\n16\nand soothed by the hope that the blood they had shed in their country's \ndefense would help to wash the huge barriers erected by a cruel race \nprejudice to handicap and hinder their race. \n           Of the 400,000 colored soldiers who went to France to fight and make the \nworld safe for Democracy practically all have returned. Try as hard as they \nmay, they can not discover that the conditions confronting their race have \nbeen improved. Since they have returned they have seen their race victims of \nmob violence in various parts of the country including the capital of the \nUnited States, although in not a single instance were colored people themselves \nthe cause of the riot, their enemies and traducers to the contrary \nnotwithstanding. There is no doubt whatever that the race riot in Washington \nD.C. was started by white soldiers and sailors from the South who could\ncould not bear to see colored men wearing the uniform of soldiers and who \nhad threatened more than once to do something to \"show the niggers they \nmust stay in their place.\" \n           \"Was it is for this treatment our race is receiving, the colored soldiers \nare asking, \"that we fought those battles in France? Was it for this cruel \ndenial of our rights, for this continual wounding of our sensibilities, \nthis ruthless crushing of our hopes, this deliberate attempt to destroy \nthe manhood and the womanhood of the race that many of us lay on beds of \nsuffering and pain, others have returned home crippled and maimed and some \nhave sacrificed their lives?\"\n          Neither colored soldiers nor their friends are asking that they be given \nlucrative positions or be paid in dollars and cents for the superhuman \neffort many of them put forth in the defense of the Allies. But they are \nasking that the leaders of this country tell them the plain, unvarnished \ntruth about Democracy as it is going to apply to them. The colored people \nof this country now believe that when this country proclaimed to the world \nthat it was \"fighting to make the world safe for Democracy,\" they were \ntricked into believing in a cause which was merely \"a scrap of paper,\" \nand did not exist at all.

The extra work on my book knocked me out completely, my eyes were in such a bad condition that it is almost impossible for me to read the daily newspapers. Added to that I have a severe case of diabetes and high blood pressure. I expect to undergo the pressure of a very strict diet from now on. I hope this, in course of time may build me up again and place me in normal condition, for the above reason, I could not run over to Washington to witness Phyllis's commencement recital. \n     In fast I have been in such a depressed state of mind I was compelled to have my old pal Mr. Burke to type this letter. \n     Of course you saw VanCourt's last monthly statement. I counted in his list ten vacant houses one dispossess and a vacant lot which failed to respond. I wrote him at length asking him whether the cause was due to his being absent on vacation, or failure to keep the houses in proper repair. I think this condition of affairs requires our immediate attention. Formerly we always received a check for from nine hundred to one thousand dollars. Now each month it seems to be slipping. If you remember, under Jim Wrights handling those houses went over a thousand dollars all of which he accomplished in a short space of time, but of course we did right to substitute Van Court when we found that Wright was neglecting them. \n     I also asked Van Court if he saw any desirable spot where we would erect new buildings either on vacant property or in place of some of the old houses to double our income. I am of the opinion, if necessary, we could borrow sufficient money to do what building is necessary and carry a slight mortgage. There is one thing certain, we must not allow these houses to fall below the danger zone. If they continue to deteriorate and no exertion of effort on our part is made to hold them steady by keeping them in an attractive or rentable condition we are liable to become seriously embarrassed in keeping our heads above water. Let me know what you think of this and what I should do with my book for the present, which is almost complete. I am sure a good long vacation and rest along with a chance of climate some where in the country would do me a lot of good. \n     Give my love to Phylis and tell her I will write her later. \nDevotedly\nBrother\nTom\n_____________________________________________________\nCampbell C.

Assisting me in my home at that time was a young woman from South Carolina whom I\nhad sent through the High School and who was about to complete her course\nin the Normal School. She was absolutely dependable in every way and quite\na good cook. I explained to her that I was especially anxious to have every\nthing pass off well, while Mrs. Bethune was my guest, because she had treated\nme so handsomely while I was with her in Florida. My dearly-beloved \n[??ula?] promised me that she would do her level best. I bought a chicken frm\nfrom a dealer who assured me that it was as tender as a broiler. It did not\nexactly look the part and I had my doubts, but the man assured me that it\nwas all right. However, I wrote a note for Eula, just before I left home to\nattend a meeting, in which I advised her to parboil the chicken, if she had\nthe slightest suspicion that it was not tender enough to roast as it was.\nI also suggested that she should get some ice cream for dessert, so that\nshe would not be bothered with making it herself.\n\nWhen Mrs. Bethune and I sat down to dinner, the chicken was so tough we\ncould hardly eat any part of it. Eula had not parboiled it, as I had advised\nher to do. Naturally I expected to have ice cream for dessert, but instead\nof the ice cream Eula brought us something, the like of which I had\nnever seen before and have never beheld since. She had decided to make a tapioca pudding in which she\nwas an expert, because she added some demi-semi-quayer to it, which made it\nparticularly good. But the concoction which she set before us looked like\na piece of brown parchment and it tasted like it too. We could not eat that\neither. Eula explained this sad failure to me by saying that she had tried to make\nthe pudding particularly good and had injected into it more of something\nthan she usually did and had ruined it completely.\n\nWhen I first went to housekeeping I enjoyed it. I studied all the\nnew notions, attended Mrs. Rorer's lectures on cooking and made a business of\nkeeping up with the times. But, when I began my public work I realized that I was seriously handicapped because \nI had to teach myself to cook and had never been in the kitchen with a\nwoman who was efficient and willing to show me just how many things were done\nI followed the cook book slavishly and did not dare to add or subtract\n\n[*5*]\n\nanything from a recipe, as some of my friends who had enjoyed such training\nwither in their own home or in somebody else's kitchen were able to do.\n\nI balked at nothing which had to be done in the home. With the little assistance\nwhich I received occasionally from the children and my helper I gave each of\nfour rooms originally finished in oak four coats of ivory paint. When anything\nneeded a coat varnish, or the floors had to be stained, I did that.\n\nThe parlor furniture which we bought when we went to housekeeping began\nfinally to look worn and needed repairing.

Try to persuade your daughter to use\nher head he said and let others whose brains have not been trained use their hands.\n\nMother was very much impressed with Mr. Douglass's advice, for she had\noften expressed an opinion similar to his herself.

Her eyes blazed with anger. \n\"What you have said about our men is false.

We cannot hope to settle that. \nI have never professed to love the race, you know. I love you.\" \nHe drew nearer to her. \"Will you send me away from you, Carmille, an \nunhappy, broken man? Because of a mistaken idea of duty and honor, will \nyou doom yourself to misery all the days of your life? Trust your life \nto me. You will never regret the sacrifice you make. I swear I will make \nyou happy. I will be true to you. The customs and prejudices of a \ncountry_the arbitrary laws of man-why should they stand between me \nand the woman I love?\"\nShe arose quickly. There was something about her that reminds one of a \nhunted animal, whose captors have him at bay. Without replying she attempted \nto run away. For a minute the man stood dazed. She had gone but \na few steps, before he overtook her. \"I shall save you from yourself\", he \nmuttered. He took her face in his hands and drank in her beauty ravenously, \nthe peach bloom of her cheeks, the small straight nose, the full \nred lips, the kissable mouth. And her eyes-how glorious they were always, \nbut never more appealing then, now that they were moist with tears.\n\n\"See how I love you, Carmille,\" he said passionately..\"Will you condemn me to \ndeath?\" He threw his arms about her and their lips met in one long kiss. \nArthur Foster was drunk with happiness that night.

The law of the\nMedes and Persians was not more\nchangeless and certain than this.\nTherefore, those who really have the\nSouth's interests at heart should not\ncease to labor and remonstrate with\nit, until it is turned from its evil way.\nNo greater service could be rendered\nthe SOUTH BY ITS BEST FRIENDS\nTHAN TO EMANCIPATE THE \nPEOPLE OF THAT SECTION FROM THE\nTHRALLDOM OF THEIR NARROW,\nMEAN AND PETTY PREJUDICES,\nrelease them from the slavery of the\nbrain-blighting, soul-crushing intolerance\nof other people's views, teach \nthem the difference between the highest,\npurest patriotism and a narrow-sectional\npride, instill a sense of justice\nwhich will prevent them from \neither inflicting or withholding the\npenalty for wrong-doing and crime on\naccount of the color of a man's skin,\nfinally breathe in the hearts of \npeople as a whole a broad, Christian\ncharity which shall extend even to\ntheir former slaves.\n\nAt the Confederate Veterans' reunion\nwhich was held in New York\ncity a short time ago, F. Hopkinson\nSmith, who a few years ago, while lecturing\nin Boston, won great fame and\nrenown by attacking the veracity and\nimpugning the motives of the sainted\nHarriet Beecher Stowe, declared that\n\"conferring the ballot upon the Negro\nwas the greatest crime of the century.\"\nIt is not surprising that brilliant, intellectual\nlights like Mr. Smith and\nothers of his ilk, should entertain such \na view. FOR THE BALLOT IS THE\nONLY THING UNDER HEAVEN\nAND ON TOP OF THIS MUNDANE\nSPHERE THAT WILL ENABLE THE\nCOLORED AMERICAN TO PROTECT\nHIMSELF.  (Great applause.)  After\nexpressing his disapprobation of the \nColored brother's citizenship, Mr.\nSmith proceeded to arraign and indict\nthe Colored man for just those crimes,\nalleged to have been committed since\nthe war which would poison men's\nminds against the freedmen most.  But\nthe CROWNING INFAMY OF THIS\nVENOMOUS ATTACK UPON A \nRACE, whose fathers and mothers for\nnearly 300 years Mr. Smith's ancestors\ndehumanized and debauched was when\nhe referred to the immorality of Colored\nmen and DECLARED THAT\nWHITE MEN IN THE SOUTH NO\nLONGER DARE TO LEAVE THEIR\nWIVES AND DAUGHTERS ALONE.\nIf this be true, surely it is not because\nof crimes against the womanhood of\nthe dominant race which Colored men\ncommit.  Statistics compiled by white\nmen themselves and available to all\nshow that out of every hundred Colored\nmen who are lynched from 75 to\n85 are not even accused by the South\nof what is so maliciously and falsely\ncalled the usual crime.  When one\nclass of American citizens is so mali-\n(?) by another, is it\n\nTHEIR OPPRESSED BROTHERS IN\nTHE SOUTH ARE ROBBED OF\nEVERY RIGHT THAT MEN HOLD\nDEAR, if it does nothing but prove\nthat there are Colored people in this\ncountry who, WITHOUT ANY QUALIFICATION\nOR RESERVATION\nWHATSOEVER INSIST UPON ALL\nTHOSE RIGHTS, PRIVILEGES AND \nIMMUNITIES OF CITIZENSHIP\nWHICH OTHER AMERICANS ENJOY,\nthis meeting will not have been\ncalled in vain.  If meetings like this\ncould be held in every city and town in\nthe North, I verily believe that the\nslumbering conscience and the patriotic\npride of the nation would shortly\nbe so aroused that the LAWLESSNESS\nWHICH REDUCES MORE\nTHAN A MILLION AMERICAN\nCITIZENS TO THE LEVEL OF\nSERFS AND SLAVES WOULD SOON\nBE A THING OF THE PAST.

God grant \nthat our own beloved land may not be \nforced to atone a second time for\ncruel oppression of a persecuted race\nin a nation's blood and tears.\n\nNorth Should Save South From Its\nOwn Folly.\nIt is plainly the NORTH'S DUTY\nTO SAVE THE SOUTH FROM ITSELF.\nOccasionally we hear about\nthe cruel yoke of oppression under\nwhich Colored people groan in the\nSouth today. And every word written \nor spoken on this subect is the\ntruth since it would be impossible to\nexaggerate the facts. But let me assure\nyou that the COLORED MAN IS\nNOT THE ONLY SLAVE IN THE\nSOUTH TODAY. I verily believe\nthere are hundreds of white men in\nthe Southern States who have been\nblessed with splendid intellects, who\nare kind and tender of heart, and who\nyearn to be true to their higher, better\nnatures, but who dare not listen to\nthe dictates of conscience and be just,\nbecause they languish in the chains\nwhich a tyrannical public opinion and\ncruel, revengeful, vindictive intolerance\nof other people's views have \nforged.\nIf I believed that the South of today\nwere a Sodom and Gemorrah in\n\n(Continued on page 5)\n\n\n[?] [?] [?] THE PEOPLE\nOF THAT SECTION FROM THE \nTHRALLDOM OF THEIR NARROW,\nMEAN AND PETTY PREJUDICES,\nrelease them from the slavery of the\nbrain-blighting, soul-crushing intolerance\nof other people's views, teach \nthem the difference between the highest,\npurest patriotism and a narrow-sectional\npride, instill a sense of justice\nwhich will prevent them from\neither inflicting or withholding the\npenalty for wrong-doing  and crime on\naccount of the color of a man's skin,\nfinally breathe in the hearts of the \npeople as a whole a broad, Christian\ncharity which shall extend even to\ntheir former slaves.\n\nAt the Confederate Veterans' reunion\nwhich was held in New York\ncity a short time ago, F. Hopkinson\nSmith, who a few years ago, while lecturing\nin Boston, won great fame and\nrenown by attacking the veracity and\nimpugning the motives of the sainted\nHarriet Beecher Stowe, declared that\n\"conferring the ballot upon the Negro\nwas the greatest crime of the century.\"\nIt is not surprising that brilliant, intellectual\nlights like Mr. Smith and \nothers of his ilk, should entertain such\na view. FOR THE BALLOT IS THE\nONLY THING UNDER HEAVEN\nAND ON TOP OF THIS MUNDANE\nSPHERE THAT WILL ENABLE THE\nCOLORED AMERICAN TO PROTECT\nHIMSELF. (Great applause.) After\nexpressing his disapprobation of the\nColored brother's citizenship, Mr.\nSmith proceeded to to arraign and indict\nthe Colored man for just those crimes,\nalleged to have been committed since\nthe war which would poison men's \nminds against the freedmen most. But\nthe CROWNING INFAMY OF THIS\nVENOMOUS ATTACK UPON A\nRACE, whose fathers and mothers for\nnearly 300 years Mr. Smith's ancestors\ndehumanized and debauched was when\nhe referred to the immorality of Colored\nmen and DECLARED THAT\nWHITE MEN IN THE SOUTH NO\nLONGER DARE TO LEAVE THEIR\nWIVES AND DAUGHTERS ALONE.\nIf this be true, surely it is not because\nof crimes against the womanhood of\nthe dominant race which Colored men\ncommit. Statistics compiled by white\nmen themselves and available to all\nshow that out of every hundred Colored\nmen who are lynched from 75 to\n85 are not even accused by the South\nof what is so maliciously and falsely\ncalled the usual crime. When one\nclass of American citizens is so mali-\n[?] by another, is it\n\n[?], justice and equality before the\nlaw of every human being for which\nthis Republic professes to stand; in \nshort, TREASON TO THE VERY\nPRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THIS \nGOVERNMENT WAS BUILT!

Father threatened to sue the railroad company, because the conductor had tried to eject me from a first class coach, although he himself held a first class ticket and had purchased a first-class half ticket for me Since there was no statute in the State compelling colored people to ride in a separate coach, as there is to day, a good case against the railroad company ight easly have been made.\n\nWhen my little daughters were about ten and twelve years old, I was invited to be one of five judges for an art exhibit made by colored people in an exposition in a neighboring State. In going from the town in which the exposition was held to a hear-by city we boarded an electric car. The conductor did not oberve that the girls were with me, so he directed them to a se seat near the front. The two back seats on each side of the aisel were reserved for colored people, and knowing the law all too well, I took one off them. One of my chiilcren turned around to see where i was and beckoned to me to come up to the front and take the seat behind them. My girls had envr been\n\n\" Are those your children\"? the conductor inquired. \"Why do you ask?\" I replied. \"You'll see,\" he said. Whereupon he went forward and rudely ordered my two daughters to go back to one of the rear seats where they belonged. My little girls did not understand what it was all about. They knew nothing about the Jim Crow laws. They did not know that colored people were obliged to sit in certain seats or in separate cars anywhere in the United States. In their tender youth I tried to keep them in ignorance of the indignities to which colored people are subjected on account of their race. I agruged that s they grew to womanhood, they would learn about them soon enough. Although, as a colored woman, I have passed through many harrowing experiences which I should like to forget, I can recall nothing which pained me more than when I hear my little girls ordered out of the front seats, saw them forced to walk down the aisle with the passengers gasing at them in their confusion and take seats in the Jim Crow section of the car. \n\nThe most serious thing which confronts me as a colored woman is my\n\n5\n\ninability to secure employment in the pursuits for which I am fitted by nature and training. It would be practically impossible for me to secure a position in a newspaper office, for example, in any city of this country to do the kind of work which a woman belonging to any race except the one with which I am identified would, under similar circumstances, be allowed to do. I am acquainted with one colored woman who was employed by a large daily [manyyearsago] years ago, when the prejudice against colored people in the North was not so pronnounced as it is to day. She was given a chance by a broadminded man who was willing to see what a colored woman could do. She has succeeded admirably in her work and enjoys the respect and confidence of both her employers and her associates. In spite of the splended record which this colored woman has made, it is doubtful whehter one of her race could secure a similar position [tondahat] same paper to day. I am also acquainted with anouther colored woman who by a fortunate concatenation of circumstances secured employment in the fashion department of a large magazine in the East But these outstanding cases are simply the exceptions which prove the rule. It is about as easy for a colored woman to secure such a position as either of these as it is to catch greased lightning in a bottle.\n\nIn spite of my college education I might walk up and down the street of almost any city or town in this country without being able to get employment either as a typist or stenographer with a white firm. My degrees of A.M. and A.B. would avail me nothing at all. Here and there it is possible to find isolated cases in which[?], fortuitious and fortunate circumstances habe made it possible for a well-educated colored woman to secure a position as typist or stenographer with a white firm, but these are about as rare ars the proverbial hen's teeth. Colored women get such jobs about as often as one picks up a fortune on the street or discovers a gold mine on his city lot\n\nIt occurred to me while I was still in collete that it would be a fne thing to earn some money.

With what a fine  outburst of \nenthusiasm he recounts the reasons for his \npride in his race whose, \n\"Name is write on Glory's scroll, \nIn characters of fire.\"\n\nWhat a magnificent tribute he has paid \nhis people for the long suffering, uncomplaining \nmatter in which they bore the \ntrials and tribulations heaped upon them \nduring slavery and the Christ-like manner\n in which after emancipation they forgave \nthose who had despitefully used them, in \nthe following lines:\n\n\"No other race, or white or black,\nWhen bound as thou wert to the rack,\nSo seldom stooped to grieving.\nNo other race, when free again,\nForgot the past and proved them men\nSo noble in forgiving.\"\n\nAgain when Frederick Douglas dies: \n\"and Ethiopia with bosom torn, \nLaments the passing of her noblest son,\n\nPaul Dunbar, inspired by the reverence and affections \nfor his illustrious benefactor and \nfriend pays him one of the rarest and finest \ntributes ever offered by poet to mortal man. \n\n\"Oh Douglas, thou hast passed beyond the shore, \nBut still thy voice is ringing o'er the gale. \nThou's taught thy race how high her hopes may soar,\nAnd bade her seek the heights, nor faint, nor fail\nShe will not fail, she heeds thy stirring cry,\nShe knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh,\nAnd rising from beneath the chastening rod, \nShe stretches our her bleeding hand to God.\" \n\nIt is difficult to speak of his ode to \"The \nColored Soldiers\" in terms of quiet moderation \nand use language which may not \nsmack of exaggeration to some. How \nPaul Dunbar glories in their dauntless \ncourage and delights to recount the great\n service they rendered their country during the Civil War: \n\n\"so when war in savage triumph,  \n\nSpread abroad his funeral pall-\nThen you called the colored soldiers,\nAnd they answered to your call.\n\nAnd like hounds unleashed and eager\nFor the life blood of the prey,\nSprung they forth and bore them bravely\nIn the thickest of the fray. \n\nAnd where'er the fight was hottest- \nWhere the bullets fastest fell\nThere they pressed unblanched and fearless \nAt the very mouth of hell.\"\n\nHe takes a pardonably fierce delight in \nreminding this country that his race is not \nindebted entirely to others for its emancipation \nfrom the awful bondage it endured. \n\n\"Yes, the blacks enjoy their freedom,\nAnd they won it dearly too;\nFor the life blood of their thousands\nDid the southern fields bedew:\n\nIn the darkness of their bondage,\nIn their depths of slavery's night:\nTheir muskets flashed the dawning \nAnd they fought their way to light.\n\nThey were comrades then and brothers,\nAre they more or less to-day?\nThey were good to stop a bullet,\nAnd to front the fearful fray.\n\nThey were citizens and soldiers, \nWhen rebellion raised its head; \nAnd the traits that made them worthy---\nAh! these virtues are not dead.\n\nAnd their deeds shall find a record,\nIn the registry of Fame;\nFor their blood has cleansed completely \nEvery blot of slavery's shame.\n\nSo all honor and all the glory\nTo those noble sons of Ham---\nTo those gallant colored soldiers,\nWho fought for Uncle Sam.\"\n\nSo long as there is remains in this country \na man even remotely connected with the \nrace, whose soldiers have been so immortalized \nby the eloquence and the music of \nthe verses just quoted, and so long as the \nblood courses warm in the heart of such a\n man, so long will it thrill under this heroic \node, one of the best that was ever written \nand which can be compared only with \n\nPAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR 275\n\nBurn's \"Scots, who hae wi' Wallace bled.\"\n\nIt can be asserted without fear of successful \ncontradiction that in range of genius \nas well as power and aptness of expression\n Mr. Dunbar has not been excelled \nby any poet born in United States. If\nhe infrequently rose into the region of \ngreat ideas, the peculiar conditions surrounding \nhim and not his mental limitations \nare responsible for this failure to soar\n aloft. To some of his more serious poems \nreference has already been made. In the\n same class his \"Life\", \"Comparison\", \"A \nCreed and Not a Creed,\" together with \nothers equally as good are as elevated in \nsentiment, as profound in philosophy, as \nmusical in tone, as perfect in form and as \ncomplete in treatment as some of the best \npoems written by the most inspired singers \nof the past.\n\nAttention has already been directed to \nthe attitude of the editors who published \nMr. Dunbar's poems and who insisted upon \nhis confining himself to dialect. So far \nas I know, with but a single exception, \nthis advice was given him by all his literary \nadvisers and friends. \n\nIn two little stanzas entitled, \"The Poet\", \nwhich Mr. Dunbar wrote to explain his \nposition with reference to more serious \nefforts which he wished to make but from \nwhich he was withheld by the public one \ncannot help feeling bitter regret which \ndisturbed his peace of mind and the resentment \nwhich rankled his heart. \n\nTHE POET. \nHe sang of life serenely sweet,\nWith now and then a deeper note,\nOn some high peak, nigh yet remote,\nHe voiced the world's absorbing beat.\n\nHe sang of love, when earth was young,\nAnd love itself was in his lays, \nBut ah! the world, it turned to praise, \nA jingle in a broken tongue.\n\n\nIt is always pleasant for me to recall \nthat the first time I ever heard of Paul \n\nDunbar was when the illustrious Frederick \nDouglas told me about him, while we \nwere in his library at Cedar Hill on afternoon \nand read me one of the young poet's \nearly productions entitled Drowsy Day. \nPrevious to the reading, however, Mr.\nDouglas had spoken with deep feeling \nabout the young man's poverty and had \nexpresses regret that he had been so seriously \nhandicapped in his career.  And so \nas he afterward read the poem, the great \nman was so deeply affected by it, that \nhe could not restrain his tears. When Mr. \nDunbar first took up his residence in Washington, \nhe lived in a house at 1934 4th \nstreet N.W., next door to the one in \nwhich we were living at that time. Near \nneighbors as we were, it was quite natural \nthat we should see a great deal of each \nother and we did. Being a hero worshiper \nby nature and inclination as well as \nby cultivation, particularly where members \nof my own race are concerned, I did not \ntry to conceal from Mr. Dunbar home great \nand genuine was my admiration of his gifts \nand how brilliant were the hopes I entertained \nof his future success. It happened \ntherefore, that many a time he honored me \nby coming to my home to read me his poems \nor his short stories, telling me in \nwhat magazine they had appeared or would\n appear. He would also tell me how much \nhe had received for his articles, when I was \nimpertinent enough to inquire,  which I \nfrequently did, just for the pleasure of \nhearing how well he was compensated for \nthe product of his genius and his brain. \nOn one occasion he invited me to his home, \nso that he might read a play which he had \njust written and which I hope may someday \nbe produced.  \n\nMr.Dunbar was a man of charming personality \nwith a bold, warm, buoyant humor \nof character which manifested itself \ndelightfully to his friends.

While there was nothing intrusive\nor forward about Paul Dunbar,\nwhen he found himself among eminent\nscholars or distinguished people in the\nhighest social circles, he showed both by\nhis manner and his conversation that he\nfelt he was just exactly where he was entitled\nto be.  There was nothing that smacked\nof truckling, and nobody in the wildest\nflight of his imagination could dream that\nPaul Dunbar felt particularly flattered at\nthe attention he received.  The maturity\nof intellectual power was manifested in his\nconversation as well as in his writing and\nhis fund of information was remarkable,\nconsidering both his youth and his meagre\nopportunities for culture.\nHis wit was decidedly pungent at times\nand then nobody in his presence was immune\ntherefrom.  His sense of the ludicrous\nwas highly developed and nothing\nridiculous or funny escaped him.  I can\nnever hear certain styles of music rendered\nwithout being convulsed, when I remember\nthe comments made by Dunbar at a musical\nwe attended once.\nLast July Mr. Dunbar extended me a \ncordial invitation to be the guest of himself\nand his mother, while I was attending\nthe convention of the Ohio Federation of\nColored Women's clubs which was held \nat Dayton, Ohio, and which I had been\nasked to address.  I accepted and spent several\ndays at his home.  I am glad I did,\nfor I am sure I learned more about the\ncharacter of the man and the genius of the\npoet during the short visit with him in\nDayton than it would have been possible\nfor me to ascertain in any other way.  I \naccount it a privilege to have had such an\nexcellent opportunity of becoming thoroughly\nacquainted with the greatest poet\nthe race has ever produced.  During the\nfew days spent with Mr. Dunbar last sum-\n\nmer I discovered there were depths in his\ncharacter that I had never sounded and\nqualities of heart of which I had never\ndreamed, although I saw him frequently\nwhile he lived in Washington.\nOwen Meredith says that\n\nThe heart of a man is like that delicate weed\nWhich requires to be trampled on, boldly indeed\nEre it gives forth the fragrance you wish to extract.\nTis a simile, trust me, if not new, exact.\n\nWhether affliction and sorrow always\nbring out the best there is in a man, I cannot\nsay.  I do know however, that the\nphysical and mental pain which Paul Dunbar\nendured for at least a year before he\npassed away, developed the highest and noblest\nqualities in him.  When I saw Paul\nDunbar last summer, he was shut in, wasted\nand worn by disease, coughing his young\nand precious life away, yet full of cheer,\nwhen not actually racked with pain, and\nperfectly resigned to his fate.  I shall always\nthink of his patience under his severe\naffliction as a veritable miracle of modern\ntimes.  In the flush of early manhood\nfull of promise of still greater literary\nachievement in the future than he had been\nable to attain in the past, fond of life as\nthe young should be and usually are, there\nhe sat, rapidly losing his physical strength\nevery hour, and yet, miracle or miracles,\nno bitter complaint of his cruel fate did I\nhear escape his lips a single time.  The\nweakness and inertia of his worn and wasted\nbody contrasted sadly and strangely\nwith the strength and activity of his vigorous\nmind.  As I looked at him, pity for\nthe afflicted man himself and pity for the\nrace to which he belonged and which I\nknew would soon sustain such an irreparable\nloss in his death almost overcame me\nmore than once.  As incredible as it may\nappear, his moods were often sunny and\nthen it was delightful to hear the flood of\nmerriment roll cheerily from his lips. \n\nPAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR     277\n\nIt was gratifying to see the homage paid\nMr. Dunbar by some of the most cultured\nand some of the wealthiest people of the\ndominant race in Dayton.  As soon as I\nreached his house, I saw a chair most elaborately\ndecorated in royal purple and was \ninformed that a company of distinguished\npeople of the dominant race had improvised\na birth day party for the young poet a few \ndays before I arrived and had thus festooned\nthis chair in his honor.  One of Mr.\nDunbar's white friends did all his stenography\nfor him for nothing, refusing to \ntake a cent of pay.  What an invaluable\nservice was thus rendered is easily seen\nand appreciated, when it is known that Mr.\nDunbar's last two volumes of poems, Lyrics\nof Sunshine and Shadow, and Howdy,\nHoney, Howdy, were prepared for publication\nby this same generous and unselfish\nfriend.  Mr. Dunbar's mother told me that\nthe white people of Dayton had helped her\ncare for her son in every conceivable way.\nOne one ocasion after some beautiful\ngirls had called to pay their respects to Mr.\nDunbar had gone, in a nervous effort to relieve\nthe tension of my own feelings, I\nturned to him and said,  \"Sometimes I am\ntempted to believe you are not half so ill\nas you pretend to be.  I believe you are\njust playing the roll of interesting invalid,\nso as to receive the sympathy and the homage\nof these beautiful girls.\"  \"Sometimes\nI think I am just loafing myself,\"\nhe laughingly replied.

Personally I believe he will occupy \nas high a place in American literature\nas Burns does in the British, if not higher.\nBut whether Paul Dunbar will be rated\ngreat or not, it is certain that he had rendered\nan invaluable service to his race.\nBecause he has lived and wrought, the\nrace to which he belonged has been lifted\nto a higher plane.  Each and every person\nin the United States remotely identified\nwith his race is heal in higher esteem because\nof the ability which Paul Dunbar\npossessed and the success he undoubtedly\nattained.\nIndeed the whole civilized world has \ngreater respect for that race which some\nhave the ignorance to underestimate and\nothers the hardihood to despise, because\nthis black man, through whose veins not a \ndrop of Caucasian blood was known to\nflow, has given such a splendid and striking\nproof of its capacity for high intellectual\nachievement.\nThe more one thinks of the obstacles\nPaul Dunbar was obliged to surmount, the\nmore remarkable appear both the quality\nand quantity of the literary labor which\nhe performed.  Other poets have been\nborn poor before and were cruelly handicapped\nfor years by hard and grinding toil.\nIn the history of men who have enlightened\nthe world through the medium of\ntheir pens or lightened its sorrows by their\nwit and mirth, poverty is no new thing.\nMilton was poor and so was Burns, between\nwhom and Paul Dunbar there is a \nstriking similarity in several respects.

Earnest efforts should be made to induce those who employ \nyoung women to make their burdens as light as possible and to care for them \nin the best possible way. \nA well-known newspaper man declared a few days ago that the most significant \nthing in the world today is the increasing self-consciousness \nof the American Negro since the World War.

She was Mrs. Emmeline Pankhurst, the first militant \nsuffragist, one of the most remarkable women England has ever produced. \nThe injustice perpetrated upon women put the iron into her soul and she decided \nthat she would do everything in her power to right the wrongs from \nwhich they suffered. Accordingly, with her daughter Christabel she founded \nthe Women's Social and Political Union and started the Votes form Women agitation. \nShe headed a deputation to the House Commons to demand the vote only \nto be thrown into jail with others who had joined her. Nothing daunted \nshe would resume her crusade more vigorously than ever as soon as she was released \nfrom jail. It was a common sight to behold Mrs. Pankhurst being yanked \nto the Holloway jail by a big, burly Bobby. She and others who had joined \nthe fight for suffrage resorted to the most desperate methods imaginable. \nThey broke the windows in the residences of officials, stoned the gentlemen \nthemselves and got themselves disliked by the august authorities on general \nprinciples. When I was in London a few years ago one of the leaders of the \nmovement discussed the method of procedure very frankly. \n\"I presume,\" she said \"that you American women think we are very unladylike \nover here. Well, maybe we are. But after we discovered that being ladylike \nwas not getting us anywhere, we decided to pursue an entirely different \ncourse, we came to the conclusion that it was better to be unladylike and \nget our rights than to be ladylike and never have them. Moreover, you American \nwomen don't have to carry on as we do the you want something. American men \nwill at least listen to you.

JENKINS, Vice-President Hertel, Jenkins & Co.\n\nFORD'S HAIR POMADE was formerly known as \"OZONIZED OX MARROW,\" and is the only saf\npreparation known to us that makes kinky or curly hair straight.  Its use makes the most stubborn\nharsh, kinky or curly hair soft, pliable and easy to comb.  These results may be obtained from one treatment;\n2 to 4 bottles are usually sufficient for a year.

FORD'S HAIR\nPOMADE (\"OZONIZED OX MARROW\") has been made and sold continuously since about 1858, and the\nlabel, \"OZONIZED OX MARROW,\" was registered in the United States Patent Office in 1874.  In all that\nlong period of time there has never been a bottle returned from the hundreds of thousands we have sold.\nFORD'S HAIR POMADE remains sweet and effective, no matter how long you keep it.

Of late he\nhas exhibited nothing of that calm, judicial,\nunruffled temper that we are wont to\nsee in our presidents.  Frantic with fury\nat an independent judiciary, overtowering\ntin his ambition to be the most popular president\nAmerica has ever had, arrogant and\nbulldozing towards Congress, which makes\nthe laws which he is to execute, impatient\nwith those who do not hasten to accept his\nradical and socialistic preachments, the\nconservative citizenry of the country are\nbeginning to feel a dizziness as if we were\nrushing down a steep place to destruction.\n\nThe proper Critic\nWhile it is the duty of each\none of the departments of\nthe government to respect\nthe other in its sphere of operations, on the\nother hand it is the duty of the people to\nwatch their liberties with the eye of an\neagle and to forcibly and fearlessly criticise\nany and all of the departments when they\ndo not perform their respective duties.\nFor instance, Mr. Roosevelt has mad himself\nliable to criticism by the way he has\navoided calling the attention of Congress\nto the open nullification of the 14th and\n15th Amendments to the Constitution in\nthe Southern section of the United States.\nHad the violation of this fundamental law\nof the land related to anything else save\nthe Negro, our strenuous President would\nnot only have called the attention of Congress\nto the matter, but would have had\nthe Attorney General and all his department\non the trail of the lawbreakers.  To\nthus allow the laws of the land to be openly\nviolated without turning so much as a \nstraw to correct this evil tendency is a \ngross breach of duty as an impartial executive\nof all the people.  The President\nowes it, not only to eight million colored\ncitizens, but to all of those people who believe\nin law as the mainstay of society, to,\n\nat least, seek to limit the field of activities\nof class legislators.  Quite likely his \ncourse has been based on a mistaken\npolicy of peace and reconcilliation; but a \npeace which acquiesces in the decitenization\nof a large class of people is a cowardly\npeace which no official should welcome.\nCongress, too, has been derelict to its duty.\nIt seems to have formed itself into a conspiracy\nto gabble.  All of the problems of\nthe country go begging for solution while the \nrepresentatives of the people at Washington\nindustrially manufacture campaign thunder.\nNever have we suffered from a greater\ndearth of statesmanship.  Law-breaking is\nso common in America these days and the\ninterests of civilization are so seldom vindicated\nthat it is becoming manifest to all\nthe world that whatever else the United\nStates government can do, one thing it cannot\ndo, and this is to govern its own people.\nOur courts rest under a deep shadow\nof suspicion.  It is a remarkable fact that\nthe Supreme Court of the land has always\nfound a way to evade a square decision on\nour vicious Southern disfranchisement\nlaws.  The grandfather clauses in all of\nthese new Southern State Constitutions\nare manifestly opprobrious and one-sided\narrangements.  They would be aburd and\nunsupportable in any fair court in the land.\nThe lawyers who have appeared before the\ncourts in the interest of these bad laws\nhave gone there with no law and no argument,\n-nothing but the mere vapidity of\nidle words.  And yet the courts have\nwrapped themselves about in a cloud of\nlegal verbiage and allowed the rascality of\nundermining the Constitution to go on unchecked.\nThe Chattanooga lynching was\nan open flouting of the dignity of the Supreme\nCourt and a challenge to the potential\nefficiency of the Federal Government.\nWhat has the Court done to uphold its dignity.\nWhat has the President done to protect\nthe Court?  What expression have we \n\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW     395\n\nheard in Congress against this denuded\ndiabolism?  Manifestly, the whole regime\nis squandering the political heritage of the\npeople.  But something will yet happen\nto stir up the stagnated morals of the Nation.\nIt is up to those people who believe\nin law, liberty and justice to stand by their\nguns.\n\nThe Shattering of\na Glass House\nSenator Hopkins of\nIllinois performed a \nduty in the Senate on\nthe 19th, of April which should have been\nperformed long ago.  For the last five or\nsix months Senator Tillman of South Carolina\nhas been posing as a great reformer before\nthe country.  Everybody and everything\nhave been of a peculiar wicked character\nto Tillman.  He took a malicious delight\nin finding fault with things.  In his\ntopsy-turvy world the color of the grass\nwas blue, the sky bright green and the\nroses wore an ebony hue.  Tillman was\nforever snapping at and bulldozing everybody.\nUpon this particular occasion he\nwas trying to fasten some blame upon Senators\nHopkins and Cullom for the fact that\nJohn R. Walsh, a Chicago banker who failed\nthrough fraud some months ago, was\nout on bond.  Senator Hopkins turned\nfiercely on Tillman and said:\n\"I am unable to understand the motive that can\nprompt the senator from South Carolina morning\nafter morning, like Don Quixote, to get astride\nhis steed and bring some question into the\nsenate that has no relation to the legislation before\nthis body or before congress for the simple \npurpose of exploiting himself, attracting the attention\nof the galleries and getting a little attention\nthrough the newspapers of the country.  I\ncannot understand why it is that a man living in\nthe section that he does, representing the constituency\nthat we know he represents, should so\nconcern himself as to whether the law in the city\nof Chicago, in the State of Illinois is obeyed.  I\nintimated to him the other day that the 2,000,000 \npeople living within that splendid city are quite\ncapable of taking care of themselves.\n\"Now, I think it is about time that the country\nshould know something about who this modern\nreformer is, this man that is seeking to pillory\nevery other locality as dishonest and every other\nman before the public as a dishonest man and a \nviolator of the law.  I think it is about time that \n\nthe senate and the country should know something\nabout him.  Who is he and where does he\ncome from?  He comes from the State of South\nCarolina, I find, Mr. President, with a white population\nof 557,000 and with a colored population of\n782,000.\n\"It is known the country over that the senator\nowes his seat in this body to the suppression of the\ncolored vote in that State.\n\"It is known here, and it is known there.  I say, in\nevery section of our common country, that the\nmajority of the people of that State, by the manipulation\nof the senator from South Carolina and\nthe men who associate with him in that State,\nhave been deprived of their rights, civil and political,\nthat have been guaranteed to them under\nthe constitution of our common country.\"\nQuoting from one of Senator Tillman's\nlectures in which he declared \"we have\nhung them and burned them in South \nCarolina,\" Senator Hopkins continued:\n\"He bows his head in assent.  My God, think\nof a man in the United States who would approve\nsuch a barbarous and treacherous practice.  He\ntalks about possible infractions of the banking\nlaws; how is a little money to be compared with\nthe burning of men and women at the stake without\nthe opportunity of protecting their innocence?\nWhen the people of South Carolina shall enjoy\nthe rights and privileges granted to them under our\nconstitution, when we may say upon this floor\nthat the courts are open to protect the rights of\nall, great and small, rich and poor, in that State,\nas they are in Illinois, then I will listen with some\npatience to a criticism of me and my people and\nwith the manner in which the law is administered\nin Chicago.  But until that time, Mr. President\nI protest against such a senator as that claiming\nthat the law is not properly and fully administered\nin the city in which I live.\"\nThis provoked a retort from Tillman.  He\ndeclared that the protection of civilization\ndemanded lynching for crimes against womanhood.\nHe made a reference to the recent\nlynching at Springfield, O., which\nbrought Senator Foraker to his feet.  Mr.\nForaker acknowledged regretfully that a \nlynching had occurred at Springfield, but\nrejoiced that Springfield and Ohio contained\nmen who vindicated the law.  He\nsaid that of all the lynchings that had occurred \nin this country, he had never known\nof but one man who defended them in the \n\n", "51", 77, 77, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00233", "398     THE VOICE OF THE NEGRO\n\ner over all legislation.  Still the Russian\npeople have much to expect from this new\ninstitution.  The members of the Duma\nsay the peasants will kill them if they return\nhome without reforms and they declare\nthey will prefer death in the Duma,\nif death it must be.  Nicholas may find\nhis Duma like Louis XV's States-General.\nWhen he orders it prorouged, some fierce\nMirabeau may arise on the floor and tell\nhim that the members of the Duma are\nthere to legislate for the people and will\nonly be dispelled at the point of the bayonet.\nThe day of the meeting of the\nDuma was the most picturesque in the\nhistory of St. Petersburg.  ONe scene in\nparticular was in striking contrast to all\nformer state functions.  Within the inner\nchambers of the Czar's palace,\nmingling with all the gold and glitter\nof the Czar's minarets, was the\nbloused and bearded toiler of the steppes\nand the sear-faces and horny-handed harvester\nof the plains.  It was a sight hard\nto credit, but, nevertheless, a sight which\ntold in dramatic style the tale of a revolution.\nFrom the throne the Czar read a \ncolorless speech which was received in sullen\nsilence by the parliament, altho the \ncourtiers cheered.  The Duma has now\nbegun its work.  Probably its first work\nwill be to ask amnesty for those who were\nimprisoned because they struggled for the\nfreedom of Russia.  One of the burning\nquestions of the Duma will be the defining\nof the relations of the emperor to itself.\nAnother most important task is the peasant\nland question.  That question and the\nquestion of a constitution for the country\nseem to be the great issues for the first\nsession of the body.\n\nThe Voice Publishing\nCompany\nTwo years ago when\n\"The Voice of the \nNegro' was founded\nby Mr. A. N. Jenkins, nobody dreamed \n\nthat within such a short time, it would\nprove to be such a phenomenal success.\nWe are not measuring our success particularly\nby the sordid standard of dollars and\ncents.  We refer to the public sentiment\ncreated in behalf of righteous dealings between\nthe two great races of this country,\nto the discovery of genuine white friends\nfor the Negro, to the acquainting of the\nNegro race with itself, to the ennobling of\nthe lives of our own people and to the inspiriting\nof the masses of both races with\nheart and hope for the dawn of a day when\na broad human sympathy can characterize\nour relations.  In all of these things we\nhave every evidence that we have succeeded.\nSentiment in the South is better towards\nthe Negro because \"The Voice of \nthe Negro\" was established.  ON the\nstreets of Atlanta many of the leading white\ncitizens stop the writer to say that they have\nmore respect for the Negro race since they\nhave had an opportunity to read \"Th\nVoice of the Negro.\"  Our Magazine goes\nto almost all the great libraries of the \nSouth.  There the young people are reading\nit, and are finding out the fact that the\nNegro does not ask charity but justice.\nThey have had the hope shattered that the\nNegro would forever be content to hew\ntheir wood and draw their water.  The\nNegro wants to, and has a right to be a\nfull-fledged citizen of this country.  Thus\nthey at least see that no adjustment can\never be satisfactory that smacks of serfdom.\nWe have proved the fact that, at least in\nthe large cities, free speech will be tolerated\nin the South.  Nobody can accuse us\nof trimming and truckling because our\nMagazine was edited in Georgia.  Before\n\"The Voice of the Negro\" was established\nnobody knew that we had so many excellent\nwriters.  We have not only acquainted\nthe Negro race with itself, but we have\nintroduced many new writers to the white \n\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW     399\n\nworld.  Many a life has been helped by our\nMagazine, and at times we have wished for\na daily or weekly paper so we could publish\nthe many fine letters that come to us.\nWe have succeeded in a measure in welding\nthe darker races of the earth together, for\nin all of the countries of the world, where\nthere are Negroes who speak the English\ntongue, we have enthusiastic admirers.\nFrom Africa, from France, from Australia,\nfrom Jamaica and many other lands\ncome letters saying that \"The Voice of \nthe Negro\" has increased the black people's\nfaith in God and the destiny of the\nrace.  In all of this great work with its\nglorious fruit, Mr. Jenkins, our philanthropic\nfounder, rejoices mightily.  Who\nwould not?  We said we did not measure\nour success in dollars and cents.  We do\nnot?  Many times we have said things that\nour Business Manager thought would cut\noff subscribers and advertisers.  At times\nadvertisers have written us to discontinue\ntheir advertisements because we criticised\ncertain idols of their hearts.  We have faith\nin the right, and so none of these things\nhave moved us; none of them are going to \nmove us.  Soon after Mr. Jenkins founded\n\"The Voice\" it was bought by the Hertel,\nJenkins & Company, publishers of Chicago.\nThe men of the company were all\nwhite.  The managing and editing of the\nmagazine was done by colored men.  But\nthat did not satisfy some critics.  They\nthought Negroes ought to own the Magazine.\nDr. Bowen and Mr. Barber did not\nhave the money to buy the Magazine outright,\nbut they did the next best thing:\nbecame partners with Messrs. Hertel and\nJenkins in the ownership of the Magazine.\nBut his did not satisfy some of our friends.\nBlack people must own the publication outright.\nWe have given these friends a \nchance to make good.  We have formed a\ncorporation known as the Voice Publishing \n\nCompany.  Our authorized capital stock is\n$100,000.  The stock is divided into 10,000\nshares at $10 per share, par value.  A block\nof a thousand shares is now on the market\nat $5 a share.  We have bonded the Magazine\nto the old company for $15,000.  As \nsoon as that is paid by the colored people,\nthe Magazine is theirs.  Do we really want\nto own \"The Voice of the Negro?\"  Now \nis the time to show our faith by our works.\nThen too, this is a business proposition.\nWithin the course of two years we are likely\nto be declaring dividends.  Let us have\nthe support of those friends who love us.\nOnly those who make the effort immediately\nwill be able to secure any of the 1,000\nshares on the market at $5 a share.\n\nMr. Manning's Call\nfor a League\nWe invite our white\nreaders, and particularly\nour Southern\nwhite friends, to peruse carefully the\narticle by Mr. Joseph C. Manning of Alexander\nCity, Ala., published in this issue of\nthe Voice.  Mr. Manning has called for \nthe formation of a league of Southern white\nmen who believe in the principles of free\ngovernment.  He has no desire to assemble\ntogether the hypocrites who prate in\nthe market place about the rights of the\n\"common people\" in one breath and who\nforthwith in the next breath decry so-called\n\"negro domination.\"  Nobody who is\nconsistent with his conscience and the spirit\nof the Declaration of Independence cares to\nhave any association with such pretenders.\nMr. Manning, himself a Southern white \nman, wants to count the hands of those\nSouthern white men who believe in the\nfundamental principles of the American\ngovernment.  The laws of this nation are\nopposed to class legislation.  The honesty\nand individual efficiency of a man is the\ntest of his worthiness to be a citizen.

They are the\nmuck-rakers, those writers of that class\nof fiction which saps the morals, debauches\nthe intellect and corrupts the conduct of\nyouth.  Fully one half of the books of fiction\nthat are now written are mere muck-heaps\nwritten for muck-worms to burrow\nin.  A conspicuously infamous type of\npresent-day toxic literature is the class of\nnovels which Thomas Dixon is giving to\nthe world.  In all of Dixon's books he\nthrows a numbus of heroism around the \nmobbist.  He makes a hero of the highwayman;\nthe midnight marauder and the\nvirile scoundrel are the men he glorifies.\nHe has a way of setting forth his mental\nposing in what appears to be a wonderfully\nluxuriant style, but what is in reality the\ndreariest of inanities.  Bret Harte first exploited\nthe generous rascal as a hero.  Of \nlate years writers feel that if they want to\nget their books on the market, they must\ngive their heroes a dash of blackguardism.\nIn England the ten cent novel which gives\nthe young people the opportunity to enjoy\nthe giddy whirl among the titled throng\nis ruining the lives of the young by giving\nthem false ideas of life.  In America, and\nparticularly in the South, the race question\nis the most fruitful topic for the novelist,\nthe journalist and the politician.  The secret\npoisoners of the Middle Ages were not\nworse than these peddlers of literary muck\non the race question.  The baneful influence\nof this kind of welter can be seen\nevery day.  The little white children are\nhaving mimic lynchings in their own back\nyards, and the youth of seventeen is leading\nthe mob.  Nor do the colored children \nescape the influence of this poisonous\nfiction.  They have seen how Negroes are\ntreated in fiction as sub-human, super-animal\nbeings, and many of them have re-\n\nsolved to die rather than accept the place\nassigned to them.  Witness the harvest of\nmurderers and desperadoes.  It is high\ntime the people of both races were denouncing\nthis class of muck-makers, these\nvenders of literary garbage.  It is time to\nturn the impressionable minds of our young\npeople to that which is excellent and enduring\nin literature.\n\nTHE QUEST FOR TRUTH\n\"Sheen will tarnish, honey cloy, and merry is\nonly a mask of sad.\"-Emerson\nStrikingly and cruelly, but faithfully\nand truly, has this man Emerson pronounced\nthe funeral oration of all the material\nthings of this world  Gold and\nsilver and brass and granite are perishable\neven as are the bodies of mortal man.\nThe truth alone is permanently powerful.\nSearch history and answer:  What \nis it that has withstood the ravages of time\nand linked the ages together?  Surely not\nempires; for all the great empires of the\nworld have risen to vanish like the changes\nof a phantasmagora.  Not the granite and\nbrass monuments that men have reared towards\nthe clouds.  From the far beginnings \nof history men have been rearing\ntheir Babels only to see them crumble\nagain to heaps of rubbish.  Not even the\nmountains with all their majestic attributes\nare steadfast and unmovable.  Any\nday the pent up gases in the earth are likely\nto violently expand and blow off a mountain-top.\nThe one thing that does not have\na fitful and wayward career, the one thing\nimmanent in all the Universe, is Truth.\nThis fact has been recognized by all the\nseers and prophets of the ages past.  Jeremiah,\nthe great Hebrew lamentator, declared\nthat the very atmosphere with which\nthe white-haired Ancient of Days surrounds\nHimself was composed of Truth,and Zachariah\nprophesies the millenial day as the\ntime when Jerusalem shall be called the \n\n\nOUR MONTHLY REVIEW     403\n\nCity of Truths.  And even so all the philosophers\nand seers that have entered the\ntheatre of vital activities for the purpose of\nperceiving relations have come back from\ntheir excursions into the fields of speculation\nwith the conclusion that there is one\ngreat Essence of Things, the First Cause,\nthe I AM.  All else is relative and tributary.\nThe Universe is a great problem to be \nsolved and Truth is the unknown quantity\nin the equation.  For uncounted centuries\nmen have been straining forward towards\na grasp of the fundamentals regulating the\ngreat Cosmos.  The astronomer sounds \nthe depths of space in search of a limit to\nthe material universe.  The physicist\nprobes the secrets of a drop of water for\nthe live that is hidden from the naked eye.\nThe chemist is busy pulling atoms to pieces\nand putting them back together in his effort\nto unravel the chemical and physical\nrationale of all the vital processes.  The\nexplorer seeks to cross those snowy wastes\nwhere the ice-packs grind in the gale and\nthe dazzling light of the sun fades away into\nthe unbroken gloom of the long Arctic\nnight.  The sociologist and the psychologist \nare daily detecting and collating the\nfacts which pertain to the mind in order to\ndiscover the basis of human activity.  The \nwhole race of man is in a state of intellectual\nparturition and those who help to sweep\nonward the progress of Truth are the only \nones who occasionally throw a flash of faith\nacross the world.\nTime and again men have shouted \"Eureka\"\nat the sight of mirages which they\nthought were Eldorados.  Still the lives\nof these men were not in vain.  They have\nbuilded scaffolds upon which others have\nclimbed.  They have given inspiration to\nthose daring spiritual and intellectual scouts\nwho have approached to the outskirts of\nthat great world of thought and life and\noccasionally ensnared a straying fragment\n\nof truth.\nSome nay doubt the regnancy of truth\nover love.  To us love is but an emotion\nkindled by the true and the beautiful, a \ndeep-seated sentiment which reaches out\ntowards the ideal.  Eros yearns for and\nworships Truth, beyond and above which\nthere is and can be nothing.  No pleasure\nis so sweet as the pleasure derived from \nsporting with and exploring the upper \ncurrents.  The pursuit and elaboration of\nTruth is a pleasure that is refined and enduring.\nThe vast embacement of Truth\nencloses and comprehends all that is wise\nand just and beautiful in the universe.\nTruth is the precious life-blood of all\nthat is distinguished in art, science or literature.\nThose monarchs of the mind, the\nself-sceptered kings who by their immortal\ncreations have shed the luster of their\ngenius on the world, must of all men, be\nthe most happy.  No loftier feeling could\ncome to mankind that the feeling which\nmust come to him to whom it has been\ngiven to hold aloft the torch of wisdom.\nThe Truth is the one thing worth while\nin all the world, for while other things\ncome to the grave with their mouths shut,\nour faith in Truth, our love for the Eternal\nenables us to peer beyond the veil.\nWhen the fierce onward rush of the inevitable\nmoment comes, when the lights burn\nlow and the boat is ready to sail for the\nother shore, no devouring ogre over there\ncan terrify if we have followed the lights\ngiven down here.  The cords will be snapped\nand the golden bowl shattered only\nthat we might tread the golden highway\nto the gates ajar.  Then, those things which\nare veiled in the darkness of opacity and\nall the infinite reaches of the Universe\nwhich lie beyond our senses and which\nhave evaded many centuries of toilsome\nresearch will be made manifest.

Colored people\nwho travel know that they have never been received with open arms at\nNorthern hotels. If they have never had the experience themselves, they\nhave heard from some friend or from a goodly number, perhaps, how they\nhave been turned away from Northern hotels by proprietors who cooly told \nthem they were \"full\" and had no room.

More stupid than blind would they be, \nif they failed to understand the significance of the North's submission to\nthe South, in nearly everything relating to the status of the Negro. Nothing could be further from the fact, therefore than the\nstatement that much of the race hatred and strife and many of the most\nheinous crimes committed by the colored people of this country may be attributed \nto teachings inculcated by the North and to the belief generally \nentertained by colored people that they will be sustained by the whole people\nof the North, no matter what injury they inflict upon the white men\nand women of the South.\nIt would be difficult to find a colored man or woman in this country intelligent \nenough to form and opinion and express it, who has never been\nled into believing that the Northern whites would interfere and help \"put\ndown the Southern whites\", as Mr Page alleges \"It was done fifty years \nago\", he exclaims tragically, \"it is not strange that it should be though \npossible again\". As a rule, even the most ignorant Negro understands that\nwhile slavery was indirectly the cause of the Civil War, the real cause \nwas the South's determination to secede and the North's desire to preserve \nthe Union intact.

Again, if Mr. Page believes \nso implicitly that the white race is by nature and has always been \nby nature superior to all other races, it seems strange indeed, that he \nshould give himself so much concern about maintaining a thing which is as \ntruly sui generis and peculiar to his race as are its white face and hands. \n\nIt is a work of superogation to place a protective tariff upon a superiority \nordained by God, so that the naturally inferior race can never have \na chance to compete with it on equal terms. Special privileges and advantages \nare usually given to the weak and not to the strong. \n\nIn discussing the race problem Mr. Page seems utterly unable to adjust himself \nto new conditions, which accounts for many of his vagaries and mistakes. \nThe old time negro- the slaves - with their enforced, but to Mt. \nPage, delectable ignorance, with their child-like nature, their rolicking \nhumor, their banjo, their grin, their song and their jog. Ah, there was a \nnegro as is a negro for Mr. Thomas Nelson Page. But deliver that gentleman, \nye gods and little fishes, from an intelligent, perhaps college bred \nnegro! Deliver him, above all, from a negro who dares assert his right to \nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and the various privileges and \nimmunities of citizenship which Mr. Page believes as a white man he is entitled \nto enjoy. And just this inability to reconcile himself to the fact \nthat the victory of the Union forces metamorphosed the slave into a man is \nthe rock on which not only Mr. Page but many other Southeners wreck. \nMr. Page always waxes warm in speech and lachrymose about the eye, whenever \nhe mentions the old-time negro, the former slave. He tells affecting \n\n23 \n\nstories about the charity bestowed upon the ex-slaves all over the South. \nThey are settled, he says, in homes which cost them nothing and can be fed \nfor the asking. And this is the only type of Afro-American which Mr. Page \nseems genuinely to admire - a type which he regards as he would a horse that \nhad rendered valuable service as a burden bearer all his life and which\nshould be fed and sheltered - not shot in its old age, for the good it had \ndone. But the intelligent, self-respecting Negro has no ambition whatsoever\nto ingratiate himself into Mr. Page's affection and good graces by \nvoluntarily sustaining the relation toward him which his ancestors were \nforced to endure toward their masters. \n\nWhen Mr. Page states that the attacks and lynchings which shocks \nthe sense of the civilized world are but a manifestation of the \"fierce \nrace feeling\" that is growing up, he undoubtedly states a fact. When he \nstates that this \"fierce race feeling\" is due to the Negro's desire to be \n\"equal with the white man, as he (the negro) understands equality,\" he\nstates only a portion of a fact. The clause \"as the negro understands \nequality\" is inserted both to justify the South in denying the right of \ncitizenship to the colored man and to poison the mind of those inclined \nto demand justice for him. The \"fierce race feeling\" in the South is due in \ngreat part to the hatred which the class called the poor whites (a term \nwhich is very objectionable to myself) feels toward educated, thrifty colored\npeople. This hatred is inspired to a great extent by the object lessons \nin thrift and prosperity which hundreds of colored people have given         \ntheir white neighbors, some of whom are quite shiftless in the South. \nThe wrath of an infuriated bull, before whose frenzied eyes a red rag \nis tauntingly waved, is a feeble attempt at temper, compared with the indignation \nand rage experienced by some southern white people (not the best \nclass), when they behold a Negro, well educated, well dressed and well to \ndo.

Let the non-white races come together somehow.\n     An interesting health survey has just been made in Hagerstown, a\ncommunity consisting of 8,000 white people in western Maryland.  The result\nof this investigation is considered especially valuable, because it\nis based upon facts obtained from a population exclusively white.  The report\ndiscloses that there is less sickness among persons in the early twenties\nthan at any other age.  The death toll during infancy and early childhood\nis decidedly higher than during period of late childhood and adolescence\nbecause babies are more susceptible to disease than they are a few years\nlater.  The people die from organic diseases, the investigation shows\nwhile children fall victims to respiratory ills.  Since the various diseases\nhave been listed and a record has been given which shows how susceptible to\n[to] them each age is, this is said to be one of the most important health\ncharts which has ever been made.  The health returns from Hagerstown will be\nconsulted by specialists all over the world.  It is the first time that results\nbased on age groups have ever been undertaken.\n     Some newspapers have been engaged in playing the little game of\n\"Suppose.\"  It is well known that Congress violated the Constitution which\n\n\n\n3\nis thinner and more delicate, because they have lived in countries where there\nwas less sunlight to toughen the and where it was so cold they had to wear\nclothes.  [Germs find it easier to enter thin skin than tough]  Colored races in tropical countries go about practically nude as a\nrule.  The doctors who have been making a study of the subject claim also that\nthe lining of the throat and mouth is closely related to the outer skin\nand that if the outer skin ringing through the lining of the threat and mouth\nwill be also.  It is much easier for germs to enter a thin skin than a tough one.\nAll this sounds very plausible and it is certainly very encouraging.  It is\ngratifying to know that in a country where white people with thin skins rule\nthe roost there is some advantage in being dark with a tough ones.\n     If you dont want to vote for either Hoover or Al Smith, there is another\noutstanding personality for when you can cast your ballot.  Our friend J. Thomas\nHeflin of Alabama is a candidate.

The world would be a much safer and much\nhappier place to live in, if everybody who circulated poisonous stories about the \ncharacter and conduct of others was sent to jail.

There is \nno earthly reason for the existence of peonage\n today. The prosperity of the South \nwithin the past few years has been unprecedented\n and especially has this been true\n of the farming interests. In the ordinary \ncourse of making crops, without any coercion \nwhatever on the part of of the landlord\n toward his help, returns have been ample \nand profits gratifying. there has been entire \nsatisfaction on the part of both landlord \nand tenant. The peon-holder, by reason \nof his failure to properly pay, feed or \nclothe his laborers and by the unusual labor \nrequired of them, may have reaped \nmore in dollars than his honest neighbors \nwho would have none of the iniquitous \nbusiness, but he nevertheless, while gaining \nin dollars, has lost in the respect and \nconfidence of those neighbors, which in the \nend proves a greater loss to him than can \nbe compensated for by the blood mony he \nhas received. \n\nThere is no reason to believe \nthat his hands would not stay with \nhim as cheerfully without the five year contract \nas they would bound down under it \nor would not work just as hard provided \nthey were given just treatment. The peon-holder\n has decided that the best way to deal \nwith the Negro tenant is the hardest way. \nThis is demonstrably an erroneous conclusion,\n for of all races the Negro race is lead \nmost easily by kindness and cheerful encouragement. \nIt will be a brighter day for \n\nthe South when the blight of the peonage which \nhangs over certain portions of it like a pall \nwill be completely eradicated.\n\nThen Indeed will a stronger \nsense of trustfulness exist between employer \nand employee and then too, will \nthe black laborer show that he \nwas as much to be trusted working for \nthe peon-holder as a free man as under quasi \nslavery conditions. It is an end earnestly\n looked forward to by all people black and \nwhite alike who have the best interest of\n the South at heart, and who are mindful \nof the things that impede the entire section\n in its progress. These are the people\n who show no quarter to the peon-holder \nand it will be to their efforts coupled with \nthat of the strong and firm hand of the law \nthat the unrighteous system will fall in the \nwhole South as it is now toppling in certain \nsections. The courts are punishing \noffenders with clock-like regularity when \nthe evidence seems to warrant it, and public \nsentiment is slowly but surely crystallizing \nagainst the South's modern slavery. \nThe peon-holder sees through it all \nthat though his doom may be delayed it is \nnevertheless certain, and the day is not so\n far in the future when is brutal overseer \nwill make his last call in the gray-hours \nof the early dawn to the cabins for \nevery man, woman and child to \"hide out\" \nand will draw his last whelp across the \nbacks of his defenceless victim with his \nmonstrous bull-whip. The courts of justice\n and the great arbiter--public sentiment--\nare working out a noble victory for \nthe South.\n\n\nWould Racial Immigration Be Most Beneficial \nTo The American Negro\nBy Clarence O. L. Garrett\n\nIf I were to say the condition of the Negro \nin America is better than it could be in\n some other country, there would be many \nto dispute me. If I were to make the brave\n statement that the Negro should immigrate \nto the land from whence he came, the majority \nof you would pronounce me a fanatic. \nDid I possess the power of eloquence to paint \na vivid a picture before you as could Booker \nT. Washington himself, I could not portray \nfor you too beautifully the future of \nthe Negro in America.\n\nSurrounded as we are by enemies on \nevery side, handicapped as a race by the \nstigma which the ban of slavery has left \nupon us ; our rights, social and moral and\n political all disregarded, I am told the Negro \ncan do naught but rise, for as many \nhave said, oppression is the motive power \nof success.\n\nOften, oh how often, have I regarded the\n Negro as some gigantic spring which, under\n the weight of oppression, has been \ncrushed below the level of suffering humanity, \nand which spring by the relaxation of \nweight caused by the civil war sprang forth\n into its wonted state of activity! And so \nstrong has the race been in the glory of its\n strength that it has never been forced back \nto a comparative degree of servitude, though\n the weight has been increased many fold.\n\nTruly, the future of the Negro in \nAmerica, as viewed from this standpoint,\n is most beautiful, and great are the heights \nto which he would attain if this were only\n true. But has the Negro thus cast off his\n burden? Has he really arisen to the \nheight to which this picture places him? \nAnswer it fairly and impartially, and despite\n your unwillingness, you will be compelled\n\n to answer that it is not true. True, the \nNegro has arisen from the degredation of \nslavery ; but can he look back upon that \nriver of blood whose only banks are the \nbodies of heroes fallen in a fiercely-waged \ncontest ; can the Negro, I say, look back \nupon that river and say : \"There flows untainted \nthe blood of my brethren who have \nwon a good fight and who have died that I \nmight live?\"\n\nIn answer, I may be referred to the far-famed \nBlack Regiment, a gallant, great and\n glorious body of men, I must admit ; but\n a single regiment savors of the individual \nand I am speaking of a race. Can any man\n show me a spot of this land of ours and \nsay here was a victory won by a Negro army \nled by Negro generals? Can any man \npoint me to a successful military or national\n campaign planned throughout by Negro \nofficers? Lives there a man with so little\n foresight who would venture that in the \nnext decade that we should have a Negro \ncommanding officer of the Union forces \nwith no superior? Literally, there is none.\n\nThat the Negro could make unlimited \nprogress in other countries, not even the\n most sanguine can doubt. For though \nmany express the belief that the black man \ncannot prosper in any other country than \nthis, there is undeniable truth to the contrary. \nThe fact that Tanner, the colored \nartist, has won such wonderous success in \nParis ; the numberless instances sighted us \nby Bishop Turner where the Negro has both \nfame and fortune ; the knowledge handed \ndown to us by history and tradition proving \nbeyond a reasonable [doubt that the lordly \nEgyptians who were African in their fibre \nwere the founders of that commercial spirit", "76", 46, 46, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00180", "arriving around eleven or \ntwelve.

True the iron heel of oppression\n is grinding down upon him, but \nlike Israel of old, the more he is oppressed, \nthe more he prospers.\n\nI am hopeful for the Negro because I \nhave faith in the ultimate triumph of right.\n Wrong and unjust treatment of the Negro \nmay truimph for the moment, but in that \nvery triumph is its death knell. Necessity \nis not only the mother of invention but the \nsoul of progress, the genius of civilization. \nNecessity has reached forth her hand, and \nthe Negro must obey her mandates. There\n is no alternative save total annihilation. \nThe Negro is said to be poor, degraded, \nignorant. He is surrounded on all sides by \nthose who are inimical to him and his designs. \nIt would seem to an observer that \none  so low could never hope to rise, but \nfor \"A' that and for a' that, a man's a man \nfor a' that,\" and it is not a man who will \nmeekly bow his head and yield to circumstances.\n Necessity, the mother of progress, \nthe soul and genius of civilization, \nbids him come, and he hastens in her direction. \nHis limbs may tire, his feet may\n blister, his strength may ever fail, but he \nwill not pause until round by round he shall \nhave climbed the ladder she has placed before \nhim, at the top of which is emblazoned\n the word success.\n\nYesterday the monarch of injustice and\n prejudice reigned supreme. Today the \nreign of justice and right has begun. Fear \nnot the outcome; look ye upon the strength, \nnot upon the weakness of the Negro.

Trust the Negro now \nand the future will take care of itself. \nWhen asked why Antipater was not clothed\n in purple, Alexander replied : \"These men \nwear purple on the outside, Antipater is \nroyal within.\" So it is with the Negro. \nThe Negro is not that animal of the brute\n creation which some picture him to be, but \nhe is an intellectual human being endowed \nwith reasoning powers and capable of respecting \nthose powers in others.\n\nThe Negro of yesterday feared to even \ngaze upon the vintage of this world; the \nNegro of today reaches out his hand and \nplucks the best fruitage of the highest and \ngrandest age of men. Even liberty, yes \ntrue liberty a plant that grows luxuriantly \nonly when watered with human blood and \nrooted in the hearts and affections of a free \npeople, is is within the very grasp of the \nAmerican Negro.\n\nAnd now as we recount the appreciation \nof the bravery shown by the American Negro \nat San Juan hill, the liberal concessions \nof wondrous oratorical talent of Pickens \nat Yale, the universal acknowledgement \nof Booker T. Washington's worth as \na leader, and the renown given Clarence \nMatthews as an athlete at Harvard, we are\n left in the quandary, whether racial immigration \nwould be most beneficial. But as \nby mutual instinct a hive of honeybees \nfollows the common leader, as at all trying \nand critical moments does nature put forth \none of her noblemen to take the lead, so \nhas the Negro learned that in unity there \nis strength, and so in the near future will\n he put forth one of his own race who like \na mariner guiding a tempost-tossed vessel, \nshall take hold of the helm of events and \nguide them past danger after danger, surmount \nobstacles after obstacles, until at \nlength he shall guide them into a harbor \nof safety.\n\nOUR ADVERTISING SECTION.\n\nThe following pages are devoted wholly to\n the interests of our advertisers.

The climate is a \nsalubrious one. The gentle stir of the sea \nbreeze as it wafts inland the smell of the \nsalt sea water and rustles gently among the \nleaves ; the sweet song of birds as they skip \nfrom bough to bough, making the forest \necho with the melody of their song ; the \nbrilliant hues of the surrounding vegetation, \nand the odorous perfume of tropical \nflowers which permeate the air, all unite to \npresent to the tourist, the botanist, the naturalist, \na paradise sublime. But to these \npoor wanderers it is no paradise  It is a \nplace of refuge, a place of rest, yet such \nrest as shall require toil and privation. A \nrest requiring practice, perseverance and \npatience. Practice of economy, financial, \nsocial and physical. A perseverance that \nwill surmount all obstacles and that will \ncause them to adhere to their project with \nbulldog tenacity. Such as will give ultimate \nsuccess, though death itself betide. \nA patience that will await complete developments. \nNot a patience that will allow \nthe first budding of success to sweep away \ntheir mental equilibrium, but one that will \nbe a paragon for the world in the future.\n\nThere is no shelter here for these people \nexcept for the bark that brought them. \n\nWhen the little supply of food stored away \nin her hull is exhausted there is no way of \nreplenishing it save by their own ingenuity. \nHaving been accustomed all the days of \ntheir existence to be lead and directed by \nmembers of a so-called superior race, they \nare for the moment handicapped when they \nare left without one. But for the moment \nonly. Then comes forward one who, although \nunknown in America, soon proves \nhimself to be a leader of men, capable of \ncoping with the most efficient. Under the \ndirection of this leader a few huts of boughs \nand clay, are first built, to be rapidly replaced \nby better, stronger and more attractive \nbuildings. Thoroughfares are planned, \ndivisions of land are staked out, a corps of \nofficials are selected and soon a crude but \nthriving village stands where a few minutes \nbefore Nature unadorned reigned supreme.\n\n'Tis needless to follow them as they toil, \nbut let us leave them for a score of years \nand return on a visit. We have learned \nmany strange stories about these people \nwhom we left some twenty years ago, regarding \nthem as little more than savages. \nYes, we have learned that they are a great \nnation occupying not only the little village \nin which we left them, but all of the surrounding \ncountry of which the village is \nthe capital. And now we shall test for ourselves \nthe truth of these stories which have \nsounded to our ears as wondrous tales of \nfiction.\n\nAs we cross the borderline of this country--\nfor it is a great country, we perceive \non either side of us well-regulated farms \nladen with the season's produce--here and \nthere we see an humble but well-kept cottage \nwith an occasional flock of barnyard \nfowls strutting proudly about. Further on \nis a substantial country residence giving \nforth proof that its owner has been more \nsuccessful as the world goes than his fellow-man. \nWhile the rare exotic plants and \nflowers which require the utmost care and \n\n\nRACIAL IMMIGRATION  447\n\nattention even in a tropical climate prove \nthat the young mistress whom we see flitting \nabout among them must be a person \nof culture and refinement to appreciate the \ndelicate radiance of love which they shed \nabout the home.\n\nAnd now as we approach the city and \nhear the hum and roar of machinery, the \nshriek of the locomotive, the puffing and \nhissing of some giant steamer as she is leaving \nthe wharves laden with merchandise, \nthe hustle and clatter accompanying all \nbusiness centres, the harsh clang of the fire \nalarm in the distance, and the subdued tolling \nfuneral bells near us, we are struck \nwith the likeness of this African capital to \nsome of our own great American cities. \nThreading our way through the streets, we \nare astonished, yes even appalled, by the \ngrandeur and magnificence of their architecture. \nWe at length arrive at the office \nof the city's highest official, who shows us \nthe record of the great people from the time \nof their immigration. He shows us their \nbusiness enterprises, their schools, their \ncolleges, their churches, their homes. He\n tells us that financially this nation stands \nsecond to none. He also tells us that in \nthese later days it ranks as one of the \nworld's seven greatest powers. And this, \nyes all this, was accomplished by Negro \nbrain and brawn.\n\nAnd now as Old Sol sinks slowly beneath \nyon western skies, and bathes in living glory \nthis African land of the free and home \nof the brave, as the dying sunlight glints \nand scintillates on the window of yon towering \nstructure rising above its fellows ; as \nit rests for a moment on the spire of the\n cathedral and as it is flashed back from the \ndome of the capitol, we are convinced that \nracial immigration was the Negro's most \nbeneficial step.\n\nTo leave the opposite side of this question \nundiscussed would be an injustice to \n\nthe Negro, for it is possible for the Negro \nto establish for himself here in America a \nfuture more brilliant, aye a thousand times \nmore brilliant, than the world's greatest \nnation of today. We are told that the Negro \nof America shall never be the social \ncompanion of the Anglo-Saxon. We are \ntold that between the Negro and his fellow-man \nthere exists an unsurmountable barrier. \nWe admit that the iron heel of oppression \nis grounding us into the dust of \nthe earth. We know that the serpent of \nprejudice is in our midst. Yet I am hopeful. \nI am hopeful because of the progress \nthe Negro has made and is making in intelligence \nand wealth.\n\nTake the matter of wealth. Since freedom \nhundreds and thousands of our people \nhave become property owners in the South. \nToday the American Negro is paying taxes \nupon millions of dollars worth of property, \nwhich, when you compare the thirty-nine \nyears in which we have acquired it, to the \ncenturies spent by the Anglo-Saxon in accumulating \nhis possessions, even the most \npessimistic must admit that the comparison \nis most favorable.\n\nWas social equality the Negro's highest \nambition, his greatest desire would soon be \nsatisfied, and the Negro of tomorrow would \nbe but little better than the Negro of today. \nBut social equality is not the height of the \nNegro's ambition, it is a mere trifle, a bagatelle \nas compared with the whale. That \nambition that caused John Brown to rise up \nin his might at Harper's Ferry and throw \noff the fetters of slavery for a crown of glory ; \nthat ambition which led Frederick \nDouglass to become a leader of his race ;\n that ambition which cause Toussaint \nL'Overture to attempt and succeed in forging \na thunderbolt out of that mixed and, \nas you say, despicable mass of Negroes ; \nthat ambition which upheld Antonio Maceo \nin his great struggle for Cuba Libre ; that", "77", 46, 46, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00190", "Evergreen\n4865 Phila\nPhone number.\n\nHello Mother.\nHere we are.\nThe trip was delightful\nThe Gilberts are here with us. \nSee you soon.\nTake care of yourself,\nDevotedly Phippie \n\nMrs. Mary Church Terrell\n1615 S.

JENKINS, Vice-President Hertel, Jenkins & Co. \nFord's Hair Pomade was formerly known as \"OZONIZED OX MARROW,\" and is the only safe preparation\nknow to us that makes kinky of curly hair straight.  Its use makes the most stubborn, harsh, kinky or curly hair \nsoft, pliable and easy to comb.  These results may be obtained from one treatment; 2 to 4 bottles are usually sufficient \nfor a year.  The use of Ford's Hair Pomade (\"OZONIZED OX MARROW\") removes and prevents dandruff,\nrelieves itching, invigorates the scalp, stops the hair from falling out or breaking off, makes it grow, and by nourishing \nthe roots, gives it new life and vigor.  Being elegantly perfumed and harmless, it is a toilet for ladies, gentlemen\nand children.  Ford's Hair Pomade (\"OZONIZED OX MARROW\") has been made and sold continuously since\nabout 1858, and the label, \"OZONIZED OX MARROW,\" was registered in the United States Patent Office in 1874.\nIn all that long period of time there has never been a bottle returned from the hundreds of thousands we have sold.\nFord's Hair Pomade remains sweet and effective no matter how long you keep it.  Be sure to get Ford's, as\nits use makes the hair STRAIGHT, SOFT and PLIABLE.  Beware of imitations.  Remember that Ford's Hair\nPomade (\"OZONIZED OX MARROW\")  is put up only in 50c. size, and is made only in Chicago and by us.  The\ngenuine has the signature, Charles Ford, Prest., on each package.  Refuse all others.  Full directions with every bottle.\nPrice only 50c.  Sold by druggists an dealers.

Many colored people believed that Professor Frost was\nresponsible for this decision which closed Berea College in their faces\nand they were very bitter towards him in consequence. \nI can not discuss the merits or the demerits of the case intelligently, \nbecause I did not investigate it for myself. While Professor Frost\ntaught in Oberlin College he was so free from race prejudice that I was\nsurprised to hear that he had been accused of exhibiting it anywhere. I \ncould not help wondering whether he was affected by his environment in the\nSouth as are so many northern white people who go there to live. Among\ncolored people it is regarded as an axiom that when northern white people\nmove to the South, they frequently exhibit more prejudice towards the colored\nrace and are harder to get along with than the southern whites. \nIf that is so, there's a reason. I have heard northern white folks\nsay that when they go south to live, they can not succeed in business, in\nthe professions or along any other line, while both they and there families\nare socially ostracized, as a rule, if they do not prove both by word and by\ndeed that they heartily subscribe to the South's attitude on the Race\nProblem. \nIn my Freshman year I attended the Bible Class regularly and believe\nit benefitted me greatly. I really looked forward to it with enthusiasm\nand pleasure, becuase I was allowed to ask questions about the\npassages in the Scripture which troubled me. And no verse came nearer\nshaking my faith in the justice of God than the one which states, \"I, the\nLortd thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon\nthe children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and\nshowing mercy unto thousands of them who love me and keep my commandments.\"\nI could not understand why a just and loving father should make\ninnocent children suffer for the sins committed by their foreparents. The\ninjustice of the law of heredity stunned me. It seemed terrible to me that\nthe children of drunkards should inherit a tendency to drink immoderately,\nand the children of thieves might have a hard time to be honest, and so on\nthrough the category of vices. The teacher was patient with me and did his\nbest to show me why such a dispensation was just, but I was never able to \nsee it in that light. However, I decided not to try to understand it any\nlonger. I finally brought a semblance of peace to my mind saying \"I am \nfinite and if I understood all the plans of the Infinite I should be equal\n38\nto him in wisdom, which would be unthinkable and absurd, of course.\" Even so,\nmy poor brain often whirled and my heart was often sad, as I wrestled with\nthe problem of heredity. \nWhen I tackled Geometry in the prepatory department of the college\nI met my Waterloo sure enough. I struggled hard to do the work, but I did\nnot understand how to go about it properly and I barely pulled through the\ncourse. How I loathed Plane Geometry. It wounded my pride and \"hurt my feelings,\"\nbecause it was so hard for me to understand. \nI did a little better in Solid Geometry, but I did not \"set the world\nafaire,\" even in that. Finally I grew desperate and decided it was a waste of \ntime and energy for me to try to understand a proposition and I calmly made\nup my mind to commit to memory the letters on a figure and say, big TAB is\nto a little tab as big AB is to little ab without having the slightest idea\nwhat it was all about. \nNo teacher who wished to \"show off\" his class in Mathematics would\never have called on Mollie Church to recite in college, any more than a teacher\nin the public schools would have exhibited my drawing book to show the\nskill to which his pupil had attained. When visitors came to our class in \nthe public school and asked to see our books in which we had done free hand\ndrawing or had copied objects, no teacher ever showed mine. She usually\nmanaged to put mine at the bottom of the pile. \nTry as I might, I could never learn to draw. If I set out to draw a \nstraight line, it would turn out to be crooked. And if I wanted to draw a \ncrooked line, it was more apt to be crooked. My brother inherited some\nof my mother's talent for painting and drawing, while I inherited none. \nIn my Freshman year I was was elected class poet, unanimously, and read a \npoem at the Class Day excerises which were held a short time before Commencement. \nI chose as my subject, \"The Fallen Star,\" and imitated the hexameter\nused by Longfellow in Hiawatha.

WEBSTER\nPresident of the Chicago Savings Bank and one of the strong supports of Provident Hospital: Spoken\nof among the colored people as \"One of God's Noblemen.\"\n\nhave been able to learn, Prof. Pickens is the\nonly black man with an Esperanto diploma.\nProf. Pickens now has correspondence in this\nnew language with French, Russians, Scotch,\nAfricans, Japanese, Germans, Scandinavians\nand the islands of the sea.  He will give to\nour readers some accounts of this correspondence\nduring the year.\n\nThe Colored\nSoldiers Again\n\nThe president's message\nto Congress, December\n19, in which he undertakes\nto defend his extraordinary course in\nsummarily discharging without honor a whole\nbattalion of colored soldiers contains a world\nof assertion with less than a mustard seed of\n\nproof.  All of his harsh adjectives and noisy\ndeclarations fail to convince one of either the\njustice or reasonableness of his course.  He\nbases his message on the reports by Generals\nGarlington, Blocksom, Lovering and Nettleton\nand also the annual report of Secretary\nTaft.  In none of their reports is there a\nshred of evidence that goes to establish the\nguilt of men in the black battalion.  Let us\nsee what all of these reports go to establish.\nIt is thoroughly established that there was\nshooting in Brownsville on the night of August\n13.  It seems to be thoroughly established\nthat one man was killed and another\nwounded.  Absolutely nothing else has been\nestablished.  Suspicion points to the colored \n\n\nTHE VOICE     543\n\nsoldiers as the men who did the shooting.\nFirst, white men of Brownsville had mistreated\nand insulted black soldiers repeatedly.\nThe a priori theory would be that resentment\nwas bound to follow. Second, white\nmen of Brownsville declare that the men who\ndid the shooting were colored men in khaki\nsuits and blue shirts.  Third, the bullets that\nwere taken out of the walls of houses and\ncartridge shells picked up roundabout were\nof the type of the army ammunition.  Fourth,\nno soldier admitted guilt when questioned\nand no soldier admitted of any knowledge of\nwho did the rioting.  The remarkable conclusion\nof the president and his inspectors is\nthat therefore the colored soldiers are guilty\nof the shooting.  They are guilty of the shooting\nbecause of the first three statements and\nare guilty of a conspiracy of silence because\nof the fourth statement;--that is, because\nnone of the soldiers admitted guilt or pointed\nout a guilty man, therefore, there was a conspiracy. \nThis is the weakest piece of reasoning\nwe have seen in many a moon.  The\nConstitution League and others interested\nhave made investigations.  If they have not\nproved their case, they have at least advanced\narguments which outweigh anything which\nMr. Roosevelt has said.  First, it is clearly\nestablished that Garlington's report was obscured\nin the fogs of race prejudice.  The\npresident's loud assertions that race did not\ncount seems unreasonable when we know that\nGarlington based his recommendations\nmainly on the alleged fact that it is a racial\ntrait for Negroes to conceal crime and therefore\nthere \"appeared to be\" \"a conspiracy of\nsilence\" among these soldiers.  Mr. Roosevelt\nbased his message mainly on this narrow\nSoutherner's report, and his loud protestations\nof the absence of race prejudices in the matter\nvanishes to the doubtful point when we consider\nthat fact.  Second, General Nettleton,\nof Illinois, made his investigation and report\nupon the invitation of the white citizens of\nBrownsville and not by the orders of the\ngovernment.  Reasonable people reserve the\nright to believe that Nettleton would not\nhave been thus invited to investigate had not\nthe Brownsville people known aforetime his\npredilections on the rioting.  Third, immediately\nafter the shooting began the sentry\nfired his piece three times in order to arouse\nthe garrison.  A roll call showed that every\nman was in his place and an examination of \n\nthe rifles showed that all were clean and\nloaded.  The sergeants all testify that all the\nguns were in the racks when unlocked.\nOne of the superior officers declared that\nthese men were \"the best disciplined, best behaved\nand best regulated battalion in the\nUnited States army.\"  In the face of these\nfacts we respectfully submit that there is\ndoubt that anybody in this battalion is guilty\nof murder, spite of the president's cocksure\nassertions.\n\nA Reasonable\nTheory\n\nA far more reasonable\ntheory is advanced by the\ncolored man who was interviewed\nby Raymond, of the Chicago\nTribune.  This colored man of national fame\nsays that khaki garb is common among the\ncolored population of Brownsville, as many of\nthe men buy the discarded clothes of the\nsoldiers.  It is also true that many of the \ntownspeople had army cartridges, the soldiers\nhaving given them to them as souvenirs.  The\npersistent discriminations practiced against\nthe colored soldier in white saloons had led\nto the establishment of a colored saloon.  The\nsoldiers, who always spent their money freely,\nnow boycotted the white saloons and patronized\nthe colored saloon exclusively.  This angered\nthe white saloonkeepers.  Southern\nwhite people want the money of the black\npeople, but they want him to accept humiliations\nas a part of the value of his money.  The\nwhites, so says this colored man, decided to\nbreak up this Negro saloon.  The colored\npeople got on to the plan and were prepared.\nOn August 13 a riot, begun by whites, was\nparticipated in by black townspeople who\nwore soldiers' clothes and used army ammunition,\nor at least enough of it to save the\nBrownsville blacks from suspicion.  This\nsounds reasonable.  The other theory is utterly\nunreasonable in the light of facts so far disclosed.\nNobody objects to drastic action\nagainst crime.  We all say, if there are guilty\nmen in the colored companies, bring them to\njudgment.  But it is altogether un-American\nto hold that a man is guilty of a crime because\nhe denies knowledge of it.  Nothing\nshows so plainly beggardliness of principle as\nMr. Roosevelt's strong adjectives.  They\nprove nothing.  He has never had the hardihood\nto explain to the country that the reason\nhe refrained from discharging these soldiers\nuntil after the election was over was for", "105", 147, 147, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00163", "43\nupon me, pointed her bony finger at me and said most impressively, \"Young\nwoman, laugh and be merry, while you can, and as much as you can.

Both her husband and young daughter\nhad died within a short time of each other and she could not forget it, or\nbecome reconciled to her loss. She had come to the college to study to try\nto divert her mind from her grief, but had not succeeded in doing so. \nMonths before I graduated from Oberlin I realized that the carefree\ndays of my youth would soon be a thing of the past. I dreaded leaving \nmy friends behind and going out into the \"cold world.\" But the desire\nto get my diploma and to receive my degree was an obsession with me. When\nI said my prayers at night I used to emphasize the fact, as much as I dared while talking to the Lord, that He could send any affliction whatsoever upon \nme He saw fit, if He would only let me live to graduate. I begged Him not\nto let me die before Commencement day. \nI did not see how any student could have enjoyed the activities of\ncollege life more than I did. Learning my lessons as well as I could was\nsort of an indoor sport with me. I had my trials and tribulations, of course\nbecause occasionally I broke the rules by going skating without permission, \nfor instance, or breaking the study hour rule, or sitting up after ten o'clock,\nbut that was all included in the course, I thought. I learned one\nthing outside the curriculum. Breakfast began at a quarter past six in the\nmorning. That did very well in the fall or spring, but in the cold, bitter\nwinter it was terrible to have to arise while it was as dark as midnight\nin a room with the temperature miles below zero, make a fire to keep from\nfreezing to death, and dress in time to be at the breakfast table fifteen \nminutes past six. \nI did not eat very much anyhow at that period. But students\nwere obliged to be in the dining room for morning prayers. So I calculated\nto a nicety the exact time when the bell would ring for the students to \nturn from the table to hear the Bible read. I would hop out of bed just\nfive minutes before that would happen and I learned to dress myself so\nquickly that I was never late for morning prayers during the whole time I \nboarded in Ladies Hall.\n44\nNeither one of my parents came to see me graduate from college. \nMy mother sent me a wonderful black jet dress, for the young women who graduated\nfrom the \"gentleman's course\", always dressed in sombre black, at that\ntime. She also sent me a pair of opera glasses as a graduation present. \nWhile this gift was greatly appreciated, it did not compensate me for her\nabsence on this occasion to which I had looked forward with such anticipations\nof pleasure, for so many years. \n", "23", 77, 77, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00286", "544     THE VOICE\n\nfear he would arouse public antagonism.\nThat was exceedingly brave.

SWAIN\n\n\"The Clansman\" was billed to appear in\nWorcester, Mass., on the evening of December\n10.  As soon as the bills were posted, a\nmass meeting of local colored people was\ncalled at one of their churches, on Belmont\nstreet.  About one hundred and fifty prominent\nmembers of the race were in attendance,\nand listened to stirring addresses from Dr.\nMacKerrow, president of the local Afro-American\nLeague, the three Negro clergymen\nof Worcester, and others prominent in public\nlife.\n\nThere were present also some white men,\nall of whom spoke in denunciation of \"The\nClansman\" and its purposes; notable among\nthe remarks of the evening being the eloquent\nappeal of Dr. Alexander F. Chamberlain,\na professor of Clark university, and a strong\nDemocrat.\n\nA petition was drawn up, signed by about\n300, and forwarded to Mayor Duggan, stating\nwhy, in the judgment of the petitioners,\nthe appearance of the play in Worcester\nwould tend to disturb the cordial relations\nwhich have always existed between the races\nhere.  No attempt was made to prepare a\nmonster petition; nor even to secure a solid\nNegro signature.  The petition contained the\nnames of all the prominent professional and\nbusiness men in the Negro population, and\nmany white names well known in clerical\nand educational circles.  A special effort was\nmade to divorce the petition and the mass\nmeeting from any political trend; all references\nto politics being sedulously avoided.\n\nNevertheless, the fact that the day following\nthe advertised appearance of \"The Clansman\"\nchanced to be a municipal election day,\nsomewhat complicated affairs.  Mayor Duggan\nwas a Democrat, serving in a strong Republican\ncity.  Many reasons were advanced\ntending to prove that he would refuse to\ngrant the petition, and as many tending to\nprove the contrary.\n\nThe representatives of Dixon's  \"Clansman\"\nappeared before him, setting forth their\nside of the case with much circumstance, and\nmaking several offers; one to take him to\nNew York at their expense, and allow him \n\nto see the play before deciding; another to select\na mixed black and white committee, give\nthem the best seats  in the house, allow them\nto confer immediately after the play, and if \nthey decided it to be objectionable, the receipts\nwere to be turned over to charity.\n\nUltimately Mayor Duggan, refusing all\nthese suggestions, forbade its local appearance,\nin the following letter to the theatrical management:\n\n\"Gentlemen:  A delegation of representative \ncolored people, citizens of Worcester, called upon\nme yesterday, and left a petition, bearing nearly\n300 names protesting against the production of the\nplay known as \"The Clansman\" at the Franklin \nSquare Theatre, Monday, December 10, 1906.\n\"The petition contains not only the names of colored\npeople, but the signatures of many of Worcester's\nwhite citizens.  The colored people of Worcester\nare interested in the growth and prosperity\nof our city.  They are law-abiding citizens and are\neducating their children in the public schools.  They\nhave comfortable homes and labor for the success\nand happiness of the members of their families.\nWe do not think it wise that their happiness should\nbe disturbed by the presentation of a play that is\ndistasteful to them.\n\"I recognize the fact that you have made preparation\nand have gone to considerable expense\nfor the staging of \"The Clansman,\" and I am exceedingly\nsorry that this action has to be taken,\nbut my promise that I would be mayor of all the\npeople of the city of Worcester is a sacred obligation\nand must be fulfilled.\n\"Having given the matter very careful consideration,\nI have come to the decision that the play \nentitled \"The Clansman\" and billed for the Franklin\nSquare Theatre, Monday, December 10, be not\nproduced.     \"Yours very respectfully,\n(Signed)     \"JOHN T.

In further reply to\nthe correspondent there mentioned, the editor\nsaid:\n\n\"We think the laws which . .  forbid intermarriage\nof the races are wicked, and that they\ntend to create many illegitimate unions. Doubtless\nour correspondent has known many such. We\nknow what sad difficulty teachers of the better\ncolored schools have in preventing their educated\nand cultivated girls from being snapped up by\nwhite men in respectable society and introduced into\nan irregular relation, which in New York would\nbe a common law marriage, or which is a virtual\npolygamy. And with no visible sense of shame, indeed\nwith a sense of duty, the fathers bring their\nchildren, still lighter than their mothers, to these\nbest Negro schools for education. We know of\nwhat we affirm, and can specify the instances.\"\n\nOne of the interesting aspects of such statements\nis that they do not appear to call forth\ntangible denials or to give those who make\nthem any trouble to prove their correctness.\n\nWith conditions such as the foregoing\nstatements indicate existing among those who\nare regarded as the better class of both races,\nit would probably be surprising not to find at\nleast as large a degree of intermixture occurring\nin the lower grades of society. Altogether,\non the part of those who know the\nsituation with any degree of accuracy or fullness,\nit is admitted without controversy that\nthere has not only been a fusion in the past\nwhich makes a very large proportion of those\nwho are called Negroes partake of white\nblood, but also that the fusion is being continued\nwithout intermission. Many of the \ncases, for fairly obvious reasons, could not easily\nbe proved in court, but those who know\nthe facts are well aware that the cases exist.\n\nIV\n\nIt will now be in place to gather inferences\nfrom the evidence which has been presented.\nSome of these instances have doubtless\nbeen reached already by the reader, since\nthe testimony is ample and tolerably clear.\n\nI. Perhaps the most obvious conclusion is,\nthat there seems never to have been any race\nintegrity, unless it be on the part of such individuals\nas have been careful to mingle their\nblood with those other individuals only who\ngave as good evidence as could be had of possessing\nthe same strains, whatever those\nchanced to be. Even in those cases, and on\nthe part of individuals who were most proud\n\nof the purity of their lineage, it might be difficult\nto secure the evidence to establish real \nrace integrity; for, if the evidence from the\nethnologists quoted above is worth anything, \nit would be no easy task for any one of European\ndescent to show that he was absolutely\nfree from all trace of Mongolian or African\nblood. This is the case if one adheres to the\ntechnical race distinctions, as Brinton, e.g.,\ndoes, recognizing only three, or five, races and\nclassing the Semites and all the original inhabitants\nof northern Africa as belonging to\nthe white race. If, instead of that, one takes\na practical view of the question, recognizing,\nas he probably would, that the Slavs are, on\nthis basis, perhaps as far from the Anglo-Saxon\nas were the followers of Genghis-Khan,\nhe will find it still more difficult to satisfy\nhimself that his ancestors were all of one race.\nit is hardly too much to say that race integrity\nis a fetish, before which otherwise enlightened\npeople constantly bow down. Instead\nof cringing before this powerless relic,\nit would be well to recognize the conclusion\nrecently stated by the late President William\nR. Harper concerning the Jews. His intimate\nknowledge of the history of Oriental\npeoples and conditions led him to write that\nhe \"has long been of the opinion that the best\nexplanation of the supreme position occupied \nby the Jews of today is to be found in the\nfact that no nation of antiquity absorbed from\nother nations to such an extent, or for so long\na period, as did the Jews\" (Biblical World,\n25:380). While this statement was made\nconcerning the Jews only, it could be shown\nto be true concerning other peoples as well,\nwithout difference unless it be in degree. For,\nif the word race is used in the practical sense\nproposed, and perhaps if it is used in the narrower\nsense, the Anglo-Saxon would easily\ncome forward as evidence of fusion and his\ncommanding position today be thereby explained.\nAs an individual example of the\nsame principle, in another direction, it may\nbe noted that one of the most resourceful, at\nleast, of southern Americans today, a man\nwho, in a few years and on the basis of a\ncomparatively meagre training, has built up\na great educational institution, one which is\nsaid to be the richest in the South and which\nthis man has brought to the point of international\nrecognition - it is well to recognize, I\nsay, that Mr. Booker T. Washington is a\nmulatto, and, at the same time, to remember\n\nTHE VOICE   571\n\nthat the mulatto has had only a short time in\nAmerica, comparatively speaking, in which to\ndemonstrate to the world his real power and\ncapacity to achieve.\n\n2. The figment of race integrity may be\nrecognized more fully when it is remembered\nthat \"the unity of the (human) race is now\ngenerally accepted\" (Encyclopedia Americana,\narticle \"Ethnology\"); a doctrine which\nis agreeable to both theology and science. Accordingly,\nsince man sprang from a single \nancestry, it matters little how much variety\nhas developed during the long course of his\nexperience on the earth; at foundation he is\none race. For present convenience, it may\nbe well to show the more marked characteristics,\nby geographic or color names, but an immense\nwaste of time will be avoided, and the bad\nodor of hard names will be escaped, if it is\nkept in mind that these terms are only matters\nof convenience and cannot mark off any individual,\nor community of individuals, as surely\nhaving only a pure white, or pure black, or\npure yellow, stream of blood coursing through\nits veins. And to do this does not in any way\nbelittle the science of ethnology, or suggest\nthat the facts of the human race must be left\nin confusion. Instead, it may be taken to\nsimplify the task of the ethnologist - leaving\nhim free to discover such facts as he can,\nwithout any feeling that either a people, or\nso-called race, is to have its standing affected\nthereby; relieving a man like Brinton, e.g., \nof the feeling that he must show the superiority\nof the white race at all points. Then\nperhaps, if, at some distant date, the material\nof ethnology should be come so complete as to\nmake a more detailed classification of mankind\npossible, one of the results would be to\nshow, even more clearly than is possible today,\nhow all the manifold peoples of the world\nare variant individuals and varying groups of\nthe one great family and the one common\nblood, manifesting, because of the varied experiences\nof its several parts, the many characteristics\nwhich we now behold.\n\n3. As a practical consideration, the\nthoughful person seems certain to ask himself\nwhether, in view of all the facts, he is justified \nin making a demand for race integrity.\nProbably the most he can do is to insist that\nrace mixture shall not go farther than it has;\nand no doubt this is all that the current demand\nis intended to mean. But, can even\n\nthis position be successfully maintained? If\nthe history of the race up to the present teaches\nanything, it probably teaches that such a demand\nwill not be heeded, certainly not within \nany portion of the immediate future. Even\nif the mingling of those peoples which we\nnow call races could be stopped entirely at\nthe present hour, or at any future assignable\ndate, would that mean anything for race integrity\nor offer any gain in matters of ethnology?\nIf harm has come from the mingling\nof varied strains of blood, no possible expedient,\nexcept the extinction of every individual\nwho cannot prove an alibi against the\ncharge of admixture - a practically impossible\ntask for any one, as has already been\nseen - can now stop the process and give the\nworld \"race purity.\" In fact, to stop the\nprocess at the present, or any similar stage,\nwould serve only to help prolong whatever\ncaste feeling and jealousies now exist as the\nresult of race characteristics, giving them\npermanence in their present form; and for\nthis state of affairs probably no intelligent\nperson has any desire.\n\n4. The demand for race integrity must\nfinally resolve itself into the question whether\nthe mingling of variant strains of human\nblood is a moral wrong in itself, in the offspring\nof such union entirely apart from the\nmotives or desires of the father and mother\nwho produced it. If it can be shown that\nsuch offspring bears in himself the evidence\nof moral guilt, entirely apart from the manner\nof life which he may present, then surely\nit may be maintained that race integrity is\nnot only necessary but capable of the most\nintelligent demands. The fact that moral\ndesideratum has neither existed in the past\nnor is likely to exist in any portion of the future\nwhich can be discerned, is not sufficient\nto silence the demand for that moral idea;\nthe mere striving for its attainment, however\nlong it may be unrealized, may indicate the\nhighest type of morality. Is race integrity\nsuch a moral desideratum? Most certainly\nit is not. If it were, then every offspring\nof race mingling carries in himself the evidence\nof moral guilt, no matter how noble\nthe morality of his living. But this is a doctrine\nwhich few, probably, will wish to assert.\nIt would be, in effect, to announce a\nnew doctrine of inborn depravity, and to\nhang a millstone about the neck of humanity\nthat it might be drowned in the depths of", "119", 81, 81, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00223", "some of them may have checks\nin them.

We may be sure, however, that\nthe President does this unwittingly and because\non this Negro question he sees as\nthrough a glass darkly.\nIt is significant that in the discussion of\nlynching and education for Negroes that the\nPresident appeals merely to sentiment and\nhas no recommendation to congress; nor does\nhe say what he will do himself in these matters.\nOf course both questions under our system\nof government belong to the states.  So,\nin a large measure, does the question of the\nJapanese in the California schools.  One cannot\nbut admire the President's fine impetuosity\nin asserting that no power at his command\nwill be left unused to give the Japanese all\ntheir rights; while one, at the same time,\nmust wonder at the exercise of self control\nthat he shows on the Negro question.  The \nPresident, while asking for an enlargement of\npowers, might have recommended that the \n\nconstitution be so amended as to give the\nfederal government power to punish lynchers.\nHe certainly could, with some show of remaining\nwithin constitutional limits, have asked\nthat, under the general welfare clause, this\nrich and prosperous government turn over to\nthe states in proportion to their illiteracy a \nnumber of millions of dollars; requiring of\nthe states only that the money be distributed\nimpartially to the illiterates within their respective\nborders.\nMore significant yet than the President's\nfailure to do anything other than lecture on\nlynching and education, was his silence on\nthe subject on which (if there are any morals\nin politics) he was morally bound to speak;\na subject, moreover, upon which he could\nhave made a recommendation to Congress\nwithout asking them to break the shell of\nthe constitution whereby he and they are so\nclosely cabined.  The last platform of the \nrepublican party upon which Mr. Roosevelt\nran without dissent pledged the party and its\ncandidate to look into the suppression of\nNegro Suffrage in the South.  On this question \nthe President remained strangely silent;\nthough it must have been known to him that\nat each general election the constitution is\ncontravened by certain state laws and the administration\nthereof.  Senator Tillman not\nlong since in Chicago, gloatingly and gratuitously\ntold how intelligent Negroes are kept\nfrom voting, while at the same time, ignorant\nwhite men are allowed that privilege.\nOne should not despair, however; one cannot\ntell what the future will bring.  The\nPresident seems to like surprises-even sensations.\nSome day before March, 1909, the\nPresident may suddenly take a notion that the\ntime is ripe to do justice on this suffrage question\nand may send a special message to congress\nurging immediate constitutional action.\nBut let Negroes above all things hope and\npray that he will not send this message until\nhe has full information on the subject and\nthat evil guides and advisers may not lead him\nfrom the path of truth and justice.\n\n\nHelp Solve The Problem\n\nIn these days of riots and lynchings, of lectures\nand press discussions of the subject one is liable to\nbecome nauseated with the \"race problem.\"  I, like\neveryone else, am sick of the agitation as such but\nbitter as is the medicine it must be administered in\never increasing doses until it begins its wholesome\nwork of correcting the abuses complained of.  I\nthink the trouble lies in too much discussion and\ntoo little work at solving the so-called problem-too\nmuch of diagnosis and not enough of remedy.\nTake the phrase of the subject which I have chosen\nfor this article.  It has been so thoroughly discussed\nfrom one end to the other of this broad land that it\nis needless for me to discuss it here, and yet no\none, so far as I know, has offered a remedy.  Everyone\nis agreed that if the two races understood each \nother better they would get along better together\nand especially that if the whites could learn as\nmuch about our many great men, our progressive\ninstitutions and forward movements as they learn\nthrough the daily press about our few brutes and\ncriminals, they would be compelled to modify their\nopinion that \"all niggers are bad.\"  Yet no one\nhad undertaken to show the whites our better side\nor to help the two races to a better understanding\nof each other.  It is not only an injustice but an\noutrage, that while in the nature of things the daily\npapers must need publish all our misdeeds, they \ndeliberately overlook every event with an upward\ntendency among our people.  To illustrate I will\ntake the case of a local church.  About two years\nago this church was rent asunder by the action of\nits old pastor, who, instead of accepting the new\ncharge to which he was appointed by the bishop,\ncontended that undue influence was used in his\nremoval, and refused to make way for the new\npastor.  Part of the congregation and some of the\nofficer's supported him and the others remained loyal\nto the conference.  Charges and counter-charges\nwere bandied between the two factions, of graft\nand other scandals, until the fight reached the\ncourts, and finally the deposed pastor took his supporters\nand founded an independent church.  A\nPittsburg newspaper took the matter up and had a \nreporter at every important meeting.  But since\nthen both churches have grown wonderfully and\nare now engaged in building new structures.  The\nold church-which is, by the way, the oldest west of\nthe Alleghenies among our people,-having out-\n\ngrown its old edifice, is now building a larger and\nfiner one on the same site, and making such marvellous\nprogress on the work as to win the admiration\nof all who see it.  Several weeks ago, in the\npresence of about eight thousand people, with the\nbishop officiating, this congregation laid the corner\nstone of its new edifice and never a word was said\nof it in one Pittsburg paper, after all that had been\npublished about their unfortunate strife.\nCan't we find a remedy for such conditions?\nCan't we have a volunteer \"press agent\" in every\ncity and community of the land?  White people\nas a rule don't read our own magazines and newspapers\nso we must get at them through the same\nchannel which has given them a bad opinion of us.\nSelect the most influential newspaper in your community\nas I have done in Pittsburg.  Write, or\nbetter, call upon the editor and show him the injustice\nthe newspapers are doing us daily, at the\nsame time offering your service in reporting all\nevents of interest among your people, and paying-\nif you feel like it-a year's subscription for him to\nsome strong magazine like the VOICE.  Try to\nget him to say something editorially in his paper\nabout the injustice being done us by the newspapers.\nIt is my experience that the whites wont\nread a regular race column in any newspaper, so\ntry to have your articles published as ordinary \nnews and that it may carry the desired force ask\nthe editor to let it appear as something undertaken\nby the paper itself instead of publishing your\nname.  After you have done this and anything\nelse which may suggest itself, send your name and\naddress to the editor of the VOICE, who has\npromised to publish each month a list of such names\nif the plan works.  By doing this we can all know\nof each other and exchange ideas and reports of\nany event likely to be of national interest.  Don't\nbe discouraged if refused by one paper, but try\nanother until you shall have tried all within your\nreach.

BENTLEY\n\"-Wise books-as much as possible good books.\"\n\nAn excellent Christmas story by Harry\nStillwell Edwards, in the December Century,\nis concerning a Negro convict who, through\nthe intercession of three little white girls, was\nliberated on Christmas morning.  The story\nis drawn on conventional Christmas lines-\nsuffering, sorrow, on the Great Birthday, relieved\nand comforted by that love and good \nwill which we mortals seem to keep so successfully\nin check during the rest of the year.\nOne reads and feels that pleasant sense of\nreflected goodness which stories of this kind\nsometimes provoke, and in our gladness that\npoor \"Shadow\" was made free at last, we\ntrust ourselves to read again the picture of\nhim lying awake on Christmas Eve in the log\nbarracks.  \"That which kept the boy awake\nwas necessarily something novel.  It was not\npain.  Had he not felt the lash and the \ncrush of falling coal?  Nor sorrow! for behind \nhim among the far away Georgian hills\nwas a certain cabin about which as a child he\nhad played, as all children play, and the sad,\nundying memory of it shut out all other\nsorrows.  Nor was it a mere yearning for\nfreedom, that had long since given place to a \ndull unlifting despair.  All these -sorrow,\npain and despair-had been the companions\nof his solitude in many a night of gloom,\nkeeping watch as he slept.  The strange new\ncompanion of his solitude, from whose divine\npresence this night all others withdrew,\nwas Hope.\"\nWe breathe a sigh of relief that hope was\nrealized and that this boy, imprisoned when\na mere child for a crime, \"an error of ignorance\nand lack of moral training,\" was at last\n\nable to leave that life which \"for him had\nbeen fierce and full of agony.\"\nWhile still complacent over the happy ending\nof the Christmas story, take up a recent\nbook \"Undistinguished Americans,\" edited by\nHamilton Holt of the \"Independent,\" and\nturn to the chapter \"The Life Story of a \nNegro Peon.\"\nThere you confront a real \"Shadow\" from\nwhose life tragedy, Hope is forever excluded\nand the horrid impress of whose dread environment\nit will take many, many birthdays\nto obliterate.  The story, told in the words\nof the convict, is a most terrible human document,\nshowing as it does how in the very\nmidst of our boasted civilization, men for\ngreed, will main the spirit and torture the\nbodies of fellow human beings-how a great\nstate manufactures criminals and then uses its\nvictims to increase its revenues.\nA little orphan Negro, who never knew\nwho his father was, is bound out to work by\nhis uncle, who draws the pay.  When the boy\nreaches manhood he leaves the place and hires\nhimself independently to a neighboring farmer.\nThat night he is caught, brought back to his\nhome and given thirty lashed with a buggy\nwhip over his bare shoulders, after that he\nwas kept on the place night and day.  \"I\nwas a man nearly grown before I knew how\nto count from one to one hundred,\" he says.\n\"I was nearly grown before I ever saw a colored\nschool-teacher.

And I stayed.  I signed a contract\n-that is, I made my mark-for one year.\nThe captain was to give me $3.50 a week and\nfurnish me a little house on the plantation-a\none-room log cabin similar to those used by\nhis other laborers.\"\nThen he married Mandy, who had been\nhouse-servant up at the \"big house\" and went\nto house keeping in a little two-room shanty.\nOne likes to pause here in the simple narrative\nand contemplate the short span of life's\nhappiness that came to this poor unfortunate.\nWith Mandy in his little cabin he thought\nhimsely \"the biggest man in Georgia,\" and\nwhen the little son came these two people rejoiced\nin their home building and in laying\nthe foundation of that family life, which is\nso precious to the Negro in spite of all the\nuntoward circumstances which have conspired\nto crush it out.\nIn the meantime the captain died and his\nson, who had become a senator, assumed control.\nAt the end of the fifth year the senator\nsuggested that he sign a contract for ten\nyears, to do away with the bother of fixing\npapers every year.  He consulted with his\nwife and as things were going so happily,\nshe consented and he signed the contract and\nin doing so signed away his happiness, his home\nand all things that manhood holds most dear\n-as the sequel shows.  But hear it in his\nwords:\n\"Not long afterwards the senator had a \nlong low shanty built on his place.  A great\nbig chimney, with a wide open fire-place, was\nbuilt at one end of it, and on each side of the \nhouse, running lengthwise, there was a row\nof frames or stalls just large enough to hold\na single mattress.  The places for these mattresses\nwere fixed one above the other; so\nthat there was a double row of these stalls\nor pens on each side.  They looked for all \n\nthe world like stalls for horses.  Since then\nI have seen cabooses similarly arranged as\nsleeping quarters for railroad laborers.  Nobody\nseemed to know what the senator was\nfixing for.  All doubts were put aside one\nbright day in April when about forty able-bodied\nNegroes, bound in iron chains, and\nsome of them hand cuffed, were brought out\nto the senator's farm in three big wagons. \nThey were quartered in a long low shanty,\nand it was afterward called the Stockade.\nThis was the beginning of the senator's convict\ncamp.  These men were prisoners who\nhad been leased by the senator from the state\nof Georgia at about $200 each per year, the\nstate agreeing to pay for guards and physicians,\nfor necessary inspection, for inquests,\nall rewards for escaped convicts, the cost of\nlitigation and all other incidental camp expenses.\nWhen I saw these men in shackles,\nand the guards with their guns, I was scared\nnearly to death.  I felt like running away, but\nI didn't know where to go.  And if there had\nbeen any place to go to, I would have had to\nleave my wife and child behind.\"\nAll the free laborers wanted to quit and\nthen they found out that in the contracts\nwhich they had in their ignorance, signed,\nthey had agreed to be locked  in the \nstockade day or night as their employer saw\nfit; that they could not leave and go elsewhere\nwithout the consent of their employers;\nthat if they ran away they could be run down\nby blood-hounds, arrested without process of\nlaw, returned to their employers, who, according\nto contract, might brutally beat them\nor administer any other kind of punishment.\nIn fact they had sold themselves into slavery.\n\"And what could we do about it?\" the\npoor fellow miserably asks, \"the white folks\nhad all the courts, all the guns, all the hounds; \nall the railroads, all the telegraph wires, all\nthe newspapers, all the money, and nearly all\nthe land- and we had only our ignorance,\nour poverty and our empty hands.\"  So every\none of them went back and worked by those\nconvicts for ten years.  Soon the senator, who\nwas flourishing like the bay tree (or the upas\nplant) in his worldly affairs, buying a thousand\nmore acres, building new saw mills and\nsuch-built other stockades and among the \nnew convicts sent down were several women.\nWithin two years he had 200 Negroes working\non his plantation, half free (!) laborers\nand half convicts. \n", "125", 77, 77, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00307", "KERNELS AND KEYNOTES\nYule-Song:  A Memory\nBy WILLIAM STANLELY BRAITHWAITE\nFrom \"Lyrics of Life and Love\"\n\nDecember comes, snows come,\nComes the wintry weather;\nFaces from away come-\nHearts must be together.\nDown the stair-steps of the hours\nYule leaps the hills and towers-\nFill the bowl and hang the holly,\nLet the times be jolly.\n\nDay comes, and night comes\nAnd the guests assemble-\nOnce again the old dream comes\nThat I would dissemble,\nFalls a shadow 'cross the floor,\nSeen!-and is seen no more.\nO that memory would forego\nThe hanging of the mistletoe.\n\nOn Women\nBy MAURICE MAETERLINCK\nFrom \"The Treasure of The Humble.\"\n\nIn these domains also are the laws unknown.\nFar above our heads, in the very centre of the sky,\nshines the star of our destined love; and it is in the\natmosphere of that star, and illumined by its rays,\nthat every passion that stirs us will come to life,\neven to the end.  And though we choose to right\nor to left of us, on the heights or in the shallows;\nthough, in our struggle to break through the enchanted\ncircle that is drawn around all the acts\nof our life, we do violence to the instinct that\nmoves us, and try our hardest to choose against\nthe choice of destiny, yet shall the women we elect\nalways have come to us straight from the unvarying\nstar.  And if, like Don Juan, we take a thousand\nand three to our embraces, still shall we find,\non that evening when arms fall asunder and lips\ndisunite, that it is always the same women, good or\nbad, tender or cruel, loving or faithless, that is\nstanding before us.\nFor indeed we can never emerge from a little\ncircle of light that destiny traces about our footsteps;\nand one might almost believe that the extent\nand the hue of this impassable ring are known\neven to the men who are furthest from us.  It is the\ntinge of its spiritual rays that they perceive first\nof all, and therefore will it come about that they\nwill either smilingly bold out their hand to us or\ndraw it back in fear. . . . \nThe kingdom of love is, before all else, the great \n\nkingdom of certitude, for it is within its bounds\nthat the soul is possessed of the utmost leisure.\nThere, truly, they have naught to do but to recognize\neach other, offer deepest admiration, and\nask their questions-tearfully, like the maid who\nhas found the sister she had lost-while, far away\nfrom them, arm links itself in arm and breaths are\nmingling. . . . At last has a moment come when\nthey can smile and live their own life-for a truce\nhas been called in the stern routine of daily existence\n-and it is perhaps from the heights of this\nsmile and these ineffable glances that springs the\nmysterious perfume that pervades love's dreariest\nmoments, that preserves forever the memory of the\ntime when the lips first met. . . .\nOf the true, predestines love alone, do I speak\nhere.  When Fate sends forth the woman it has\nchosen for us-sends her forth from the fastness\nof the great spiritual cities in which we, all unconsciously,\ndwell, and she awaits us at the crossing\nof the road we have to traverse when the hour\nis come-we are warned at the first glance.  Some\nthere are who attempt to force the hand of Fate.\nWildly pressing down their eyelids, so as not to\nsee that which had to be seen-struggling with all\ntheir puny strength against the eternal forces-they\nwill contrive perhaps to cross the road and go towards\nanother, sent thither but not for them.  But,\nstrive as they may, they will not succeed in 'stir-\n\n\nTHE VOICE     587\n\nring up the dead waters that lie in the great tarn\nof the future.'  Nothing will happen: the pure force\nwill not descend from the heights, and those wasted\nhours and kisses will never become part of the real\nhours and kisses of their life. . . .\nThere are times when destiny shuts her eyes, but\nshe knows full well that, when evening falls, we\nshall return to her, and that the last word must be\nhers.  She may shut her eyes, but the time till she\nre-open them is time that is lost. . . .\nIt would seem that women are more largely\nswayed by destiny than ourselves.  They submit\nto its decrees with far more simplicity; nor is there\nsincerety in the resistance they offer.  They are still\nnearer to God, and yield themselves with less reserve\nto the pure workings of the mystery.  And\ntherefore is it, doubtless, that all the incidents in\nour life in which they take part seem to bring us\nnearer to what might almost be the very fountainhead\nof destiny.  It is above all when by their\nside that moments come, unexpectedly, when a\n'clear presentiment' flashes across us, a presentiment\nof a life that does not always parallel to the life\nwe know of.  They lead us close to the gates of our\nbeing.  May it not be during one of those profound\nmoments, when his head is pillowed on a woman's\nbreast, that the hero learns to know the strength\nand steadfastness of his star?  And indeed will\nany true sentiment of the future ever come to the\nman who has not had his resting place in a\nwomen's heart?\nYet again do we enter the troubled circles of\nthe higher conscience.  Ah! how true it is that, here,\ntoo, 'the so-called psychology is a hobgoblin that\nhas usurped, in the sanctuary itself, the place reserved\nfor the veritable images of the gods.'  For\nit is not always the surface that always concerns\nus-nay, nor is it the deepest of hidden thoughts.\nDo you imagine that love knows only of thoughts,\nand acts, and words, and that the soul never\nemerges from its dungeon?  Do I need to be told\nwhether she whom I take in my arms today ois\njealous or faithful, gay or sad, sincere or treacherous?\nDo you think that these wretched words can\nattain the heights whereon our souls repose and\nwhere our destiny fulfills itself in silence?  What\ncare I whether she speak of rain or jewels, of pins \n\nor feathers; what care I though she appear not to\nunderstand?  Do you think that it is for a sublime\nword I thirst when I feel that a soul is gazing\ninto my soul?  Do I not know that the most beautiful\nof thoughts dare not raise their heads when\nthe mysteries confront them?  I am ever standing\nat the sea-shore; and, were I Plato, Pascal, or\nMichael Angelo, and the woman I loved merely\ntelling me of her ear rings, the words I would say\nwould appear but the same as they floated on the\nwaves of the fathomless inner sea, that each of us\nwould be contemplating in the other.  Let but my\nvery loftiest thought be weighed in the scale of\nlove, it will not turn the balance against the three\nlittle words that the maid who loves me shall have\nwhispers of her silver bangles, her pearl necklace,\nor her trinkets of glass. . . .\nIt is we who do not understand, for that we\nnever rise above the earth-level of our intellect.\nLet us but ascend to the first snows of the mountain,\nand all inequalities are levelled by the purifying\nhand of the horizon that opens before us.  What\ndifference then between a pronouncement of Marcus\nAurelius and the words of the child complaining\nof the cold? Let us be humble, and learn to distinguish\nbetween accident and essence.  Let not\n'sticks that float' cause us to forget the progidies\nof the gulf.  The most glorious thoughts and the\nmost degraded ideas can no more ruffle the eternal\nsurface of our soul than, amidst the stars of\nHeaven, Himalaya or precipice can alter the surface\nof the earth.  A look, a kiss, and the certainty\nof a great invisible presence: all is said; and\nI know that she who is by my side is my equal.\n. . . Some of Nature's strangest secrets are often\nrevealed, at sacred momets to these maidens who\nlove, and ingenuously and unconsciously will they\ndeclare them.  The sage follows in their footsteps\nto gather up the jewels, that in their innocence\nand joy they scatter along the path.  The poet, who\nfeels what they feel, offers homage to their love,\nthat is the germ of the age of gold, to other times\nand other countries.'

She had been living happily near \nLondon with a devoted hand and several children for years. Would such \nan existence appeal to me? i was perfectly sure it would not. I knew I \nwould be much happier trying to promote the welfare of my race in my native \nland working under certain hard conditions, than I would be living in a \nforeign land where I could enjoy freedom from prejudice, but where I would \nmake no effort to do the work which I believed it was my duty to do. I \ndoubted that I could respect myself, if I shirked my responsibility and were \nrecreant to my trust. After mature deliberation I decided then and there \nthat I would be much happier living in the United States of America than \nI could be anywhere else on earth, so I was glad when the steamer began to \nplough the sea to bring me home. \n\n97 \nChapter 14 \nI Return to the United States. \n\nAfter I landed in new York, I spent a few days with Mother and \nthen we both went to Marietta, Ohio, where my brother, Thomas Ayers Church, \nhad been attending college and was about to graduate. from the Commencement \nexercises Mother and Brother returned to New York and I proceeded to \nMemphis. But trying to get there was a thrilling experience sure enough. \n\nIn purchasing my ticket from Marietta to Memphis I explained \nthat I wanted a through sleeper, and the agent sold me both the railroad\nticket and the Pullman. I left Marietta at night and when I asked the \nporter to make up my berth after he had finished with several others, he \nsaid it would hardly be worth while for me to go to bed, because I would \nhave to get off at Louisville, Kentucky, at midnight and wait till the next \nmorning for the train to Memphis. I was very much surprised and agitated \nand insisted that I be allowed to remain on that sleeper, since my Pullman \nticket entitled me to a berth from Marietta, Ohio, to Memphis, Tennessee. I \nwas all the more wrought up, because I suspected that I was being ejected \nfrom the Pullman car on account of my race. I was well aware that it was \nmost difficult for colored people to get reservations anywhere in the\nSouth. Several of my personal friends had been ejected a short while previous \nto this incident, and one had been seriously injured by a mob which had pulled\nhim off the train. So I felt that my own doom had come. \n\nThen the conductor was called and he frankly admitted that my \nPullman ticket did entitle me to a berth from Marietta to Memphis, but \nthat the agent had sold me a Pullman ticket over one road and the railroad \nticket over another. There was nothing for me to do, therefore, but \nget off at Louisville, remain there all night and take the train for \nMemphis over the route which my railroad ticket called for. If I did not \ncare to do that, he said, I would have to buy another railroad ticket from \nLouisville to Memphis over the road on which my Pullman ticket had been \nsold. I was in great distress. I knew I could secure accommodations\nat a hotel in Louisville. I did not care to ask anybody to take me in at \nmidnight. It was before telephones could be conveniently used in such an \nemergency. I greatly preferred to buy another railroad ticket, so that I \nmight continue my journey in my Pullman berth for which I had already \npaid. But I had brought only ten dollars with me, and that was not enough \nto get a railroad ticket from Louisville to Memphis. Hearing the conductor \nexplain the situation to me several passengers came over to my berth to see     \n     \n \n      \n      ", "26", 150, 150, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-021:00539", "-3- \n\nThe next morning, I told my attorney, Mr. Anderson, the whole \nstory. I emphasized the fact that I would never have remained in the \nwaiting room nearly an hour, if I had not feared Howard West would forcibly \ndetain me, if I tried to escape, or if that did not happen that I \nwould be arrested on the public streets, and followed to the jail by a \ncrowd of men and boys. \n\nWhile I was stating the facts to my attorney, a man who was evidently \nlistening to me in the front room came in and said, \"Howard West \ntold somebody that he did not really call the police the first time he phoned\".\nWhether that is true or not, I can not say. I do know however, that he \ntold me to make my seat that the police would be here in a few minutes, \nevery time I asked him how long I would have to wait to be arrested. I \nshould never have remained in the waiting room one second, if I had not \nfelt sure Howard West had really telephoned to the police. For when he \nthreatened me with arrest in less than three minutes after he had seen me \nfor the first time, he suited the action to the word by removing the receiver \nand talking into the telephone. I did not suspect he was only \nhoaxing. \n\n----Mary Church Terrell's repudiation of the charges preferred----\n--------------------against her by Howard West.--------------------\n\nEach and every one of the charges made by Howard West, in his \nofficial report to the railroad company, is false. I did not act in \na 'very disorderly manner before the ticket window.' He was the only disorderly\nperson there. He stormed and raged at me in the most insulting \nand outrageous manner. I did not interfere in any way, shape, or form \nwith business and passenger traffic at the ticket office. When I entered \nthe waiting room, nobody was at the ticket window. The next train did \nnot leave for an hour. Only one women came up to the ticket window to \npurchase a ticket while I was there. \n\nThe younger of the two men said, \"move away from the window, \nthat lady wants to get a ticket\". As soon as I saw the lady I moved \naside saying to the young man, \"you talk to me like a gentleman, I will \nbe glad to comply with your request\". It is difficult for me to believe \nthat young man would tell a deliberate falsehood in order to convict \na colored woman on a charge of which he knows she is not guilty. \n\nI did not annoy and disturb passengers waiting in the public waiting \nroom with loud and abusive language. I have never disturbed or annoyed \npeople any where in the world. I have gone to Europe three times; \nI studied abroad three years; I have travelled all over the South many \ntimes; have spoken in every State in that section, and have never had \nany trouble any where in life, till I came to Dover, Del. October 13th. \n\nI have never used loud and abusive language any where in my life, \nand nobody but Howard West has ever accused me of doing so. I did not \nrefuse to leave the ticket window when *requested* to do so by this person \nin charge. In the first place, the said person in charge did not \n*request* me to leave the window. He stormed at me savagely, and ordered \nme in the most insulting and abusive manner; saying, \"get away from \n \n-4-\n\nthat window. Take your seat; the police officer will be here soon. \nYou know you are disorderly\", Howard spat out at me. \"No, I am not \ndisorderly, I replied, I had no idea I would give offence by asking \nyou a civil question, and I did not intend to offend you at all\". \nI did not make myself a public nuisance at Dover as I am charged. I \nhave never made myself a public, or private nuisance anywhere in the \nworld. \n\nI did not disregard requests. Only one request was made of \nme by the younger of the two men who stood at the window. I complied \nwith this request instantly, and I can not believe that young man \nwould deny that I did. I did not defy any orders, for when Howard \nWest ordered me in the most insulting manner imaginable to take my \nseat, threatening that the police officer would soon arrive to arrest \nme, I took my seat and waited quietly for about fifteen minutes for\nthe officer to arrive. If I had refused to remain in the waiting \nroom when I was told I had been placed under arrest, Howard West \nmight claim I had defied his orders. But since I remained in the \nwaiting room for nearly an hour because he ordered me to do so, he \ncan not truthfully say that I defied his orders. However, there is \njust as much truth in this charge as there is in the others. \n\nI did not give an exhibition of any emotional abuse and disrespect \nby shaking my fist as Howard West and his clerk through the \noffice window, I did not say that I would tell General Du Pont \nhow I was being treated, but I did say that:\n\n\"A gentleman like General Du Pont would be shocked to know \nthat a colored woman was being treated so brutally in his State.\"\n\nI did not say that Howard West was a \"low down coward\". I \nhave never called any body a \"low-down\" anything in my life. When \nhe told me three minutes after he had seen me for the first, I was \nto be arrested, I did say that nobody but a coward would treat a \nwoman like that. I am of the same opinion now. If I said he did \nnot know how to treat people, as charged, I spoke the truth. \n\nHoward West says that one passenger, an attorney-at-law, expressed \nthe opinion that \"this woman should be arrested for disorderly \nconduct\". There would not be enough jails in Delaware to confine \nthe citizens of that State, if people who violated the law no \nmore than I did were arrested every time an ill-tempered, violent \nman like Howard West chose to prefer the charge of \"disorderly conduct\"\nagainst them, because they asked him a question and then expressed \nsurprise that he flew into a tempestuous rage at them for so \ndoing. \n\nI did absolutely nothing for which I should be arrested for \ndisorderly conduct. When I think of the provocation to lose my\nself control, I wonder now how I was able to preserve it. It is \nabsurd for Howard West to claim that I took exception to his failure \nto suspend business to look up a telephone number for me. It would \nnever occur to me to prefer such a request to a man who as a public \nservant was attending to business for which he was paid. \n\nHe stormed at me when he told me to look into the telephone \ndirectory, he did not \"direct\" me to do so, as he claims.

He knows, I \ncalled for information, for, during most of the time I was in the \ntelephone booth asking information to give me Mr. Raikes number, \nHoward West stood in front of the door glaring at me as though he\nintended to strike me.  I was greatly relieved that he did not do me\nbodily harm.\n\n     The only \"further abuse\" of which I was guilty, and the only\n\"un complimentary opinions as to what I thought of those in office\" consisted\nin asking how long I had to wait to be arrested, what I had \ndone to be sto  rmed  at, and stating that I had never been so shamefully\ntreated by any human being in my life before, although I had \nbeen to Europe three times, had travelled and spoken in every state \nof the South more than once.\n\n     The only true statement made by Howard West is when he says\n\"she was ordered three or four times to leave the ticket window.\" I\nstayed at the window only long enough to ask how long it would be before \nthe officer would come to arrest me, and hear West command me to \nleave the window, and take my seat till the police officer arrived.\nI never once refused to leave the window.  If I had really refused \nto leave, I verily believe West would have come out to the waiting\nroom and thrown me away, so furious and angry had he become.\n\n     Howard West makes a misleading statement, and gives the wrong\nimpression by leaving those who read his charges to inferthat he\ndid not call up the police department till I had refused to leave the\nwindow three or four times when ordered to do so, saying that no one\ncould make me leave.\n\n     As I have already stated, a man who heard me relate what\noccurred in the waiting room told me Thursday morning that Howard West\nclaimed he did not call the policeman, when he went for the first time \nto the telephone and made me believe he was carrying out his threat\nto have me arrested.  He says, \"I then went to the telephone and \nasked for the police department.\"  She heard me asking, and said,\"\n\"that's right send for a policeman, I want to be arrested\", and repeatedly \nannoyed the office and those in the waiting room by returning \nto the ticket window and asking how long it would be before the\npoliceman arrived as she wanted to be arrested.\"\n\n     Since I had seen Howard West take down the receiver, and talk\ninto the telephone after he had threatened to call the police, I was \ncertain he had done so.  Fearing that he would use violence to detain\nme, if I attempted to leave the station, or that if he did not do\nthat, I would be arrested on the public street and followed to the\njail by a crowd of men and boys, I decided to remain the in the station \ntill the officer arrived.   There was nothing for me to do but return\nto the ticket window and ask how long it would be before the policeman\nwould arrive.\n\n     Howard West had phoned for a policeman twice.  It was, therefore,\nquite natural that I should want to get over the ordeal and be\narrested as soon as possible, and I did say \"I wanted to be arrested as soon \nas possible for I was suffering mental anguish during that\nterrible suspense.\n\n                                           Mary Church Terrell\n\n\n\n-6-\n                                                 Remarks made by \n                                          Mary Church Terrell on the\n                                                      Dover Affair.\n\n     I had to choose between gaining an unpleasant notoriety, or \nmaintaining myself respect.  I chose to maintain myself respect, however \nserious the consequences might be.  Howard West made an attack \nupon me, not as an individual, so much as the thing which I represented.  \nHe stormed, raged at me, and threatened me with arrest, because \nI represent everything which he probably scorned and detests most.\n\n     When I asked him to give me some information at the ticket \nwindow, he saw standing before him the representative of a race which \nhe probably would like to see in slavery today, and he is determined to \nkeep in its place so far as in him lies.  He saw before him a woman \nof that race who was using the English language correctly, and whom \nhe had advertised to speak to colored people on the political issues of \n  the day.  He knew I had come especially to urge colored women to \nregister and vote the Republican ticket, the very sight of me raged \nhim.  He lost control of himself completely.  He saw he had a good \nchance to wound my feelings and insult me, and he availed himself of \nit to the very last degree.\n\n    I have travelled all over the South, have been through all the \nSouthern States many times, have spoken in every one of them, and I \nhave delivered few addresses to audiences in the South in which no \nwhite people were present.  I have never failed to express my opinion \nas forcibly and as clearly on the race problem as I possibly could, but \nI have always done so as tactfully, and as politely as a woman discussing \nthis delicate problem should do without stirring up strife and doing \nmore harm than good.  Some of the finest letters of recommendation I \nhav e that have been given me by leading Southern White people who volunteered \nto commend both the matter presented, and the manner in which \nit was given.\n\n     First, I regretted the whole occurrence exceedingly, but now I \nrejoice that I had the presence of mind and courage to do the only \nthing which a woman with my selfrespect sould have done.  I would \nrather have gone to jail that to have stood silently by and allowed \nHoward West to storm and rail at me simply because I had asked him t \npolitely for some information without resenting it.\n\n     For many years I have tried to promote the welfare of my race \nin every way I could.  But, I have never done anything which I believe \ndid more to compass that end than when I resented the insulting \nmanner in which Howard West stormed and raged at me.  I have never \nbeen the victim of unpleasnat notoriety before. It sometimes happens \nthat a woman has to decide to do her duty, to live up to her highest \nideals even if she knows that by so doing she may be the victim of unpleansat \nnotoriety herself and bring grief to those who love her best.\nI would rather be the target of the cci ticism of those who comdemn me \nfor resenting the insult no only to myself, but through me to the womanhood \nof the whole race, that to lose my self-respect, because I was too \ncowardly in a crisis to do what I know to be right.", "4", 151, 151, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00301", "301\nBefore they left that Amernis Conference, however, \"They had arrived\nat virtual unanimity of opinion in regard to certain principles,\"\nas the resolution expressed it.

If this woman were as remarkable\nas people claimed she was, said my friend, she might be able to locate\nher cape. In the spirit of fun, rather than because we expected to\nget the desired information, we sallied forth on a lark to this medium\none day. My friend went into the presence first and then I took\nmy turn. \n\"Your name is Mary,\" said the medium as soon as she saw me.\n\"And there are three little spirits flying around your head. Look\nover there,\" she continued, pointing to my right, \"There is a spirit\nnear you who is angry with you. He committed suicide on account of\nsomething you did to him. Then, there is another spirit near you --\nshe is a member of your family and her name is Emmeline.\"\nRight there I stopped her, stating positively that no member of\nmy family had ever borne that name. But the medium paid no attention \nwhatever to this contradiction of her statement. She insisted that\nthe spirit she saw near me was a relative and that her name was\nEmmeline. \"Perhaps you have never met her in the flesh,\" she explained, \n\"but there she stands just the same.\"\nWhen the medium stated as soon as I entered the room, that she\nsaw three little spirits flying around my head, I remembered, of\ncourse that I had lost three babies in five years practically at\nbirth. When she referred to the spirit who was angry with me and\nhad committed suicide on my account I laughed at her and assured her\nthat nothing like that had ever occurred in my life. But she insisted \nthat she knew what she was talking about and my denials\ndid not move her an inch. She saw this angry spirit standing\nright there in the room, she declared, and what her spiritual eyes\nsaw, she was bound to believe. \nAfter leaving the medium I thought of a man who had once loved me", "2", 152, 152, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-021:00533", "Campaign Speech made at Newport, R. I.   October 12, 1920. \n\nIt is extremely difficult for me to make a campaign \nspeech to an audience composed of colored people. As a rule \nwhen I speak, I try to do one of two things; either, to enlighten\npeople about the things they do not know, or, to convert\nthem from what I think is a wrong point of view to a \nright. I can do neither one of these things to an audience \nlike this for you all know as much as I do about the two great \nparties in the United States, so far as their attitude toward \ncolored people is concerned. \n\nNo matter how ignorant a colored man is, he has sense \nenough to know that the Republican Party is the only one that \nhas ever done anything for his Race, and that the Democratic \nParty has not helped him one single, solitary bit. And, if \nthere is a colored man in this audience who is really a Democrat \nat heart, I would not know what to say, or how to say it, \nwhere to start, or where to end, to convert such a rare bird. \n\nLet us examine the record of the Democratic Party, and \nsee just what it has done. Do you ever read the newspapers \nin this section? Frederick Douglass said, \"if you want to \nkeep anything from colored people, put it in the newspapers\". \nWell, if you do not read the newspapers, do you ever talk to \ncolored people who come from that section where Democrats are \nas thick as bees in a hive, and where they sting colored people \nevery time they fly? \n\nIf you read the newspapers and talk with colored people \nwho come from a certain large section[s] [of] in this Country you will \nknow there are thousands of colored men who are intelligent, \nand well-to-do, but who would take their lives in their hands \nif they dared to cast a ballot, where there are thousands of \nmen of other races, some of whom are ignorant, vicious, and \ndegraded, but who are practically forced to vote. Jog your \nmemory and see which of the two parties is responsible for a \ncondition like that. \n\nAt the close of the War, if an Abolitionist or an \nUnion soldier had been told that in less than forty years \nmuch of the work which it cost millions of treasure, and rivers\nof blood to accomplish, would be practically undone in\nevery one of the States where the Democratic Party is strongest,\nhe would have dismissed such a statement as [to] too wildly,\ncrazy and improbable to discuss; and, this is precisely \nwhat has happened. \n\nConstitutional Amendments which conferred the elective \nfranchise upon colored men are practically a dead letter in \nevery State where Democrats have control. Call attention to \nthe illegal political practices and you are accused of waving \nthe bloody shirt, nothing can be more criminal. Public wrath \nwhere Democrats have control is no longer turning against the \nsinner but against him who dares to call the sinner to account. \n\nIs there any colored man in this audience who finds it \nin his heart to vote for this Party that has taken the right of", "2", 152, 152, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-021:00535", "composed of men who had murder in \ntheir hearts & no mercy in their souls\n\n\n\n-3-\n\nIn the Democratic Strong-hold where 133 electoral votes\nwill be gathered up, put on a silver plate, and handed to Mr.\nCox for his breakfast; it is absolutely impossible for the colored\nman to get justice in the courts of law.\n\nIn that section where a white Republican is as scarce\nas hen's teeth, the iniquitous \"convict lease system\" flourishes.\nI have discovered in referring to it in private conversation,\nand public addresses delivered in the North, very few up here\namong either white or colored people know anything about that\ndiabolitical system at all.\n\n Under the regime of the \"convict lease system\" [all] colored\nmen, women and children are thrown in to dark, damp, diseased\ncells not much larger than a good sized grave. They are\noverworked, under fed, and only partially covered with vermin\ninfested rags. Hundreds of children are born to the colored\nwomen in these camps, and breathe the polluted atmosphere of\nthese dens of vice and woe from the moment they utter their first\ncry into the world until they are released from its horrors by\ndeath.\n\nIn that section where a Republican is indeed a rare\nbird, colored people are victims of the \"convict labor system\".\nDid you ever hear of that? Colored people who work day in\nand day out are deliberately and systematically robbed of their\nearnings. There are colored men this moment in the rural sections\nof the South who are still working to pay off a debt of\na few dollars which they borrowed eight or ten years ago from\nthe white man for whom they are still working and on whose\nland they are still living today. So accustomed are colored\npeople to be cheated in this way that they have composed a little\nrhyme which runs like this:- \"naught's a naught, and a figger is\na figger; all for the white man, but none for the nigger\".\n\nIn that section where the Democratic Party is strongest,\nit is almost impossible for colored men to protect the women of\nhis family from the attentions and insults of any white man who\nmay set his baleful eyes upon her.  Many a colored man who has\nbeen lynched has been put to death because he has tried to protect\nsome woman in his family from the lustful attentions of a\nwhite man.\n\nAlso, in that section where the Democratic Party is \nmost strongly entrenched in power, decent, intelligent, self-respecting\ncolored people are forced to ride on dirty, unventilated,\nand unseemly \"jim-crow\" cars.  Colored people find it\nalmost impossible to get Pullman accommodations in that section.\nMore than once, colored people who have insisted upon getting\nthese accommodations have lost their lives.

So we wrote and received a\nmost cordial invitation to send our\ndaughter to Andrew Academy.

Nov. 12, 1920.\nNothing could afford me more genuine pleasure than to speak at a \nmeeting called in the interest of our girls. We frequently say that \nthe boys and girls of to day are the men and women of tomorrow. But, \nif actions speak louder than words, there is no doubt that many of us \nexpress this thought without realizing what it means. We declare \nthat the boys and girls of to day will be the men and women of \ntomorrow as a poll parrot utters words he has been taught to say without \nhaving the slightest idea what they mean.\n   The best proof of the fact that many of us say the boys and \ngirls of to day will be the men and women of tomorrow as a poll \nparrot talks, is the painful manner in which thousands of our boys and \ngirls have been neglected. The civilization of a country is tested \nby the manner in which it cares for its women, its boys and girls. \nIf the physical welfare of the boys and girls of one generation is \nnot looked after properly, the men and women of the next and \nsucceeding generations may be stunted in growth and be weak. When one think\nhow few efforts have been put forth in the past by so-called, highly\ncivilized nations to care for the physical well-being of their youth,\nthe wonder is that there are so many men and women who are strong and \nsturdy to day. It seems nothing less than a miracle that there are \nso many able-bodied men and robust women, when we remember how our \nchildren have been allowed to disregard the rules of health, \nBut, if the physical welfare of our youth has been shamefully neglected, \nthe moral and spiritual development has been disregarded all the more.\nIt is only recently that even highly civilized nations have begun to realize\nthat it is the duty of the State to provide for the moral and spiritual\ndevelopment of its future citizens. It was because a patriotic, far-seeing \nman realized that if some special effort were not made to promote the \nspiritual and moral welfare of the young men of London that the first \nYMCA was established there in 1844. now seventy six years ago. Before\n\n\n2\nthat time even the most-highly civilized and the most Christian nations \nin the world had done little or nothing to provide especially for the religious \ntraining of young men except that offered them in the church. \nThe morals of the young men of Great Britain were declining with such \nalarming raphidity. They were plunging into dissipation of all kinds so \nfast that George Williams the founder of the YMCA, felt that unless something\nwere done speedily, the morals of thousands of young men in England\nwould be smirched and ruined beyond repair.\nAt first efforts were made by the YMCA only to provide for the religious \ntraining of young men. There was np use trying to close the nation's eyes \nto the fact that the great majority of young men had ceased to go to church.\nReligious services alone made slight appeal to the rank and file of the \nyoung men. But the music halls, the saloons and places of evil repute \nwere gathering them in by the thousands. So the founder of the YMCA was \nearly impressed with the fact that if nothing were done for the instructio\nrecreation and amusement of the young men whom they wanted to benefit,\nthe organization would fail to accomplish much of the work it had hoped to \ndo. And so it was decided to have noted speakers deliver lectures on subjects\nwhich would instruct, enlighten and interest young men. Social functions \nwere a given, a gumnasium was inaugurated and everything was done to \ndraw young men from the unfluences which were sapping their vitality and \ndestroying them body and soul.\nEleven years after the YMCA was founded, the YWCA was formed. Its founder\na Mrs. Robarts of Boston organized the first center in 1855. It was the \nfirst effort of the kind made in the United States to promote the spiritul \nand moral welfare of young women outside the church. For, while young \nwomen had not deserted the church in 1855 to the shocking extent practised \nby young men, nevertheless they had begun to remain away from the church \nin rapidly increasing numbers. Long before the Emancipation Proclmation \nwas signed, therefore, lo years before their colored sisters were even free\nit was deemed necessary to put forth herculean efforts outside the church \nto save the young white women of the United States, so many of whom were \nforsaking the straight and narrow way in which their grandmothers trod to \nwande off into by and forbidden paths.", "2", 81, 81, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00250", "607 Polk Ave Memphis\n1615 S.

At the close of the Cicil War the masses of colored people did\nnot know their A B Cs. To day one of the foremost pest of America is Paul\nLaurence Dunbar, for who this High School is named. He was a black man\nthru whose veins not a single drop of African blood was known to flow, \nand he was the son of ex-slaves.                                                \nThere is scarcely a college or a university of any repute in [this count] the North,\nEast or West from which colored students have not been graduated with honor. \nThe most coveted prizes of Harvard and Yale universities, have been\ncarried off by colored students. \nA few years ago there was hanging in the Luxembourg Gallery of Paris one \nof the finest paintings of modern times which was purchased by the Government \nof France. It was the work of a Colored-American. Mr. H.O. Tanner by                 \nname and [the honor which came to this colored] was award the fist prize over innumerable others painted by pick-\nartists from all over the world. And the honor which came to this young colored \nAmerican is all the greater, when one realizes upon how few American\nartists a similar honor had been bestowed at that time. \n         Sixty years ago slaves were penniless. According to the estimates\nsome they and their descendants are worth [between] several billion dollars, at least. \nIn various parts of the country there are well-established banks and flourishing \nstores which are owned and controlled by colored people. \n  In the professions we have dentists and doctors, women as well as men\nwhose practice is lucrative and large. We have litaerateur whose novels and\narticles in the press are the equal of the beset produced in the United                                                              \nStates.

During the sixth years that are before us, our\nstrides toward the highest and best civilization should be longer and far\nthan have been these of the past. And I verily believe they will. But it\nwould be as stupid to take for granted the success we have not yet attained\nas it would be to bewail the defeat we have not yet sustained.\n     Altho much has been accomplished to premot[r]e[d] the welfare of mankind\na great dela remains to be done. The Atlantic Cable has been successfully\nlaid, it is true, but means of communication must be established between\nraces which misunderstand, misrepresent and mistreat each other today, which\nwill put to the test the ingenuity, the industry, the courage and the faith\nof future benefactors, quite as much as laying the Atlantic Cable put the\ntest the wisdom and courage of Cyrus W.

This distinguished man, who had been making an exhaustive\nstudy of the mental capacity of the white and dark races respectively \nfor years, had not changed his point of view at all. The only change \nthat had been made was in the name of his magazine. He was now \neditor of La Revue Mondiale instead of La Revue de la Revue. \nNothing was more exhilirating and encouraging than a talk with \nthis great French writer who believed head, heart and soul in the fine \nmental and spiritual endowment of the dark races. Nobody has taken \nmore pains to explode the theory of the natural superiority of one \ngroup and the inevitable inferiority of another than Monsier Finot. \nHis large book on Race Prejudice (Le Prejuge' des Races) contains\nenough facts and arguments proving the fallacy of this position to\nconvince any human being who is open to conviction, who thinks and \nis sane. Nobody could take a more advanced stand on absolute \nequality between the white and black races than did the great French \nwriter. \nWhen I expressed the fear that the French might learn from the \nlarge number of Americans in their country how to discriminate \nagainst colored people he assured me that my fears were groundless\nand repeated what he had previously said: \"The French can no more \nlearn how to be prejudiced against human beings on account of their \ncolor than Americans can unlearn it.\" After publishing his large volume\non Race Prejudice Monsieur Finot wrote a shorter book entitled \n\"L'Agonie et la mort des Races, which his friend William Stead, then\neditor of the British Review of Reviews, translated into English \nunder the title \"The Death Agony of the Science of Race.\"\nIn this masterful production Monsieur Finot shows that \"the good\nin man is constantly leading him onward through the endless confusion \ncaused by international hatred and war towards the brotherhood \nof nations and races.

There was no Bureau of \nInformation in the little station, so I went to the window of the\nticket office and saw a young man standing there reading a magazine. \nDover is not a large city and the man whom I wished to reach was well\nknown there, both because he was a first class paper hanger and had\nbeen actively engaged in politics for years. \n\"I am a stranger here,\" I began, \"and I am trying to reach Mr. \nRoss whom I expected to meet me.

My good friend,\nCaptain James F. Oyster, was a prosperous business man who believed\nso thoroughly in business methods he insisted that any school officer\nwho failed to observe them should be dismissed, no matter how fine\nan instructor or officer he might be.\n\nI valued Captain Oyster's friendship, because he was one of nature's \nnoblemen, was always willing to assist me in my efforts to\nput through measures which I believed would improve the school system\nand I could rely absolutely upon any promise he made, because he\nwas courageous and outspoken almost to a fault and because he had as\nlittle race prejudice as it is possible for a man to have. When it\nlooked as though our friendship could not weather this storm, after\nI had tried to convert him to my point of view and had failed, I\nresigned myself to my fate, but held firmly and desperately to my\nefforts to prevent the supervising principal from being dismissed.\nI finally succeeded in saving the school officer and also in retaining\nthe friendship of Captain Oyster as well, because he was a\nbroad-minded man and when he finally yielded a point, he let the\ndead past bury its dead.\n\nDuring the eleven years I was a member of the Board of Education\nI often differed materially with the others, but I never had bitter\nwords or an open break with anybody. Perhaps I came as near having\n\n-340-\n\nfriction with a few members of the Executive Committee of the International\nLeague for Peace and Freedom as with any white people with\nwhom I was ever associated. I was asked to sign a petition requesting\nthe removal of the black troops from occupied German territory.\nI was told that all the other members of the Executive Committee\nwere willing to sign it and that it was especially desirable for me\nto affix my signature, because the Committee wished to make the request\nunanimous. Since I was the only colored member of the Committee,\nit was natural for them to want me to fall in line.\n\nOne of the women who talked with me about it was Mrs. La Follette,\nwife of the late Senator form Wisconsin, mother of the present Senator\nand of the Governor Wisconsin. What she said in favor of the\npetition impressed me deeply. She seemed to have no race prejudice\nwhatever and always had the courage of her convictions when she felt\nit was necessary to show where she stood on the Colored-American's\nright to a square deal. Both by word and by deed Mrs. La Follette\noften placed herself on record as being in favor of any legislation\nor of any effort designed to give colored people all the rights and\nprivileges which other citizens enjoy. I knew she wanted the petition\nsigned because she believed it would pour oil on the troubled\nwaters to have France remove her black troops from German soil. In\nsuch high esteem did I hold that broad-minded woman that nothing\nwould have afforded me greater pleasure than to comply with her\nrequest.\n\nOn the afternoon when Mrs. Lafollette invited me to her beautiful\nhome to have tea with her, therefore, I listened to the arguments\nshe presented in favor of it with an open mind. But, try as hard as\nI might, I could not see my way clear to sign that petition. I disliked,\nhowever, to be the only member of the Executive Committee to\nrefuse to sign it and thus make it impossible for the others to say\nthat their position on the matter was unanimous. After mature deliberation\nI decided it was my duty to resign and I wrote the following\nletter to Miss Jane Addams:", "23", 81, 81, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00266", "Aug. 15th [*[1952 ]*]\n\nDearest Mother,\n       So glad you are having such\na good time.

It is not a matter \nof majorities or minorities, it is not a \nquestion of schools or churches, of palaces\nor cottages.  It is that intangible something\nwhich may permeate the most complex international\naffairs, dominate a single city\nward, or inspire a group of any kind to work\nfor the common good.  It is the kindly spirit\nwhich holds all men as brothers-it is applied\nbrotherhood.  You cannot measure it\nor weight it or see it; you can only feel it.\nWhat is it?  It is equal opportunity for self\nexpression.  That self-expression must be\nof one's best, but everyone born into the\nworld has the right to demand his opportunity.\nThis does not mean that men are equal-\nthey are not.  It does not say that one man\nhas the right to as much as every other man\n-he may or he may not have the right.\nIt does not say to Rockefeller:  \"You must\ndivide your wealth with your neighbors,\"\nbut it does say to Rockefeller:  \"All your\nwealth shall not deprive your neighbor of\nhis opportunity.\"  It says to creeds:  \"Put\nbrotherhoods in your crucibles and test\nyour product by its alchemy.\"  It says to\nevery man:  \"Test your right to live and\nto enjoy by your desire to assist every\nother man to live and to enjoy.\"  This is\ndemocracy, and while its spirit has been\nThe work of the Town Meeting is developing\nthe latent powers of its citizens.  As\nthey seek their best self-expression-not\nonly that best in form and style, but that\nbest in thought and substance-they find,\nsometimes to their amazement, that they\nhave things to express of which they were\nnever conscious before.  It is no figure of\nspeech to say that their pent-up emotions,\nonce released, reveal new ides, new conceptions,\nnew thoughts, as hidden even to\nthemselves, as are the submerges logs in\nsome timber-jam just before the dam is\nbroken and the pressure is withdrawn.\nMoreover, our citizens are finding themselves\nnot simply in a readiness for debate,\nin thinking on their feet, but in the more\nconstructive activities of committee work.\nI have in mind recent reports of a committee\nwhose young chairman, untrained as he\nwas, brought to his work an open-mindedness\nand earnestness which would have\nbeen creditable to a veteran legislator.\nThe Town Meeting is bringing to the discussion \nof most civic questions a new point\nof view.  There is large humanness in our\nsociology.  The personal equation is prominent.\nThe questions are viewed from the \ninside; they are not investigated, laboratory\nfashion, from the outside.  Many of our\ncitizens are living, every day, the problems\nothers are reading about.  They know\nthe West End and the North End at first\nhand.  Many of them have lived through\nthe terrors of Kieff or Kishineff.  Many of\nthem know the misery of a steerage passage.\nTo all of them the problems of the\nsocial life are heart problems, not merely\nsubjects for academic discussion.  So the\nsober judgment of the Town Meeting is\nmore than an exercise in debate; it is an\nexperience of life.\nFinally the Town Meeting has the same\nspirit as the Sunday night meetings, the\nabounding brotherhood so dominant there.\nWe are not simply citizens; we are fellow\ncitizens and are, week by week, making fellowship\nand brotherhood more concrete in\napplication.  And as we make the fellowship\nof this our group more specific and certain,\nwe carve a more perfect stone to set into\nthe structure of the larger group, the State.\n\nTHE FORD HALL TOWN MEETING'S\nACHIEVEMENT UP TO DATE.\nBy Miriam Allen de Ford.\nOn the sixth birthday of our mother, the\nFord Hall Meetings, even so young a child\nas this Town Meeting of ours has a right\nto cast a glance backward and see what is \nthe tendency and what has been the accomplishment\nof the first three months of its\nexistence.\nThe biggest thing in which we have been\nconcerned is, perhaps, the soup kitchen\nnow being conducted for the benefit of the\nunemployed men of Boston by our Mr. and\nMrs. T. M. Moderator, and made possible\nby our co-operation with the School of Social\nScience and the Fabian Club.  That\nis the first concrete evidence we have had\nof our influence on the world outside; \nthough it was foreshadowed by the inclusion\nof our courtesies committee in the\nwork being done by the Consumers' League\nand the Women's Municipal League to\nclean up the bakeries of the West End.\nBefore long, also, we hope to see practical\nresults from our memorializing of the City\nof Boston as to closing Hull street to traffic\nto make it a playground for the children.\nIn self-educative work we have already\ndone much, learning many new aspects of\npublic questions, many new bits of insight\ninto each other's minds and lives, and\nmany new details of parliamentary rule\nand the practice of debate.  This last under\nthe particular guidance of Mr. Allen.  Such \ndiscussions as those over the municipal\nlodging house order, Mr. Victorson's immigration\nbill, Mr. Greene's marriage certificate\nbill, and the present one over the \n\"Oregon tin-plate\" bill, are of inestimable\nvalue.\nOur history is so short that any review\nof it must needs be short also, but no so\nshort that it cannot pay brief tribute to the\nsplendid work of our committees and to\nthe co-operation of such town Meeting\ncitizens as Mrs. Hoffman, Mr. Gallup, Mr.\nEwing, Mr. McKenna, Miss Rogolsky, Mr.\nand Mrs. Sullivan, Mr. Victorson and many\nothers-including \"our own\" Miss Crawford\nand Mr. Coleman.  While the 200 Town\nMeeting citizens are of this calibre we\ncannot but succeed.\n-\nLAST WEEK'S TOWN MEETING.\nWe missed \"Mrs. T. M. Moderator\" at\nour meeting last week, but we were glad\nto give her up for the sake of the great\nwork she is helping to do at the soup\nkitchen on Avery street.  That same soup \nkitchen and the work it is doing thinned\nour ranks somewhat-but what valuable\ncitizens they will be when they return, with\ntheir first-hand knowledge of some of the\nsocial conditions with which we are all\nconcerned!\n*  *  *  *\nIt is remarkable-and yet not remarkable\nin view of the same thing at the Sunday\nnight meetings-how citizens of totally\nvariant economic views get together without\nthe slightest personal friction, and how\nsocial and political opinions which must\nseem to some of us actually distressing\ncan yet be expressed with the speaker's\nfull knowledge and confidence that he will\nreceive a just and disinterested hearing.\nIt is the same spirit which has made Ford\nHall unique, and it is making our Town\nMeeting its equal in fairness of spirit.\n*  *  *  *\nAfter his long illness, it was good to see\nMr. Gutterson with us again.  It is a real\nfriend who will give his time and co-operation\nto us when he is scarcely recovered\nfrom weeks of confinement to his home.\n\n\nFORD HALL FOLKS     5\n\nOTHER FORUMS.\nBy George W. Coleman.\nThe Sunday evening meeting of the People's\nInstitute in Cooper Union, New York,\nis undoubtedly the oldest of the people's\nforums.  It had been in operation seven\nor eight years when I first made my acquaintance\nwith it.  It was the inspiration\nthat I received there that led to the establishment\nof the Ford Hall Meetings. \"The\nPeople's Sunday Evening\" in Rochester, N.\nY., was started just about the same time\nthat we started in Boston.  The Sunday\nEvening Club in Chicago came into existence\nthe same year too, I think.  Thus when\nthe Ford Hall Meetings were founded by the\nBoston Baptist Social Union in February,\n1908, there were three other large popular\nSunday evening forums of somewhat similar\ncharacter already under way in three other\nnorthern and eastern cities.\nNow, six years later, there are eighteen\nsimilar enterprises in operation of which I\nhave personal knowledge.  Fourteen of them\noriginated among church people and at\nleast ten of them are held in church buildings.\nThe Young Men's Christian Association\nhas fathered two or three of them.\nTen of them are in Massachusetts, two are\nin New Hampshire, two in New York State,\none in New Jersey, one in Michigan, one in\nVirginia, and one is Lausanne, Switzerland.\nThis latter organization was promoted by\nnon-church men exclusively and became so\npopular in a very short time that it was\nforced by the need of accommodations to\nmove from the City Council Chamber to the\nlargest church in the city.\nThe Open Forum at Manchester, N. H., \nis one of the youngest and most successful\nof these new forums.  The Young Men's\nChristian Association is responsible for it.\nThe meeting place is a theatre that will\nhold 1500 people, and it is not large enough\nto accommodate the crowds who seek admittance.\nThis Manchester organization in\nevery feature is almost identical with that\nof the Ford Hall Meetings.\nThe Sunday Commons in Boston, now in\nits third or fourth season, has gained a \nwide reputation, though it has suffered a\ngood deal from inadequate financial support.\nThe Boston School of Social Science has\nbeen increasingly successful through several\nseasons.  One forum that prospered for\nthree years in a Boston suburb was given\nup and one or two others that were begun\ndid not last beyond their first season.\nThe principles and methods on which the\nFord Hall Meetings are based have been\nexpounded before representative gatherings\nof citizens in places as far west as Minneapolis,\nColorado Springs, and Dallas, Texas,\nand in cities as far south as Richmond and\nNew Orleans, as well as in New York,\nPhiladelphia, and Baltimore, and in many\nsmaller cities in New England, New York,\nand Pennsylvania.  Literature describing\nthe work done at Ford Hall has gone all\nover the country through the newspapers\nand leading magazines, and requests for information\nand assistance are coming in\nevery day from many directions.\nThe work of establishing public forums\nafter the manner  of our own successful enterprise\ncould well take all the time and\nstrength of a very capable man, but there\nis no one who is free to take up the burden\nexcept as a few of us do what we can in\nthat direction as occasion permits.\n=\nSunday Afternoon Conversations\nCOME!\nCommencing March 1st at 4 P.

Mr. Foster,\nbesides being Moderator of the Town Meeting,\nhas been the friend and advisor of every one\nof the Ford Hall Folks who has had troubles\nto lighten or problems to solve.\n=\nFORD HALL FROM THE STANDPOINT\nOF THE PRESS.\nBy A. J. Philpott, of the Boston Globe.\nAs a newspaperman, the Ford Hall meetings\nappeal to me because they don't profess\nmore than they perform.  It is usually\nthe other way.  And the people who attend\nthe meetings regularly are without bias and\nare intelligent enough to look on both sides\nof any question with candor and fairness.\nThey play no favorites.  They are not afraid\neither to listen to or discuss any decent subject,\nand they do both with the kind of intelligent\nconsideration and respect that\nmarks true politeness.\nThe meetings seem to me wholly in line\nwith the true ideals of American Democracy\n-justice and fairness toward all.  And\nthey are in direct line with the educational\nprogress of the age.  The meetings prove\nthat there is a strong desire in the people\nfor accurate knowledge, or for light, on the\nvital questions of the day; and it is fortunate\nthat the meetings have not been\ndominated by any group or class that would\nregard themselves as the chosen people or\nthe otherwise elect.\nBesides all this, however, I am deeply\nconscious of the fact that the success of\nthe Ford Hall meetings is largely due to\nthe man and woman in whom the qualities\nI like best in meetings, find such adequate\npersonal expression-George W. Coleman\nand Mary C. Crawford.\nAnd finally, the Ford Hall meetings prove\nto me that Boston is not wholly and East-wind\nstate of mind, and that at least the\nresidents of Boston who attend Ford Hall\nSunday evenings have a good deal of feeling\nand regard-for others.  The term\n\"brotherhood\" is not a meaningless metaphor\nwith them.\n\nNEW CHURCH LECTURES\nYou are cordially invited to attend a course of three free lectures in\nFORD HALL\nThursday evenings, March 12th, 19th, and 26th, at 8 o'clock, when the following questions \nwill be answered from the standpoint of the New Church:\nI.

I was sort of in the habit of\nmeeting the boats that brought Americans from Paris to England\nand then I would ride on the train with them. [I was\nin England nearly two years and I was what you might call\nhomesick to see and hear countrymen talk] It was mighty interestin\nto listen, as they expressed themselves about the War on general \nprinciples and Paris in particular. When a fellow's been away\nfrom home nearly two years, he just natcherly likes to see folks\nthat come from God's country and hear them speak good old United\nStates. And then you must remember I was engaged-Yes sir, engaged\nto the best girl in the whole State of Illinois. I aint no goody\ngoody boy-nothing like that- Not on your life- But I was pretty\ndecent all during the  War and I liked to talk to a good woman once\nin a while. Perhaps almost unbeknownst to myself I was on the lookout \nfor one. She didn't have to be pretty and she didn't have to\nbe very young. But she did have to be interesting. There's nothin\nlike an interesting woman that's got something to say and knows\nhow to say it, when a fellow'swants to forget what a long stretch\nof weeks there is between him and his girl.\n\nWell I was looking for a seat on this train that was taking\nParis passengers to Londonshortly after the War, and I spied an empty \none by a dame. There was nothin at all strikin about her, mind\nyou. While she was not what you call homely at all, she would not\nhave taken a prize in a beauty show anywhere on earth. She sat\nnext to the window and when I took a seat beside her, she did not\nlook around. She was evidently enjoying the English scenery and\nevery now and then she would tap a pencil on the window sill.\nFinally she dropped it and I picked it up for her. She thanked me\nand that started a conversation of course. While she was an American\nthere was something sort of foreign looking about her. I didn't know what it was\nShe loved the French and gushed like a school girl, when she\nreferred to their pluck. 'You look sort of like you might be French yourself, Maam have some\nFrench blood in you, Maam, if you'll pardon me for [saying so] making that remark\nShe blushed like a girl, when I said that. [No] \"I am swarthy, it\nis true, an I may have some French blood, she explained, but if I\nhave I do not know it. I felt certain she either had French or\nSpanish blood in her veins.\nTalkin to that woman was one of the red letter days in my life.\nShe was as wise as a serpent, but you could see was a lay [throu]\nthrough and through. We talked about everything under the sun\nthat concerns women and men. She gave me some suggestions, thats\nwhat she called them, because she said she never gave what nobody\nlikes to receive- advise. We talked about marriage, children,\ndivorce and all the rest of it. Gee, How that woman could talk.\nShe could really use language. She didn't use words with six syllables, \nnor spout like a book nor emit philosophy at every turn\nof the tongue.  [and neither did she do a little monologue all\nher lonesome.] She gave me a chance to throw in a word or two]\nedgewise. And I haven't told you about her voice. It was what\nfolks who write books call musical I imagine she could give you a\nlot of sob stuff to a T, if you felt that way about it.\nBut she could just tell you what she thought [uin] words that went\nstraight to your head and then fell kerplunk right down into your heart.\n[*More of her tongue and she did not do a monologue\nall by her little lonesome-nothin like that*]", "2", 81, 81, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00265", "things I'd like to tell you.

We talked about marriage, children, divorce\nand all the rest of it. Gee! how that woman could talk! She could really use language. I\nmean. She didn't use words with six syllables nor spout like a book nor let out philosophy at every turn of the tongue. Neither did she do a little monologue all by her lonesome. No sir She gave me a chance to throw a word in edgewise every now and then. And\nI haven't told you about her voice. It was what folks who write books call 'musical'.\nI immagine she could give you a lot of sob stuff to a T, if she felt that way about it.\nShe could just tell you what she thought in words that went straight to your head and\nthen fell kerplunk right down into your heart.\n     Durin' the conversation I learned that she had a grown daughter and a son, both of\nthem married. I mean she must have started in double harness young, for she didn't look\nold enough to be that far down the pike. But--old or young, I never enjoyed talkin' to a\ndame more than I did to that one. I clean forgot that she was not as young or as pretty as\nshe used to be. So, when we reached London--Ole Lunnon town-- I asked her if she knew where\nshe was goin' to stop. She said she had no idea- that she had tried to get a stopping\nplace, before she left Paris, but had failed. Every hotel she had written to had replied\nthat there was no room.\n     \"Right you are\", I said, \"Everybody's growlin' that comes to London these days,\nbecause they have no place to lay thier head. But I happen to know where you can get a good\nroom for a week anyhow,\" I said.\n     Then I gave her the address of a large building rented by a well-known rich American organization as its headquarters. I wont call its name. What's the user? The dame did\nnot seem so eager to take the address and I could not understand why she should hesitate.\nIt suddenly occurred to me that she might not know how to reach the building, so I offred\nto take her there. She got as red as a beet, when she declined the offer, saying that she\nhad to go somewhere else first, that she knew how to find her way about London, as she had\n\n(A DoughboyVs Fatal Mistake 2)\n\n\n3.\nbeen there before. If she had been younger, I could have understood why she was so embarrassed and confused. Anyhow I gave her my card and told her if I could assist her in \nanyway to let me know. I never hated to leave a woman I had known only a couple of hours\nas bad as I hated to leave that one.\n\"If all women talked as sensible to young men, as you have talked to me, Maam, the\nworld would be better off,\"I said. Then I left her.\n\n\"Say, did a middle aged American dame come here to get a room this mornin'?\", I\nasked the girl at the desk, whose business it was to assign rooms. \"I knew you had three\nor four, so I sent the lady here.\"\nI had been thinkin' about the woman all day so I thought I would blow into Headquarters\nabout six o'clock to find out what had happened.\nI had hardly let the last word of my question go, when the girl burst out into\nthe heartiest laugh I had heard in a long time.\n\"You boob, you\", she jerred, \"Where did you come from any way! Why did you send\nthat woman here to get a room? Are you blind? Don't you know-- couldn't you see that woman\nwas colored?\"\nI was never more taken off my feet in all my life than I was when that girl told\nme that.\n\"She was swarthy\", I admitted,\" but I could never have believed that woman was colored.\"\n\"Well, I thought she was the moment I laid eyes on her. What right has an American\nwoman to be swarthy? I ask you that. Anyhow I wouldn't take a chance. She knew why I\nwouldn't let her have a room here. I could see that in her eye. She was very much embarrassed,\nwhen she left.\n\"Oh, I've seen many an American as dark as she was was, who was white,\" I said,\n\"And I believe you've made an awful mistake.\"\nAbout three days after that I got a letter written on a strange hand:\n\"I thank you so much for you effort to get me a room\", the note said, \"Because you\nwere so eager to assist me I went to the address you gave me in spite of the fact that I\nhad many misgivings.

When this form of Government, so constituted, shall become \ndestructive of the aims stated, then \"it is the right of the people to alter\nor change it and to institute new Government,\" as will most nearly \nembody the ideas of the people. \n\nHere are the foundation stones of American and world democracy. \n\nHas the time come for a Commission of American great-hearts to \nformulate a national education program based upon such foundation? I \nbelieve it has! May I presume to put into definite propositions the \npossible findings of such a Commission? \n\n1. We propose a program of education which shall \"bring effectively \nwithin the reach, not only of every boy and girl, but also of every adult \ncitizen, all the training, physical, mental, and moral, literary, technical \nand scientific, of which he is capable.\"\n\n2. Every citizen in America shall be taught to read and write and \nthink in the English language. Laws shall not be passed forbidding the \nuse of other languages in America, whether spoken or written, but rather \nhelps to the acquiring of our language, and that all those between the \nages of twenty and fifty years, having been five years in America and \nnot yet able to read and write in our language be subject to punishment, \neven deportation, because they show that they do not desire to become \ngenuine citizens of America. \n\n3. Day schools and night schools shall be open at convenient places \nthroughout America, that such peoples may acquire our language and e \ntaught our ideals. \n\n4. There shall be no discrimination in the teaching of the childhood \nof America, but all, irrespective of race, condition, or creed, shall have \nequal opportunity under equally trained teachers, to discover the best \nthat is in them. There shall be no division of the public money so as \nto perpetuate differences of race, condition, or creed. \n\n5. Acquisition of knowledge shall be secondary to the moral growth \nof the individual. All subjects taught shall have for their purpose the \ndevelopment of Christian character, moral courage, energy, individual \ninitiative, a keen sense of civic duty and national responsibility. \n\n6. During the years between the ages of five and fifteen shall be \ntaught those subjects best fitted to produce such results as mentioned. \nThe subjects will, of course, include language, literature, mathematics, \nscience, and art. Teachers shall be required to report each year the \nseeming bent of each student's mind as revealed by marked love and \nefficiency in certain studies. Massachusetts, and possibly other stats, \nnow requires this. At a time not later than fifteen or eighteen years of \nage, opportunity will be given for each student to follow his natural      \nbent, so that each shall become the largest worth to himself and to society. \n\nHOWARD UNIVERSITY RECORD \n\n79\n\nSurely the State, investing so much in a child, is highly concerned that \nthe child shall find his natural field of endeavor. The misfits of the \nworld are the tragedy of the world. \n\nThe proper question here to ask is, - How shall the schools find the \nnatural aptitudes of our young people and lead them to select such  \ntrades or professions as apparently offer them greatest opportunity for \nadvancement?\n\nI have been watching with increasing eagerness the endeavors of business \norganizations to meet such a question. Listen to these words from \none prophet in the business world. Speaking of the misfits and the \nstruggle of his form to properly locate men for life tasks, he says:\n\n\"We aim to make him decide what it is he wants to make of himself \nin the final analysis; we try to make him think of his future as a definite \nshaped thing; we aim to make him plan his life just as he might plan \na house if he were thinking of building one. \n\n\"This sounds simple, but, as a matter of fact, it is rather a difficult \njob. Ask each man out of the average thousand just what he wants to \nbe, and a very small percentage will give intelligent answers. \n\n\"This is the handicap confronting all intelligent, serious-minded employers \ntoday. It is a handicap confronting the employed.\" \n\nThe findings of the business world are startlingly true when we review \n the history of a large number of our college graduates. It is ofttimes \ndisheartening to educators to find so many college graduates lying around \nthe world scarce able to earn a proper living. While 'tis true that college \nmen rule the world, yet could all college men have found themselves \nin their tasks, certainly the world would be much better ruled - for the \nhigher the type of citizenship, the higher the type of government. \n\nGo into any large city and how many college derelicts may be found!\nWhy? Many of them graduated with the sense that their college diploma\ndemanded a certain immunity from the real toil of the world, and now \nthe world owed them a living, instead of the fact that they owed the \nworld a life. Could they have been fitted for their real places, could they \nhave been directed to their real opportunity for success, what a vast \neconomic gain and a vast accretion of power would have been added to \nthe nation. \n\nOn April 2, 1917, the President of the United States penned to his\nfellow citizens these words:\n\n\"Right is more precious than peace, and we shall fight for the things \nwhich we have always carried nearest our hearts-for democracy, for \nthe right of those who submit to authority to have a voice in their own \ngovernments.\"\n\nOn April 6, a joint resolution passed by the United States Senate and \nHouse of Representatives reads thus:\n\n\"The state of war between the United States and the Imperial German ", "35", 81, 81, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-003:00289", "yet.

For forty years she has kept at her studies and the result was this awful world conflagration through which we have just come.  Had that program been one of altruism, of righteousness, she would have conquered the world in peace and led all the nations as victor.\n     Such a national educational program as I have suggested would at least clarify our present confusion of thought and our present clashing of personal, state, and national issues.\n     Suppose America had such a clearly defined educational policy!  How would it work?  In the first place, we would be able to find that elusive something which we call Americanism and which differentiates us from other nations.  From many sources have I endeavored to gain a definition of Americanism.  What is it that makes an American and American, as distinct from a Canadian, an Englishman, a Frenchman?  I can submit only my own imperfect definition: It is that spiritual genius which would discover in every person the divine right to all the best things God can give; the fullest opportunity to grow into those best things and then most largely manifest them in religious, social, economic, and political life.\n    If this were our policy and program, how all diffuse elements would\nbecome merged into one great whole? The program in Massachusetts\nand the program in Michigan would be the same as the program in\nMississippi and Maryland, in New Mexico and Maine, in Connecticut\nand California, and all would be growing citizens of similar national and\ninternational ideals. We should find no sectionalism then, no northern\nvote or southern, no eastern vote or western, but Americans all, voting\nfor noblest American ideals.\n    Indulge me in this delightful excursion of fancy, for I see in such a\nplan how many of our ills, our sins, our national crimes would be\nblotted out, and how soon that day of brotherhood, towards which all\nearth's real prophets have eagerly looked, would be ushered in, at least\nfor our own land. Such a Commission would be bigger than any local\npride or selfishness or prejudice. It would see clearly the contribution\nwhich each class of people and each race really has to offer for the\nlarger glory of our country, and would arrange an educational program\nsuch as to bring forth from the heart of each people its best. Here\nwould we find the Germans solidity, the Anglo-Saxon energy, the Celtic\nimagination, the Latin delicacy, the colored man's music and laughter,\nand the yellow man's reverence for things that have been, all blending\ninto one splendid being we call the real American.\n    If we take our psychological and anatomical microscopes, examining\nclosely the process now going on, we shall find that such is our present\n\n\nHOWARD UNIVERSITY RECORD                               77\n\ndrift.

In the Cabin of the\nMayflower the ideals of the Colonists and the government to be were\nclearly enunciated and we have that immortal agreement. The voice of\nCaptain John Hopkins, the young commander of the first armed brig of\nthe navy of the new nation, echoed through Independence Square, in\nPhiladelphia, as he read to that hushed assembly the Declaration of\nIndependence. That voice still echoes.\n    Possibly these two documents enshrine the very ideals for which we\nseek, and if so, surely it is practical wisdom for an American Commission\nto now sit and determine a national educational system that shall\nmake these ideals regnant.\n    Let us examine those great documents, if perchance we can discover\nour national goals not only for one hundred years, but for many hundreds\nor even thousands of years to come.\n    The two documents state these propositions: \"All men are created\nequal and endowed with certain unalienable rights, among which are\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" To secure these rights we\norganize ourselves into a government \"for the better ordering and preservation\nand furtherance of the glory of God, the advancement of the\nChristian Faith and the honor of our country.\" Such a Government\ngains its power from the consent of the governed.

How wonderfully our\neducational institutions responded! In that mad, yet marshalled, rush,\nold theories, old standards, old landmarks were trampled down. What\nis the quickest method of selecting competent officers? The army psychological\ntests made answer! What is the shortest time in which men\ncan be prepared for such responsible tasks? Personal supervision and\ndaily tests made answer! What will arouse the spirit to excel? Patriotism,\ncompetition, reward by commission, and pride in doing one's best\nfor national and world democracy! Never did an age behold such an\noutpouring of enthusiasm, of loyalty, and of genius! Where before\nthere were dull or listless students, now there were alert, eager students.\nWhere before many were aimless, now they saw their goal. Educators\nwakened to discover potential powers of which they scarcely dreamed.\nThe colleges had been dealing with latent energy, capable of vastest expression,\nbut somehow unliberated in former times. The new demand\nof educators is that they focus that energy upon the natural aptitudes of\ntheir students and then present opportunities in education for those aptitudes\nto be developed until the student is fitted to go to his life's task.\n    The history of education presents already a blazed path along which\nsuch a highway may be built. The Germans have been working out a\nsystem called the Einheitsschule. The principle underlying this system\nis that all children between certain ages shall have a common educational\nfoundation and educational opportunities suited to their abilities.\n    One group of thinkers contend that all children between the ages of\nsix and twelve shall have such a common educational foundation, and\nthen such educational opportunities thereafter as shall be suited to their\npositions and abilities. This, of course, keeps in mind that class distinction\nwhich is the curse of many nations and the absence of which is the\nglory of America. Another group of thinkers, and the one we trust\nwhich will prevail, declares that this school shall be for all children\nbetween the ages of six and twenty-two or twenty-four with selections all\nthe way along those years fitted to individual aptitudes.\n    This latter would destroy class privileges and permit every child to \ncome at least to his rightful places in the world's work, if properly guided\nand advised.\n    The purpose underlying the new educational plan of our own Howard\nUniversity is to meet this great need in education. The first two years\nof college study are listed as the Junior College. The last two years are\n\nHOWARD UNIVERSITY RECORD                      81\n\nlisted as Senior Schools. In the Junior College is taught those great common\nbranches of study, lacking which no student can be considered educated.\nBut, through those two years, run clearly defined courses, pursuance\nof which leads to a definite senior school where the student will\nspecialize and immediately on graduation be qualified to enter his chosen\nwork or profession. Our senior and graduate schools are, at present,\noffering sixteen fields of study in which to specialize. We shall offer\nother courses as soon as local conditions will permit. Our hope is that\nall our students may find their aptitudes met in one or more of these\nschools.\n    The practical working of the system will be as follows:\n    Suppose a student enters the Freshman Class, knowing exactly what\nhe desires to do for his life's work. Suppose that work is a business\ncareer. Through the Junior College of two years, his studies will lead\ndirectly to the Senior School of Commerce and Finance. Here he will\nspecialize for two years, graduating at the end of four years' work with\nthe degree of \"B.S. in Commerce and Finance,\" and then go directly to\nhis work.\n    Suppose a student enters the Freshman Class, not knowing what he\nwants to do. Our system of careful selection will, we hope, enable him\nto discover himself before the first, and certainly before the second year\nis passed. Having made his decision, he may then go to the Senior\nSchool of his choice, specialize for two years, and, graduating with the\ndegree of that School, go at once to his life's work.\n    If the student desires to take four years of general culture, ere going\nto any special or graduate school, the School of Liberal Arts offers him\nthat opportunity with a B.A. or a B.S. as graduating degree.\n    This means that no student will be cast adrift without definite fitness\nfor some particular line of work, but in college will be prepared directly\nfor his after career.\n    We shall attempt to discover every student to himself by giving him a\npersonal advisor and friend, by careful observation of class records, and\neven by faculty groups in consultation over individual students and with\nthem. This will entail great care and labor, but surely the results will\nmore than compensate.\n    At once we shall be faced with that problems which has been the wonder\nof thinkers. The doctor's son may not wish to be a doctor, but rather a\nfarmer. The minister's son may not wish to be a minister, but an\nengineer. The musician's son may turn to the soldier's profession.

July 12 1903\n\nMy dear Frank: [Allen]\nTo dive right into the midst of the subject, let me say that you will make the mistake of your life according to my humble opinion if you decide upon Chester. There is no comparison between Chester and Allegheny or Pittsburg for such a man as you are. In the last two places there is everything before you, in Chester your field of labor is necessarily circumscribed. I do hope you will decide upon Pittsburg or Allegheny, for I am sure as one can be of anything human that your success will be assured, if you do. Every single solitary physician who has gone to Pittsburg has been a success, so far as I can learn. Not one of them can be compared with you either from the standpoint of natural capacity or from preparation for the work. As a rule, I do not try to decide such an important subject as the place in which to settle for anybody, for it is too vital a question to be discussed lightly. In this case, however, I am so fully persuaded that it is the best thing for you to do for a variety of reasons that I shall feel disappointed and disheartened, I fear, if you don't choose my burg. Now to the other question - to whom to give you a letter or rather whom to advise you to see. Dr. Turflee (I have no idea whether that is the way to spell his name or not) is a very homely man to look upon, but he is a very successful physician, and is highly respected by all. He was sent as a delegate to some big convention by the white medical society of Pittsburg, once upon a time. You wouldn't think it to look at him, but I am told it is a fact. Go to see him and say I sent you. Tell him I delivered the graduating address for the Avery Trade School one year ago, if he does not recall me. The Brown brothers are fine fellows, I think, and they have been very successful.

MARY CHURCH TERRELL\n\nWhen you call George Washington\n\"First in peace,\" please remember\nthat a young slave girl was the first\nperson in the world, publicly, to refer\nto him in that way.  It was Phyllis\nWheatley, a young African poetess,\nwho wrote a poem in his honor and\nin one of the lines addressed him as\n\"First in peace and honours.\" several\nyears before the Declaration of Independence\nwas signed.\nIf you had been walking down the\nstreets of Boston, Mass., one day in\n1761 you might have seen a poor little\nblack girl, wrapped only in a piece\nof carpet, shivering with the cold.\nIf you had asked,  \"What is your\nname, little girl?\" she would not have\nunderstood you, and even if she had\nunderstood and answered your question,\nher name would have sounded\nvery queer to you.  For she was a \nlittle foreigner.  She had been born\nin Africa, had been stolen from her\nnative land, packed like a sardine in\na slave ship with many others of her\ncountrymen, and suffered the horrors\nand tortures of what was called \"the\nmiddle passage,\" and had been\nbrought by white men to this country\nto be sold as a slave.\nA lady who wanted to train a young\nservant to take the place of an old\none who was growing too old to work,\nwent to the slave market in Boston\nto see what she could find in that line.\nThe pathetic face of the shivering\nchild appealed to this woman wo\nstrongly that she bought her in spite\nof the fact that her little body appeared\nso frail.\nSixteen months from that time she\nwas reading the most difficult passages\nin the Bible.  Six years from \nthe day she was sold she had become\nso proficient in speaking and writing\nthe English language she had written\na poem to the University of Cambridge,\nnine years from the day she\nhad been bought as slave she had\npublished a poem on the death of a\ndistinguished clergyman, and 12 years\nafter entering Mrs. Wheatley's service\nher volume of poems was published \nin London.\nPhyllis was very fortunate in having\nMrs. Wheatley as her mistress.\nLet us pause long enough to give a \nrousing, rising vote of thanks to that\nlady.  The law did not force her to be\nmerciful to the little slave and nobody\nexpected her to give the girl a chance.\nIn her new home Phyllis became\nthe special servant of Mrs. Wheatley's\ntwins, Nathaniel and Mary, who\nwere 10 years older that their little slave.\nOne day Mary saw the little African\ntrying to form letters on a wall with\na piece of chalk.  She doubtless\nthought it would be great fun to teach\nher.  She tried and the progress\nmade by her black pupil was the sensation\nof that time.  What a debt of\ngratitude her race and the whole\nworld owe to Mary Wheatley!  Very \nsoon Phyllis began to write poems\n\"for her own amusement.\" the preface\nto her book states.  \"As to her writing,\"\nsays her master,  \"her own\ncuriosity led her to it.\"\nPhyllis did not know when or where\nshe was born.  She only knew she\ncame from somewhere in Africa.  She\nhave been born either in 1753\nnot later than 1754, it is\nhe was probably between\nof age when she wa\n\ndragged more dead than alive from\nthe slave ship in Boston.\nWhen she was 20 years old her\nhealth began to fail and her friends\nthought a sea voyage would do her\ngood.  Mr. Wheatley happened to be\ngoing abroad on business and he took\nPhyllis with him to England, where\nshe had the time of her young life.\nShe was the guest of the Countess of\nHuntingdon, was received by the lord\nmayor of London and by Lord Dartmouth,\nwas feted, petted and honored\nby the culture and aristocracy of Great\nBritain.  Her book, entitled \"Poems\non Various Subjects, Religious and\nMoral, by Phyllis Wheatley, Negro\nServant of Mr. John Wheatley of\nBoston in New England,\" was published\nduring this visit in 1773.  It\nwas dedicated to her English hostess\nand patroness as follows:  \"To the\nRight Honourable the Countess of\nHuntingdon, the following pages are\nmost respectfully inscribed, by her\nmuch obliged, very humble and \ndevoted servant, Phyllis Wheatley.\"\nThus it was that the Wheatley family\nbecame immortalized, for it would long\nago have been forgotten, if it had not\nbeen for the genius of a slave.\nIn order to prove to those who\nwould doubt that the African girl\nreally wrote the poems, Mr. Wheatley\nhad some of the most distinguished\ncitizens in New England\nvouch for this fact.  In one of \npreliminary pages of the book\nexcellency, Thomans Hutchinson, governor,\nand the lieutenant-governor,\ntogether with 16 other representative\ncitizens signed their names to the\nfollowing statement:  \"Phyllis, a\nyoung Negro girl, who was but a few\nyears since brought an uncultivated\nbarbarian from Africa, has ever since\nbeen and is now under the disadvantage\nof serving as a slave in a\nfamily in this town, has been examined\nby some of the best judges and\nis thought qualified to write them.\"\nOn the day Phyllis received a letter\nfrom George Washington, then commander\n-in-chief of the army and the \nfuture president of the United States,\nin which he complimented her upon\nthe poem written in his honor, she\nmust have been very happy indeed.\nHe addressed her as \"Miss Phyllis,\"\nand declared she \"exhibited striking\nproof of poetical talent.\"  \"If you ever\ncome to Cambridge or near headquarters,\"\nhe wrote her,  \"I shall be happy\nto see a person so favored by the\nmuses and to whom nature has been\nso liberal and beneficent in her dispensation.\nI am, with great respect,\nyour obedient, humble servant, George\nWashington.\"\nWhen she was about 25, Phyllis\nmarried John Peters, a man of her\nown Race, and seems to have been\nunhappy.  She lived only five years\nafter her marriage and was working\nin an ordinary boarding house when\nshe died, Dec. 5, 1784, in her 31st year.\nThis poetess was a full-blooded\nAfrican, so that her talent and attainments\ncannot be attributed to th\nadmixture of Caucasian or any oth\nblood in her veins.\nIf any other human being, black,\nwhite, yellow, red or brown, ha\nmade such marvelous intellectual\nprogress and achieved such\nliteratary success in such a short time\nunder similar circumstances as Phyllis\nWheatley [?]  [?]  [?]\ndo not [?]", "67", 163, 163, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-023:00427", "The Funny Side of the Negro Problem.\nBy One of Them.\n\nThere are few things in life so sad that\nthere isn't a funny side to them.

Will \nthe college woman refuse this challenge?\n\n------------\nThe President's Message \n------------\nFor fifteen years the College Alumnae Club has been in \nexistence in the city of Washington, but not always has its \npresence been realized. \n\nAt first its influence was felt only by the few women who \nin 1910 became its charter members and later by small groups \nthat gathered with them for recreation or study in the former \nquarters of the Young Women's Christian Association. It \nwas with a possessive pride that the members of the College \nClub gathered in that home on T Street, for the thoughts \nwhich they had put into such material things as a bookcase, \na table, chairs, and dishes had somehow become transmitted \ninto spiritual ties that drew both high school girl and college\nwoman to the Club meetings on Tuesday, Friday, or Saturday \nwith the enthusiasm of those who came into their own. \n\n7\n\nSince then the Young Women's Christian Association \nwith its Girl Reserves, the Girl Scout movement, and the high \nschool with its wide range of activities, have supplanted the \nCollege Alumnae Club in its direct work with the girls of  \nthe community. It is now chiefly through the scholarship \nto the girls of the Dunbar and Armstrong High \nSchools that there is still some contact preserved, but is there \nenough.? In spite of intermittent attempts of the College \nAlumnae Club to befriend the high school girl who is here \nwithout parents or special guardian, does she think of one of \nits members when she wants advice or when she naturally \ndesires recreation, but dreads seeking it alone?\n\nThough she does not, there is no reason why she should \nnot. The College Alumnae Club is interested in youth and \nhas as one of its aims service to youth. Let her goal for subsequent \nyears be to make the contacts that will afford opportunity \nfor service in greater degree and wider fields, and \nthus cause her influence to be felt for girls, not only locally \nbut nationally. \n\nGradually the \"grown-ups\" of Washington have become \naware of the existence of this organization. More of their \ndaughters and sisters, and some of their wives, have joined the \nranks of the club; they themselves have come to share in the \npride of the club when one of its members has achieved scholastic \nhonor; they have graciously loosened their purse strings \nto help with the Scholarship Fund. \n\nTo them the College Alumnae Club would express its \nappreciation for their confidence; but how much more wonderful  \nto offer them the vision of the club as one of the agencies \nof public welfare, as a source of the best in Art and Literature, \nas a potent force in the bringing about of more desirable educational \nfacilities for their children, and a happier community \nlife for themselves!\n\nThat the torch started by those few women fifteen years \nago has been kept alive until its flame has been fanned into \na national glow will be seen in the account of the National \nAssociation of College Women told elsewhere in these pages \nby its president, Lucy D. Slowe. \n\nSuffice it now for me to say in closing that such radiation \nmust keep constant its central warmth. If the possession of \na few furnishings in the quarters of another organization \ncreated warmth of spirit, how much more will the ownership \nof our own clubhouse cement the bonds of union among ourselves, \nand insure the permanency of our institution in the community! \nA magazine that will serve not alone as the repository \nof recorded activities, but as a clearing house of the literary \nwares of the group will aid in the development and conservation", "73", 157, 157, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-027:00489", "14\n\nAt our March meeting we were at home to the Senior\ngirls of Howard University.

Some will go into new communities; others\nwill doubtless return home; and still others will remain as\npart of the National Capital.  Each goes out from her Alma\nMater, however, with these assets: a well trained mind, vision\nof what is best and highest in life, and determination to\nhold up the light of these ideals wherever she may be.  Although\none ray of light shines far into the darkness, the\ncombination of many rays alone, causes darkness to be entirely\ndispelled and makes visible that which exists within\nits radius.  And so it is with the college women in her community\n-her single effort may be likened to the single ray,\neffective in its narrow path, but limited in the reflection of\nits light.  Since she constitutes a small proportion of the\nwomen of her community, her light, therefore, must be all\nthe more intense in order that her presence may be discovered\nand felt.\nLet us see what factor will be best bring about this influence\nof the college woman.  It is organization which means\nstrength through union of individuals for more effective work.\nSuch union results in a community of ideas and a quickening\nenthusiasm gained by the blazoning of many torches.  Organization\namong college alumnae, then, is valuable, in that it\nfurnishes a medium through which the ideas of individuals\nmay be translated into action.\nSurely worth while results must follow the formation of\nCollege Women's Club.  I shall point out a few which I hope\nin turn will cause you to think of others.  In the first place,\na College Alumnae Club breaks down all barriers among college\nwomen, for it is the broadest and most democratic of all\nunions of Alumnae.  While you have been in your university\nyou may have come in intimate contact with only a limited\nportion of your fellow stduents.  Perhaps friends have been\nmade because of work in classes, in societies, or in sororities. \nAt the same time you have had opportunity to know but few\nwomen of other colleges.  When you graduate, many of these\nties will be severed.

You will find it a shrine in which you \nmay keep burning your light of inspiration. It will answer \nthe query as to the Value of Organization Among College \nAlumnae. \n-------\nOur Scholarships\n-------\nGeorgiana R. Simpson \n\nIt is not surprising that a group of women with the \nbroader vision that college training has given them should \nwish to inspire others to prepare themselves for the larger \nlife and usefulness which higher culture insures. \n\nThe College Alumnae Club when still a young organisation, \nyielded to this impulse and accepted the privilege which \nlay in the establishment of a scholarship fund that would \nhelp girls to obtain a college education. Primarily, this fund \nwas to be used in recognition of high scholarship in secondary \nwork and in furthering similar attainments in college courses. \n\nClosely linked with this primary aim was the desire to \nmould opinions for the right among those groups in which \nfalse ideas as to innate inferiority were a heritage. \n\nBut the promoters of this project have been ever mindful \nof that fact that mere intellectual attainments and mental superiority \ncould not serve the purpose of advancing ideas of \ntruth and righteousness in the fullest measure. The club has \nbeen keenly alive to the great danger lurking in the desire \nto put a premium on high scholarship while losing sight of\nthe sine qua non of its real potency in life. One hears much \nthese days about the importance of intellectual attainments \nand the effort to bring to the front brilliant minds, but high \nmoral standards too often are being neglected as requirements. \nConsequently, the club in making its awards has \n\n19\n\ntried to take into consideration, the moral rectitude, the persistency, \nthe power to stand by in a situation and wrestle with it, \nthe self-reliance, and in general, the personality of the candidate. \nThe girls whose college careers the club sponsors must \nbe those who promise to be living and positive examples of \nhigh-minded womanhood. \n\nBut the full aims for which the scholarship fund was \nestablished can not be realized until the annual gift assumes \nlarger proportions. The cost of attending college has increased \nso much within the last decade, that what, in the beginning \nof our effort, would have borne a large part of a \nyear's expenses, is now not sufficient to encourage the girl \nwho is really in need of help. That is to say, the girl who is \ndependent on our help for going to college can not have the \nway made possible merely by the assistance which our small \ngift renders. Therefore, we are just now affording a little \nextra assistance to those who are already fairly well able to \nget along without it. \n \nWhat the club must do and will do, is establish an endowment \nfund large enough to yield annually such a proportion \nof a girl's yearly expenses in college that with a minimum \namount of self-help, her financial needs will be met entirely. \nSuch a plan would place our awards on a permanent \nbasis, and would afford opportunity to make our choice of \ncandidates coincide more nearly with our ideals. \n\nOrdinarily in life one finds it wiser to attack a difficult \nsituation with might and main without delay, to accomplish \nthe task at once rather than carry it around on the mind, doing \nonly a little at a time - never able to breathe the sigh \nof relief - well done. \n\nLet us apply the immediate effort here! Let the present \nscholarship fund multiply itself by four ere the club is  a\nyear older!\n\n    \n    ", "79", 159, 159, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-024:00436", "[*A Guide to Pictures- Coffin-The Art of Looking at\nPictures by Carl P Thurston\nFirst steps in the Enjoyment of Pictures by Oliver*]\n\n\noffice of director and, if delegates to an international congress are to be \nelected the following year, for the office of international delegate.

M. Forster\nHarcourt, Brace and Company, 383 Madison Ave., N. Y. \n\nSo much has been said about Foster's \"A Passage to \nIndia\" - so much about its literary strength, its universal appeal \nand its bewildering vividness, that I shall not attempt \nhere to touch upon these points. \n\nThere are but two phases of the book that I wish to \nstress. These are, the exquisite poetic flashes in Forster's \nprose, and the keen similarity shown between the race problems \nof the Anglo-Indian and those of the Afro-American. \n\nJust a tiny example of this poetic touch is given here:\n\"But when the sky chooses, glory can rain into the Chandrapore\nbazars, or a benediction pass from horizon to horizon. \nThe sky can do this because it is so strong and enormous. \nStrength comes from the sun, infused in it daily, size from \nthe prostrate earth.\"\n\nFor the second phase-that of similarity of racial problems, \nmay I say that never before did I quite sense the fact \nthat the American Negro's problem is a universal problem of \nrace adjustment, the question of a subject race, or one that  \nhas been subject, living in daily contact with its conquerors, \neach with intense feeling of distrust toward the other. When \nthe one kindly Englishman says to the tortured and embittered \nIndian - \"Why can't we be friends now? It is what I \nwant,\" the author answers: \"But the horses didn't want \nit-they swerved apart; the earth didn't want it; sending up\nrocks through which the riders must pass single file-the \ntemples, the tank, the jails, the palace, the birds, the carion, \nthe Guest House-they didn't want it; they said in their \nhundred voices-'No, not yet,' and the sky said, 'No, not\nthere.'\"\n\nWhy should one say more? Why should a mere enthusiast \nspoil the joy that will come to one from his own reading? Let \nthis be my conclusion. If you love nature-the sea-the \nsky-the open spaces-the terrible beauty of unexplored \ncaves-is you revel in the rippling beauty of musical words-\nif you believe in human nature and if your heart beats in unison \nwith the pathetic heart-throbs of other peoples-read this book!\n\nHALLIE E.

Parker, instructor in Biology at the Dunbar High \nSchool, Washington, D. C. \n\nThis monograph was first published in the American \nJournal of Botany (Volume 12-pp. 63-68, January, 1925).\n\nThese grasses were studied on Cedar (Moscow) Mountain, \nLatah County, Idaho and around the vicinity of the State \nof Washington. \n\nEspecial credit is given to Mr. Parker for individual studies \nmade by him as follows:\n1. The collection at the U. S. National Herbarium.\n2. The material in the New York Botanical Garden. \n3. Certain notations discovered by him on the type \nsheet of the Carex specimena in New York. \n\nThe result of the study is the discovery of a completely \nnew (un-named) genus of Carex, differing so from Carex \nconcinnoidea as to merit its placement in New Subgenus \nAltericarex, New Section-Tetragonae. \n\nMay we not call the attention of all botany lovers to \nthis distinctive work of Harold St. John and Charles S. Parker \nand may we not request that they become better acquainted \nwith our brilliant biologist, Mr. Parker. \n\nHALLIE E.

You may really make the mistake of believing\nthat in order to acquire knowledge, you must go to school and study books.\nIf anybody here really believes this, he is just as much in the dark \non the subject of twentieth century wisdom, as some of us were last winter,\nwho were trying to devise ways and means of putting coal into our\nbins.

Wrapping the drapery of his gloom about him, he must lie\ndown to nightmares of awful wickedness of the world at present and the\nprospective depravity of generations to come.

The figures available entirely refute this contention. \nOf the whites lynched the largest per cent, 46, were accused of \nmurder, while 8.4 per cent were accused of rape and \"attacks upon \nwomen.\" Of the negroes, 35.8 per cent were accused or murder and \n28.4 per cent of rape and \"attacks upon women.\" It is this to be \nseen that of the whole number of lynchings not more than 19 per \ncent of the victims were accused of rape, while the remaining 81 \nper cent were accused of other crimes or misdemeanors, or even of  \nno crime at all, the newspaper accounts being that some of these \nvictims had been guilty of no other offense than that of being \"lazy\"\nor exhibiting \"bad manners.\"\n\nWhile it appears that lynching is practiced in all parts of the \ncountry and upon both races and sexes, by far the greater number of \nvictims are of the negro race. The colored people accordingly are \nthe greatest sufferers from this form of lawlessness. They are \nparticularly distressed by the evil and they especially feel the need \nof protection from it. While the grievance is largely that of the \nnegroes, the shame is that of the whole Nation. It has now \nbeen 61 years since the negro was made a free man by Constitutional \namendment, 58 years since they were made citizens of the United \nStates, and 56 years since they were made voters by like provision. \nSo by the highest law of the land the negro is a free man, a citizen, \nand a voter. Although he has been in possession of these great \nrights for relatively so short a time he has shown himself to be \nworthy of them. As a free man he has always been amenable to \nreason and persuasion; as a citizen he has uniformly been a patriot, \nand as a voter he has consistently aligned himself with the intelligence, \nthe efficiency, the administrative ability, and the forces \nthat stand for order and property. What can be said of any \nother group of our fellow citizens? The negro is now a most \nefficient and essential factor in carrying on the productive industries \nof the country; and although he is new in many of these industries \nhe is showing a faithfulness and acquiring a skill worthy of all \ncommendation. There is now scarcely any calling, occupation, or \nprofession in which the negro is not showing a capacity and an \naptitude which challenges the respect and admiration of throughful \nmen. All of these facts taken in connection with the fact that he \nis a fellow human being should commend him to our sense of justice \nand fair play and entitle him to all of the benefits of law and order\nand civilization. \n\nAs he has been intimated in what has gone before, this question of\nlynching has an international aspect. Our State Department, in \nconducting the foreign relation of the Government wherein it is \nseeking redress from foreign governments on account of lawless \ndeprivations of American lives and property, has not infrequently \nto encounter the charge that the acts of which we complain against \nthe foreign nation are acts of common occurrence in this country, \nand that we have cleaned our own house we are estopped to\n \nTO PREVENT AND PUNISH THE CRIME OF LYNCHING \n\n5 \n\ncomplain of wrongs arising from like causes in other nations. These \nthings are thrown in our face in our relation with nations in our own \nWestern Hemisphere. It is not unusual for an American traveling \nabroad to encounter in newspapers and magazines of foreign countries \nthe most critical and humiliating comments upon the existence \nof lawlessness, lynching, and mob violence in this country. It is \nperfectly clear that the foreign public opinion created by these comments \naffect in some measure our international relations. Of late \nyears travelers in the Far East have observed the same phenomenon. \nThis fact can not but have an immense influence upon our relations \nwith the teeming millions in the Orient. Statesmen can not be \ninsensible to these facts and influences. They should admonish us\nto look carefully at internal conditions which are having such manifest \ninfluence in our foreign relations. \n\nThere are those who while they admit the national character of \nlynching and deplore its existence, yet oppose congressional action \ndealing with the subject for want of constitutional power. The \npower given Congress under section 4, article 4, of the Constitution \nof the United States to guarantee to each State a republican form of \ngovernment and the power contained in the fourteenth amendment \nare ample for this situation. It is scarcely conceivable that the \npower to guarantee a form of government does not carry with it \nthe corresponding duty to see that such government functions in \nlaw and order. The Supreme Court of the United States in numerous \ndecisions has held that the power to guarantee a republican form \nof government is a political power to be exercised by Congress.\n(See Luther v. Borden, 7 Howard 1; Texas v. White, 7 Wallace 730; \nand Pacific States Tel. Etc., Co. v. Oregon, 223 U. S. 118.) It is \nnot likely that the Supreme Court would annul legislation enacted \nin pursuance of a political power and not in the mere exercise of a \npolice power. Under the fourteenth amendment the failure or \ninability of a State to assure every citizen the equal protection of \nthe law and due process of law should be the same thing as to deny \nhim affirmatively these rights. \n\nIt seems that there has been some decrease in the yearly number \nof lynchings since 1921. The indications are, however, that such \ndecrease has been due to agitation, movements of population, scarcity \nof labor in some sections of the country, and the fear of \nthe loss of labor supply in other sections of the country. One of the \nmist disquieting occurrences of recent months has been the fact that \na negro charged with the crime of murder in Mississippi and acquitted \nthereof by a court of competent jurisdiction was taken from \nthe court room by a mob and lynched after said acquittal. Since \nthen, although the local authorities undertook the prosecution of the \nlynchers, they have since dropped it, presumably for want of support \nin local public opinion. It thus appears that all of the facts \nconverge to support the contention that the Nation itself has a duty \nin this situation and that that duty is to remove the blot of lynching \nfrom its escutcheon. \n\n85065---26--------2\n    \n", "98", 165, 165, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-023:00240", "And what can one say of those\nwonderful soldiers of the 10th Cavalry who\nbehaved so heroically at the recent engagement \nat Carrizal- ?

From the many\nevils born of prejudive and proscription, the Negro may be learning less\nwhich could be taught him in no other way and he may be gaining strength\nwhich could come to him form no other source. There is no doubt that Ne-\ngroes all over the country are more united and have more respect for each\nother than they did twenty years ago.  Having been taught during slavery\nto despise each other and put a low estimate upon any thin a white man\ndid, after their emancipation they did not immediately recover from this\nfeeling of contempt which they had always felt for their own,  and I am\nnot perfectly sure that they are entirely cure yet.  For instance, ten or\nfifteen years ago ,  what is called the best class of colored people avoud\nnot have been persuaded to emplo a colored physician, because they had no\nconfidence in his skill. In all our large cities to day,  however,  colored\nphysicians are well patronized by their own people,  who are even beginnig\nto think that they can cure them better and quicker than anybody else.\nColored people are everywhere employing their own tradesmen more, are gra\ngradually gaining more confidence in their professionalmen and are deal-\ning more and more at the colored stores/\nThe lesson of unity is being slowly, but surely learned, and nothing im-\npresses its utility upon us more than the very prejudice whoch forces\nus to take refuge among ourselves. A practical working our of this princi\npal is well illustrated in the following instance.  A few years ago it be\ncame noised abroad that  white dentists were unwilling to serve colored\npatients. As a result of this rumor, scores of y oung colored men took\nup the profession of dentistry and settles in those sections, where this\nspirit was manifest.  To day they are making money, hand over fist, simply\nbecause their own people are forced to patronize them. Now these experi\nences are bitter and hard for us to bear,  but they nevertheless teach us\nlessons which we must sooner or later learn.  Personally I always feel", "14", 165, 165, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-023:00241", "21\n\nlike lifting my heart in gratitude to the good people of the dominant \nrace for that exhibition of their prejudice which puts money into the \nblack man's pocket and affords him an opportunity of providing to his own \npeople that he can give us as good satisfaction as anybody else, if he only \nhas the chance. \nThe opinion is frequently expressed that the Negro can never hope to occupy \nin this country a position of dignity and respect among other races \nbecause he is descended form slaves. But this argument loses both point \nand force, when we remember that the Anglo Saxon, himself, from whom \nsome pretty good families in this country have descended, once bowed under \na yoke of bondage as bitter and galling as that under which our African \nancestors groaned. If History teaches one lesson more than another, \nit is that races wax and wane. The conqueror made laud it over his subject \nfor a while, but he is himself conquered in the end. So far as I have \nbeen able to ascertain from the study of History, with but a single exception, \nand that a very small one, no race of people has ever lived upon \nthe face of the earth which has not at some time in its history, been \nthe subject of a stronger. In being descended from slaves, therefore, the \nNegro is no exception to a general rule. \nIf anyone should ask me what special phase of the Negro's development \nmakes me most hopeful of his ultimate triumph over present obstacles, I \nshould answer unhesitationgly it is the magnificent work the women are \ndoing to regenerate and uplift the race. No people need ever despair, \nwhose women are fully aroused to the responsibility resting upon them \nand are willing to shoulder responsibilities which they alone can successfully \nassume.\nBut the dark side of the problem, you say. What of that? Would you comfort \nus with the delusion that there is none, in spite of the facts. \nWould you close our ears to the wail of anguish and sorrow which goes up \nalmost daily from hundred of black men all over the country because of \n\n\n\n22\n\ncruelty of which savages should be ashamed? Would you close our eyes to \nferocity and barbarity which burn at the stake, shoot to death and flay \nalive men and women, whose only crime as the color of their skin? \nWould you tell mothers and fathers from whom employment is held because \nthey are black, while their children go hungry and scantily fed that this \ncountry is just and their prospects are bright? If I would, I could not \ndeceive a single man or woman, who has ears to hear and eyes to see tragedies \nenacted daily, which are a stain upon this country's honor and a \nblot upon her fair name.\nAlas there is a side to this race problem, which is as black as Erebus, \nas wicked as sin and as bitter as gall. But in admitting this to be true, \nI am reminded of a time, and not so long ago either, but that some in \nthis audience may remember it well, when the Negro's lot was harded and \nhis prospect much gloomier than they are to day. Forty years ago hundred \nof slave mothers mourned and could not be comforted, because their children \nwere sold away. They little dreamed they would live to see the day, \nwhen a colored woman could clasp her child to her bosom and call it her \nown. And yet, this and much more than this happened with the short space \nof a few years. Why, then, should a race in whose name and for whose sake \nsuch miracles have been performed, look forward to the future with despair? \"\nAh,\" says one, \"do you not know that the Negro's lot is harded \nas a freedman than it was as a slave?\" Such a comment as this upon the \nNegro's present status is made from time to time, I know. But, surely, it \ncould not come from a man or a woman who has any idea of what slavery was \nor who has a realizing sense of the awful throes through which this country \npasses in order to make the Negro a man. For the emancipation of the \nslave and his career in this country since the way are miracles just as \nastounding and just as great as was the conversion of water into wine. \nOne has only to review the Negro's history in this country since 1865 to \ndrive away despair.

Her \nspirits flagged so perceptibly that her mother became somewhat alarmed \nand urged her to accept an invitation extended by a friend in New York to \nspend a week with her at Easter. After the various pros and cons had been \npresented by Miss Collier and her mother, the question was finally \nsettled in the affirmative.                                      \nThe young lady decided to start the day before Christmas [Easter] and preparations \nfor the visit began at once. The kind of gowns, how many new and how many \nold was agreed upon, the number of hate determined and then the attention \nof the two women turned to the question of trunks. \"The old one will be \nall right, if it is repaired,\" said the daughter, and the telephone was \npressed into service without delay. The man who answered the call promised \nto send for the trunk right away, but he was positive that it could \nnot be finished [until] before Saturday Christmas. Even if it could be repaired so soon as , the day before Easter, on account of the unusual rush.\nThe morning the two young men were to start on their pleasure trip, Stowell \nrushed into Carson's room in the greatest glee. His mood quickly\nchanged, however, when he saw that his friend had apparently made no preparation\nfor the journey at all. \"Here it is\", said he, \"after nine o'clock,\nand there is nothing to indicate that you are even thinking about taking\na trip. The train leaves at noon, too. What's the matter with you anyhow?\"\nCarson laughed at his friend's impatience and begged him to take a seat.\n\"Dont be in such a rush, Jack,\" he said pleasantly. \"There's a plenty of time\nI've sent my trunk to be repaired and it has not come back from the shop.\nI'm expecting it every minute. It will be here soon, I know, and it wont\ntake me a minute to pack. Then we'll call a cab and get to the station in\na jiffy. I haven't had my breakfast yet and I must take a bite.

I haven't carried a trunk anywhere \n\n\n4\n\nfor a short trip, since I was a small boy in kilts.\"\nThe two men had hardly turned the corner, before the much discussed trunk\narrived and was safely deposited in Carson's room. \"Well, I'm glad this\nthing has come at last,\" said Stewell, as his eye fell upon the trunk,\nwhen they returned. \"But where on earth did it come from\", demanded Carson\nin surprise. \"From the shop where you sent it for repairs, of course,\"\nreplied Stowell. \"But it isn't my trunk\", insisted Carson. For a minute\nStowell's face was a puzzle. It was difficult to decide whether he was\nangry or amused. \"If you go on like this much longer, Arthur, you'll be\nsitting in some lunatic asylum soon, and no mistake.

He had removed two trays, when his eyes fell upon\nsomething in the bottom, which made him stop as though he had been shot.\n\"Do you see snakes, Arthur?\" asked his friend. Paying no attention to the\nremark Carson steeped and picked something up to which his eyes were fairly\nglued. It was a letter, which he quickly read. Before he had finished\nit, he dropped into a chair as though he had received an electric shock.\n\"If that is not your trunk, why on earth does that letter interest you so\nmuch?\" asked Stowell. \"Come, hurry up, Arthur, put that letter down and\nthrow your clothes into that trunk.\"\nIt seemed difficult for Carson to collect himself sufficiently to reply.\n\"You'll have to go to Philadelphia without me today, Jack.

He says there will\nbe great times in that little village right after Easter and that I must\ncome without fail to join in the sport. He wants you to come too. Now\nbrace up and say yes. You can arrange to take a little vacation, just as\nwell as I can. We'll leave here the day before Easter, Saturday morning. Sur[e]\nCarson insisted at first that he could not possibly leave his business\nbefore or after Easter, but Stowell would not take No for an answer and so the\nmatterwas settled.\n\"My trunk will have to be repaired\", said Carson aloud, when his friend\nhad gone, \"and I must send it tomorrow to the shop. I guess I am a little\ncracked in the upper story, just as Jack says, or I would not change my\nmind so often. I had just decided to take a trip soon to steady my nerves\nbefore he proposed going to Philadelphia, and now that I have promised to\ngo away, I am more wretched than I was before. But I'll go just the same,\nhave a gay time and forget that such a queer, unreasonable creature as woman \nexists.\" If a very poor student of human nature had looked closely at \nCarson's face, as he uttered this remark, he would have doubted that\nyoung man's power to keep the resolution which he had just made.\nAs times wore on, some of Alice Collier's friends began to suspect that she\nwas more deeply touched by her broken engagement than they had at first\nsupposed.

A British general came to New York the\nother day and when he heard about the Patriotic League he said:  \"I wish\nevery girl in the United States would join in memory of Jenny Lanning\", \nand then he told her story.  Jenny Lanning was a little shop girl in London,\nvery young, very anxious to do her bit, but not quite seeing what she\ncould do. \nOne day she called all the women in the shop together and\nsaid,  \"Girls, let's adopt the families of one of the companies at the\nfront.\"  Think what it meant to those men to hear that the girls were going\nto look after their children and cheer up their wives.  They wanted to \nshow their appreciation, so they took a shell that had been fired at them, \nmade a ring and sent it to Jenny, but she never knew about the ring\nbecause the day before it reached London she was killed by a bomb from\na Zeppelin while she was befriending some of these children.

From that \nviewpoint we do think that a measure of this kind should prevail \nfor the purpose of checking that group of men that would lose their \ntemper and would forget themselves and attempt to take the law \nin hand, and by so doing I think it is an established fact that the \ninnocent at times have suffered because of undue haste.\n\nNow. gentlemen of the committee, to be brief and just to sum   \nit all up in a nutshell, this is a matter that should claim the attention \nof the American people to the extent that we should not permit anything \nin the way of a breaking down of the law, the taking of the \nlaw in hand by some individual or mob. We have elected to office  \nmen who are sworn to carry out the law, and we as American \npeople should not permit these things to happen, that would take \naway from those who are duly elected the right and duty to execute \nthe laws,, and permit that power and authority to go over into the \nhands of those who are not so elected and responsible. \n\nIn closing, I feel that this committee is cognizant of the fact \nthat it is not a reflection upon just one person, or any group of \npersons, but it is a reflection upon the entire American nation to \nsit idly by and not do something that would check those who would \ntake into their own hands, regardless of law, the execution of their \nown wishes in connection with other American citizens. \n\nOf course, some people think this matter affects the colored people \nalone. The sinner is heartless, sin is blind, going from bad to \nworse. It may start out on some weaker person or weaker group, \nbut if it is permitted to go on it is going to stick its fangs into all \nit comes in contact with. \n\nSome mention was made of conditions during the World War, \nand mention was made of the Herrin massacre. I should like to \nsay that we had in Springfield, Mo., a lynching-not of a black \nman, but of a white man, and for that reason I do not think anyone \nshould view this proposition as being confined to the colored \npeople. It is a subject that should concern the American people as \na whole, as an evil that is growing, or liable to grow even though \nthe statistics may show that it has been reduced somewhat in recent \nyears. Unless there is some curb to it no one can tell just where it \nmay stop. \n\nI believe that is all I care to say at this time, and I thank you, \ngentlemen of the committee. \n\nSenator KING (presiding).

Come forward, please, and give to the \nshorthand reporter your name and address. \n\nTO PREVENT AND PUNISH THE CRIME OF LYNCHING \n\n39 \n\nSTATEMENT OF JAMES L. NEILL, RECORDING SECRETARY OF THE \nNATIONAL EQUAL RIGHTS LEAGUE, WASHINGTON, D. C.\n\nMr. NEILL. I represent the National Equal Rights League, as \nrecording secretary. I wish to simply refer to what I consider \nthe strongest influence that should cause the action which is \nnow proposed against lynching, and that is the public sentiment of \nthe South itself has so changed that lynching has become even in \nthe South a thing that is despised and hated. \n\nThe interracial movement in the South, whereby the best elements \nof the two races meet together and discuss racial conditions, is a \nmanifestation of the fact that a change of public sentiment has taken \nplace. It has shown that questions affecting the negro can be discussed \nby the representatives of both races. \n\nAnd then, too, the women of the South, who have been especially \nheld up as the cause of mob law and lynchings, these women themselves \nhave come out and publicly declared that no longer would \nthey stand for that excuse for this unreasonable crime. \n\nIn the pulpit in the South the sentiment against lynching and \nmob law is equally strong. It seems to me that when the sentiment \nhas become so changed in the South, and when we add to that \na sentiment that has always been strong in the North, the Congress, \nand the Senator who has in hand this particular bill, should be \ninspired that he and they have the sentiment of the Nation in his \nand their favor. \n\nI wish to refer to the fact that lynching can be prevented: it only \nneeds the strong arm of the law to bring about prevention. You will \nrecall that-\n\nSenator KING (interposing). As I interpret your statement, you \nthink that the diminution-and that seems to be borne out by the \nfigures submitted by Mr. Johnson-in the crime of lynching is due\nto a growth in public sentiment against lynching. Now, if that \nsentiment shall continue-and every decent and patriotic citizen \nof this country, of course, feels that it should continue-and no \ndoubt they all feel, as they should feel, that it should be compelling-\nit is only a question of a very short time when this crime will \nbe effaced entirely from our country. \n\nMr. NEILL. I hope so. And I would hope that there might neve r\nbe another lynching anywhere in the Untied States. But why wait \nand hope for the influence of public sentiment and let other innocent \nvictims be lynched? While we are waiting for public sentiment \nto so crystallize that it will remove lynching other victims will \nhave suffered, and the good name of this Nation will suffer in the \neyes of the world. I had in mind to add that public sentiment \ncrystallized in the form of law is but public opinion expressed in \na form that will bind all of the public. \n\nSenator KING. Generally speaking, do you think that the Federal \nGovernment is more effective in enforcing the law than the States?\nI might remind you that the Federal Government has been trying \nfor years to enforce the prohibition law, and while I shall not \ncomment on its successes or its failures, for the situation is a matter\nof general information, yet these and many other offenses have \n", "115", 164, 164, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-002:00755", "the 57th heaven.

I might say that I believe if the prohibition law had \nbehind it a strong public sentiment it would and could be enforced. \nThe trouble is that public sentiment is not behind it. \n\nSenator KING. Then the question comes back to public sentiment \nas the great curative agency with reference to the evils in the land. \n\nMr. NEILL. Yes, sir; I think our laws are but an expression of \npublic sentiment. \n\nSenator KING (presiding). You may continue your statement. \n\nMr. NEILL. I was saying that it has been demonstrated lynching \ncan be prevented and was about to state an instance recently in \nLouisville, Ky., where the militia was called out by the governor \nto protect the accused during his trial. There was present a mob \nof something like five thousand people about the court house, and \nyet, under that protection which any person, white or black, \nshould have, if need be, no attempt at lynching was made. My point \nis that although in States like Kentucky there might be no need \nfor any antilynching bill, yet in many States, like Mississippi, for \ninstance, it has been shown to be needed. In Mississippi a lynching \ntook place and the participants were apprehended and brought to\ntrial, but a jury refused to convict them, although they knew they \nwere guilty. It is in just such cases that Federal legislation should \ncome in, and by proper provision compel a State to protect an accused; \nwherever there is laxity in the enforcement of the law, or \nlack of protection of the accused, the Federal Government should\nstep in and accord that protection and save the lives of its citizens. \n\nI believe if this proposition were submitted to a vote of the people, \nas were the two recent amendments, that it would be shown the \npeople are strongly in favor of just the thing we are here to consider-\nsome kind of Federal enactment that will protect the lives \nof innocent victims or persons accused of crime and give them an \nopportunity of trial, guaranteed to them by the Constitution. \n\nIn this connection, the main thought that I have is that all of \nthis paraphernalia of the courts in the South are in the hands of \nthe southerners, and there is no danger of an accused escaping. \nAnd when you consider that fact, it makes the crime of lynching all  \nthe more reprehensible, because wherever one is accused of crime and \nis apprehended, all that is necessary is for him to be taken into \ncourt, and, as was the case recently-only last week, I believe-\nwithin about give minutes he as convicted and sentenced to be \nhanged. So that situation proves to us that there is the greatest \ninhumanity, yes, brutality, and almost barbarism on the part of \nthose who engage in lynching, and that it can only be stopped by the \nstrong hand of Federal law. And it seems to be that every argument \nfrom that standpoint is in favor of just the kind of legislation \nthat is now being considered by your committee. \n    \nGentlemen, I wish to thank you for your consideration. \n\nSenator KING (presiding). Who will you have next?  \n\nSenator McKINLEY. Next will be Mr. Clarke. \n\nSenator KING (presiding). Come forward and state your name \nand whom you represent. \n\nTO PREVENT AND PUNISH THE CRIME OF LYNCHING \n\n41\n\nSTATEMENT OF THOMAS H. R. CLARKE, OF THE NATIONAL EQUAL \nRIGHTS LEAGUE, WASHINGTON, D. C. \n\nMr. CLARKE. My name is Thomas H. R. Clarke, and I am a \nmember of the National Equal Rights League. \n\nSenator KING. You may proceed with your statement. \n\nMr. CLARKE. The reason I am here to-day, Senators, is because \nthe colored people, especially in the South, are not in a position to \nprotect themselves. If they were in a position to protect themselves \nwe would not be here to-day asking you to enact this bill. And \nthe colored people of the South are not in position to protect themselves \nbecause they have been stripped of every civil and political \nright guaranteed them in the great reconstruction acts. And they \nhave been in that weakened political condition for nearly 50 years. \n\nIn spite of the immense properties which they have acquired \nduring the last 40 years and the large amount of taxes which they \npay in every southern State to help support those States in their \ngovernmental functions, the colored people of the South have no \nrepresentation in their State legislatures. They are denied the right \nto hold office, and in most of the southern States they are denied the \nright to sit on juries, with the result that if a colored man in any \ncommunity in the South is even charged with crime some man who  \nmay have personal enmity against him is likely to be able to convict \nhim, with the result that even a charge is almost equivalent to \nconviction. And if such a man or some of his friends should get \ntogether to resent the charge, he or they may be lynched, and the \nperpetrators of the crime will go unwhipped of justice. \n\nThe particular think I desire to say, and then I will close, is this:\nA bill similar to this passed the House of Representatives before. \nMr. Dyer, who is a personal friend of mine, and whom I have known \nfor many years, for we worked in the same office at one time before \nhe became a Member of Congress; I say Mr. Dyer worked in season \nand out of season with his contemporaries in the House, convincing \nmany of them of the constitutionality of his measure, and, in time, \nhe was enabled to get enough converts to his view of the constitutionality \nof the measure to give him an opportunity to pass it in \nthe House. It finally came to the Senate. It was then referred to a \nsubcommittee and it remained in the jurisdiction of that subcommittee, \nfor no report was ever made. And we understood, our delegations \nunderstood, that the reason the subcommittee made no report \nwas because there were gentlemen on that subcommittee who had to \nbe convinced about the constitutionality of the measure.\n\nIn conclusion, Senators, I say this: I have read the debates in the\nCommittee on Reconstruction when Thaddeus Stevens was chairman \nof the committee and when the fourteenth amendment was being \nframed, and they very comprehensively did two things: Prior to the \nenactment of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution there \nwas only one kind of citizenship in the United States, and that was \nState citizenship. But Thaddeus Stevens and other men of that committee \nsaid: We must make a dual citizenship. We must make a \nman not only a citizen of the State in which he lives, but a citizen of \nthe United States, in order that the Federal Government may protect \nhim if his life, his liberty, or his property is invaded.

This thing of a woman's immolating herself upon\nthe altar of her children and her home and never going out for reacreation \nand enjoyment herself is all a mistake. It's tommy rot of the worst\nkind.\"      Mrs. Jack Hansom spoke with conviction and feeling. She was\nno longer young in years, but was a girl in heart and was much more active\nthan many women twenty years her junior. She had successfully reared a\nfamily of six, evenly divided, three boys and three girls, each and every\none of whom had \"turned out well\", as her friends expressed it. The girls\nhad married men to whom their parents did not object, to say the least.\nTwo of the Hansom boys were in the professions and one was a prosperous\n\n2\nbusiness man. Nobody had accused Mrs. Hansom of staying at home too much.\nShe had been a pioneer in establishing Day Nurseries for the children of\nworking women, had been a member of the Trustee Board which had supervised\nthe Home for Friendless Girls and had devised ways and means of sending\nmore than one talented girl to college and to schools of art.\n\"I recall very distinctly\" said Mrs. Hansom, \"that Mrs. Shepherd frequently expressed the strongest disapproval of women who belonged to clubs,\nand she was evidently conscientious in this point of view. Well, she\nhas my deepest sympathy anyway. Who knows what Bob Shepherd really did?\nWhat is the state of the case as it now stands?\"\nIt seems\" said Mrs. Gifford, \"that he belonged to a gang of boys\nof his own age, from fifteen to twenty years, who were actually banded\ntogether for the purpose of robbing stores. It is wonderful how well they\nsucceeded, too. At least two of the five boys came from the best families\nand Bob Shepherd was one of them. The other three who composed the \ngang belonged to respectable families, too. They committed the thefts\nfrom two to four in the morning.\"\n\"How on earth did a boy so carefully watched and guarded as Bob Shepherd\nalways has been elude the vigilance of his mother?\" interrupted\nMrs. Hansom. \"I have heard Mrs. Shepherd say several times that a mother\nshould rarely go out at night, so as to see that her children, particularly\nher boys, were in the house at the proper time and that regularly every\nnight her son retired at ten o'clock. It simply shows\", she concluded\n\"that even a vigilant, dutiful, mother must slepp a little. She can not\nlie awake all night long to see that her son does not slip out of the\nfront door or let himself out of the window at two in the morning for the\npurpose of robbing stores, or committing other crime.\"\n\"There are two young men I have in mind\" said Mrs. Duncan, who had no \nchildren of her own.

Neither one of\nthem cares a fig for liquor, altho they have seen their father consume \nit in large quantities, ever since they were born. With such a shocking\nexample before them, how do you account for their sobriety? How is it \nthat they were not tempted by their father's example to become a victim\nof strong drink? Its my opinion\", she added,\"that their father was an \nawful warning to them. Instead of being tempted to follow in his footsteps, \nthey were disgusted with him.\"\n \"It simply proves,\" sighed Mrs. Gifford, \"That what is one child'd\nmeat is another's poison. There are Mrs. Bayard's children, two girls\nand two boys. You know what an inveterate, incurable missionary that\ngood woman has been all her life, how she has absented herself from home,\noccasionally even going on extended tours, providing for her children,\nof course, as best she could, and yet those girls and boys have apparently \nnot suffered from what seemed to me, pure and unadulterated neglect\nat all.\"\n\"Hear then the conclusion of the whole matter\" said a rosy-checked young\nmatron who had listened in silence to the discussion practically the\nwhole afternoon.\" We have examples of children who have turned out well,\nbrilliantly, in spite of the fact that their mothers found time either\nto be missionaries or do some other kind of work outside of their homes.,\nwhile their children were young and growing up. On the other hand, children \nhave brought shame and disgrace upon their parents in spite of the\nfact that their mothers devoted their whole time and attention to them.\n It seems to me that each child is a problem unto itself. Each mother\nmust decide for herself what is her duty to her children and to her home.\nNobody else can settle that question for her. I\n         If a mother seems to have a \"call\" to help the little waifs and\nstrays for whom so little is done. in addition to rearing her own brood,\n\n\n\n                                                    4\nit seems to me it is her duty to do that, If a woman does not care to do\nmissionary work, or if she prefers to amuse herself occasionally, why\nlet her do that..\" But \"fools rush in, where angels fear to tread, \"\nsaid the young matron with a blush and a smile, \"so here I am expressing \nan opinion on subjects which those who have had more experience can\ndiscuss so much better than myself.\"   \"No, a little child can lead us\"\nreplied Mrs. Hansom. \"But the conclusion of the whole matter is that a\nmother can do only so much for a child and no more. I used formerly\nto believe almost wholly in a child's training- in his environment-and\nhad a fine scorn for heredity. Now I believe in both. Experience and observation \nhave taught me that no matter how much may be done for some\nchildren or how little may be done for others, what is in the child is\nmore then apt to come out- the mother's example, devotion, her most conscientious efforts to the contrary, notwithstanding.\"\n\"But what a discouraging point of view\", exclaimed Mrs. Gifford, . \"What\ncan mothers do then?\" \" Their best, my dear,\" replied Mrs. Hansom, \"their\nvery best, and the child must do the rest. There is at least one thing\nwomen can do however, and that is to refrain from always laying upon a\nmother the burden of her children's failures, and to saddle the blame for\ntheir evil deeds solely upon her. There is no doubt that some mothers do\nneglect their children and their homes, but the children of such mothers\ndo not always turn out badly, on the contrary, they frequently do very \nwell. On the same principle children of mothers who have devoted themselves\nheart, soul, mind and strength to their rearing and training sometimes\nfall sadly from grace, and instead of being a credit to their parents\nare a disgrace. In cases like these let us be slow to hold the mothers\naccountable, as is usually done. Have you observed, friends?\" she asked\n\" that we have not said one word about the father's responsibility in the\nrearing of children? But- this is too serious a discussion for an afternoon\ntea.

I wd like to say The rights of the c r\nwere incorporated by the R.P in a civil treaty\nright after the war which we call the 14 &\n15 amendments of the constitution of the US\nand ever since the R P incorporated the\nrights of the c r into the constitution of the US\nthe Dem Party has done everything in its\npower to make them null & void.

How stupid we would \nbe if we really believed such a promise as that one when right here \nin the United States where that Party is supporting the treaty fifteen \nloyal patriotic citizens are not and can not enjoy equal rights. \n\nWe are told also \"the treaty of Versailles was signed by the negro \nrepresentatives of Haiti and Liberia, and by the American peace \ndelegates in representation of our twelve million colored citizens.\" \nIf President King of Liberia or the representatives of Haiti tried \nto travel through that section where the Democrats have their strongest \nhold they would be forced to ride in Jim-Crow cars.

When he discovered I was not with him, he came running back to find me. the brakeman saw him coming and beat a hasty retreat. He had intended to force me into the little cubby hole set aside for colored people.\nI had another tast of the Jim Crow arrangement when I was about sixteen years old and was coming from Oberlin college to spend my vacation in Memphis. I had to change cars in Bowling Green, Kentucky, and when I had detrained I asked a porter who was standing on the platform which car I should take for Memphis. As soon as I had entered the one to which he direct me, I observed that it was different from any coach I had ever seen, It was a regular day coach divided into two parts- the front being used as a smoker for white men and the rear half serving as a coach for colored women and men.\nInstantly I knew this was the Jim Crow coach which I had never seen but about which I had often heard. I realized that I had been trapped and I resolved that I would not remain in it. I tried to leave it and go into the car ahead of me, but the conductor barred the way. When he came through the Jim Crow car to collect the tickets, I told him I did not want to remain in the coach to which the porter had directed me, and that I wished he would give me a seat in the coach ahead. The conductor sternly informed me that I was int eh coach to which I belonged. \"But I have a first class ticket, \"I protested, \"and this is not a first class coach.\"\n\"This is first class enough for you,\" he replied sarcastically, \"and you stay just where you are,\" with a look calculated to freeze the very marrow of my bones. I tried hard to compose myself and decide to remain where I was. I kept telling myself that changing cars was not worth the fight for it I would undoubtedly have to make.\nI had entered the Jim Crow car in the afternoon, and it was well\n264\nfilled for several hours. But, as the evening came on, the number of passengers dwindled until I was the only one left. I had to travel all night, and when I thought that during the whole night or even a part of it I might be in that car alone at the mercy of the conductor or any man who entered, I was frightened and horrified. As young as I was, I had heard about awful tragedies which had overtaken colored girls who had been obliged to travel alone on these cars at night.\nI dicided to ask the conductor once more to allow me to go into the coach ahead. But he was obdurate. When I told him how frightened I would e with nobody in the car but myself during the night or a portion of it, he assured me with a significant look that he himself would keep my company and remain in there with me. \"I should much rather be left to myself,\" I summoned courage enough to reply, \"than to have you stay with me.\" By that time I was so agitated I felt that anything would be preferable to remaining alone in that car with the conductor during the night, even death itself. But what could I do! All at once I made up my mind to leave the train. I had heard the conductor announce that the next stop would be Erie, Tennessee, where passengers going to certain destinations would have to change cars. I decided I would get off there, wire my plight to my father and await instructions from him.\nI was well aware that I was taking a desperate chance. I knew that any colored girl would run a great risk of having an unpleasant experience or of falling into danger of some kind by getting off at night at a strange town in the South, where she was acquainted with nobody and where she might have difficulty in finding a decent place to stay. But, of the two evils, I decided that leaving the train was less. When we reached Erie, therefore, I took my valise and started toward the door. But the conductor was there before me and refused to let me pass.\n\"What are you going to do?\" he asked. \"I am getting off here,\" I replied, \"and I'll wire my father that you are forcing me to ride all night in a Jim Crow car. He will sue the railroad for compelling his daughter who has a first class ticket to ride in a  second class car.\" \"Do you know where you are going?\" he inquired. \"Do you require all your passengers who leave the train to tell you their", "8", 171, 171, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00281", "265\nbusiness?\" I countered.\nWhen the conductor saw how agitated I was and how determined I was not to remain on the train, his manner toward me changed completely. He tried to wrench my valise from my hand, but I held on to it with a vice like grip. Seeing he was attracting the attention of some of the passengers he let go of my valise and said, \"You can go ahead into that car, if you want to.\" By the time I had found a seat in the center of the first class coach I was on the verge of collaspe, but I possessed sufficient self control not to burst into tears. When we reached Memphis the next morning, my father was walking up and down the platform wating for the train. I saw the conductor speak to him and Father told me afterward that he inquired \"Are you wainting for your daughter, sir? She's right in there.\" \"pointing to the first class coach.\nAt that time the Jim Crow cars had not been legalized in the State of Tennessee and colored people who bought first class tickets could get first class accommodations, if they insisted upon their rights, without violating the state law. At present, how ever, when colored people holding first class tickets are thrust into the dirty, stuffy coaches set aside for them which lack proper accommodations for the two sexes, they are obliged to stay in them, because they are told these are first class for them and it is against the law for them to ride in the coach with white people. Those who maintain that conditions are growing better for colored people in the South might do well to consider how much more seriously they are handicapped to day when they travel in that section than they were thirty or forty years ago.\nThe first time I realised the ordeal through which colored women pass who are stranded at night in a strange city was when I was travelling from Shreveport, Louisianna to Paris, Texas. I had boarded the coach for white people at Shreveport, when I started early in the morning, because I knew I would have to ride all day. The agent who sold me the ticked assured me that the train I was \n266\ntaking would go straight through from Shreveport to Paris and that I would reach my destination that night.\nWhen I learned that I would be on the road all day, I remembered what had happened to me on a previous occasion. I left Hot Springs, Ark. one morning about five o'clock to go to Fort Smith, when I boarded the train I had eaten nothing since I had my dinner about six the night before. I had gone into the Jim Crow car at Hot Springs, and had been unable to get a morsel of food all day long. When I reached Fort Simth that night, therefore, I had not eaten for twenty four hours. For that reason I resolved that in the future, if I knew I would be travelling all day in the South, I would board a first class coach, when I started on my journey, so that it would be possible for me to get the service and the necessaries which passengers require.\nThis trip to Paris, Texas proved the wisdom of that course. A short while before the train reached Texarkana, Arkansas, the conductor, who had talked to me several times en route, came to tell me that the train would not go through to Paris, as the agent in Shreveport had stated, but that it would be cut off in the city which we would soon reach. I was terribly upset by this news. \"What shall I do?\" I asked in bewilderment. \"I am acquainted with no one here. Where can I stop to night?\"\nThe conductor treated my dismay and confusion as a joke and replied, \"Why, you can stop at a hotel, of course. As much as you have traveled, surely you must have stopped at a hotel.\" Up to that night it had never occurred to me to attempt to stop at a hotel for white people in the South. The very suggestion from the conductor shocked and appalled me. Before I stopped to think, therefore, I said impulsively, \"Why, I can't stop at a hotel in Texarkana.\" \"Certainly you can,\" said he emphatically. \"Why not?\" There's a fine hotel just across from the station.\"\nBy that time the train had stopped.

We [*want*] try to help it in\nevery way we can. And I want to impress upon you to night that the time\nhas come for those who really love their country to help it. There have\nbeen crucial times before in the [history] life of this nation. No doubt about\nthat. But never before in the history of this country, has it been more\n\n\n\n2\n\nnecessary for those who love it and wish it well to try to continue in\npower that party which will most faithfully promote its welfare and\nminister to its needs. Never before has it been more necessary to continue\nin power the Republican party which [*has proved again and again that it can*] can \nundoubtedly serve it best.\n\nNobody can truthfully deny that the United States of America owes the\ncommanding position it now occupies among the nations of the earth to\nthe wise and successful administration of the Republican Party.\nAs you know, the Republican party was formed in 1866. Since then there\nhave been [*only*] two Democratic presidents. Grover Cleveland who served two\nterms and Woodrow Wilson who served two terms. In other words the Democrats\nhave been in power only 16 out of  58 [*62*] years.\n\n[And] Well what did the Democratic party do, while it was in power those 16\nyears? It came just as near wrecking the country as it [*possibly*] could and if\nthere were sufficient time to review its record of omission and commission expose its sins and\nrecite its mistakes, it would be easy to prove this fact. It is a pity\nthat, as a race, we have to think so much about the attitude of parties\nand men to our own particular group. We are only human, however, and self\npreservation is the first law of nature [as] as truly with us as it is with\nother divisions of the human family. But, before we consider the attitude\nof either party toward [the] colored people [of this country] let us see what effect the administrations \nof the Democratic and the Republican parties ha[s]ve had upon the\ncountry as a whole. There is not sufficient time to enter into any profound\ndiscussion of the tariff to show [what] [*how disastrous has been the*] effect of the Democratic administration\n[has had] upon the well being of [*all*] the citizens of this country without\nregard to either race or sex. As a rule, the Republican Party has [*always*]\n        [*1         3      2      4*]\nstood for prosperity, while poverty and hunger have usually followed in\nthe Democratic wake.\n\nLet us briefly cite just a few cases to prove this fact.

'During the long service.' said Mrs. Terrell,\n'his record was a good one and now he is dismissed summarily while\ndeclaring his innocence and his belief that the other members of the\nbattalion are not guilty as charged.'\n\n\"Mrs. Terrell said she was much impressed with the demeanor of\nboth the men and during the conversation asked them to explain why\nempty cartridges, such as are used in the army, were found in Brownville\nafter the trouble. To this both Saunders and Brown replied\nthat it was an easy matter for cartridges belonging to the military\nstores to be procured by outsiders. Mrs. Terrell said she assured\nSuanders and Brown that the Constitution League of New York, of which\nshe is a member, will do all in its power to see that they are given\na hearing in an effort to secure reinstatement.\n\n\"Mrs Terrell commented on the fact that the men seemed to harbor\nno resentment toward any one who had been connected in any way\nwith the investigation which lead to their summary dismissal from\nthe army. On the contrary, they said they hoped and believed they\nwould be given justice in the end. It is probably Mrs. Terrell will\ncommunicate with other members of the Constitution League with in, a\nfew days with a view of aiding the former soldiers.\"\n\nNothing happened during President Roosevelt's administration\nwhich stirred up the War Department to such a pitch as did the dismissal\nwithout honor of three companies of colored soldiers. Protests\nwere received from every part of the country against the injustice\nof punishing innocent men and soldiers with splendid records\nfor the misdeeds of a few, when no misdeed had been proved against\n\n-280-\n\neven the few. Many officers who dared not express their opinions\nopenly for fear of being court-martialed did not hesitate to say in\nprivate conversation that President Roosevelt's impetuosity \nhad caused him to make a serious blunder.\n\nThe tragedy which overtook the colored soldiers affected nobody\nmore than Brigadier Gereral A.S.

I was presented to hi\nhim one day in the office of Raymond Patterson, who was the special Washington\ncorrespondent of the Chicago Tribune and one of the General's\nbest friends. There was one story about the soldiers which the\nGeneral enjoyed relating more than anything else.\n\nWhen he was taking them to Spain during the Spanish-American\nWar he was asked several times by Southerners who came to the stations\nto see them, as they passed through the towns en route to Cuba, whether\n\"those niggers would really fight.\" When he told what he replied to\nthe generals face would flush bright red and he would jump quickly\nfrom his chair like a sixteen year old. \"Will those colored men\nfight?\" did you ask? Fight, did you say? Why they would charge into\nhell, fight their way out and drag the devil out by the tail.\" The\nGeneral was so afraid I might forget his exact words that he took\nthe pains to write them out on his card in his own hand and that\ncard is lying on my desk to day.\n\nGeneral Burt declared that the colored soldiers were the first\nto fight both in the Philippines and in Cuba.

At the last analysis, it will be\ndiscovered that there are just two causes of lynching. In the first place\nit is due to race hatred, the hatred of a stronger people toward a weaker\nwho were once held as slaves. In the second place, it is due to the lawlessness \nso prevalent in the section where nine-tenths of the lynchings occur. \nConsider the question of lynching from any point of view one may, and it is \nevident it is just as impossible for the colored people of this country \nto prevent mob violence by any attitude of mind which they may assume, or\nany course of conduct which they may pursue, as it is for a straw dam to \nstop Niagara's flow. Upon the same spirit of intolerance and of hatred the\ncrime of lynching must be fastened as that which called into being the Ku\nKlux Klan immediately after the Civil War, and which has prompted more \nrecent exhibitions of hostility toward the Colored-American, such as the\ndisenfranchisement acts, the Jim Crow Car Laws, the new slavery called, \"peonage\", \nthe rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan with a renewal of its wicked campaign \nagainst the persecuted race together with other acts of oppression which \nmake the lot of its representatives so hard.\n      Lynching is the aftermath of slavery. The white men who shoot colored \npeople to death and flay them alive, and the white women who apply flaming \ntorches to their oil-soaked bodies to day, are the sons and daughters of \nwomen who had but little, if any, compassion on the race when it was enslaved. \nThe men who lynch colored men to day are, as a rule, the children \nof women who sat by their firesides happy and proud in the possession and \naffection of their own children, while they looked with unpitying eye and \nadamantime heart upon the anguish of slave mothers whose children had been \nsold away, when not overtaken by a sadder fate. If it be contended, as it \noften is that colored people are rarely lynched by the descendants of former \nslaveholders, it will be difficult to prove the point. According to reports \nof lynching sent out by the Southern press itself, mobs are generally \ncomposed of the \"best citizens\" of the place, who quietly disperse to their \nhomes as soon as they are certain that the negro is good and dead. The \n\n\n\nnewspaper that predicted Sam Hose would be lynched, which offered a reward \nfor his capture and which suggested burning at the stake, was neither \nowned nor edited by the poor whites. But if it be conceded that the descendants \nof slaveholders do not burn and shoot colored people, lynching \nmust still be regarded as the legitimate offspring of slavery. If the \nchildren of the poor whites of the South are the chief aggressors in the \nlynching bees of that section, it is because their ancestors were brutalized \nby their slaveholding environment. In discussing the lynching of \ncolored people at the present time, the heredity and environment, past \nand present of white mobs are not taken sufficiently into account.\n        It is impossible to comprehend the cause of the ferocity and barbarity\nwhich attend the average lynching bee without taking into account the\nbrutalizing effect of slavery upon the people of the section where most\nof the lynchings occur, as it is to investigate the essence and nature of \nfire without considering the gases which cause the flame to ignite.\n       It is too much to expect, perhaps, that the children of women who for\ngenerations looked upon the hardships and degradation of their sisters of\na darker hue with few if any protests, should have mercy and compassion \nupon the children of that oppressed race now. But what a tremendous influence \nfor law and order, and what a mighty foe to mob violence Southern \nwhite women might be, if they would arise in the purity and power of \ntheir womanhood to implore their fathers, husbands and sons no longer to \nstain their hands with the black man's blood!\n        While the men of the South were off fighting to keep the colored\nAmerican in bondage, their mothers wives and daughters were entrusted to\nthe black man's care. How faithfully and loyally he kept his sacred trust\nthe records of history attest! Not a white woman was violated throughout \nthe entire war. Can the white women of the South forget how black men bore\nthemselves throughout that trying time? Surely it is not too much to\nask that the daughters of mothers who were shielded from harm by the black\nman's constancy and care should requite their former protectors, by at", "7", 174, 174, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00251", "-207-\nof my husband's cheerful outlook on life. He believed in looking\non the bright side of everything. It seemed never to occur to \nhim that any bad luck would overtake him, and, to tell the truth, \nit rarely did. But when we lost nearly everything we possessed, \nbecause he failed to take the proper precaution, it was the one\nexception which proved the rule. \nChapter 25\n-208-\nIn Berlin, Germany\nIt will surprise no one to have me frankly admit that the\nApril morning [ ] I received a letter from Berlin Germany inviting \nme to deliver an address at the International Congress of Women\nwhich would meet in Berlin in June was truly a red letter day in \nmy life.

It was like the\nthunderclap out of a clear sky--or better still like a beautiful\nrainbow which had not been preceded by rain. I wanted very \nmuch to accept the invitation, of course, But, how could I go?\nIn the first place, the financial aspect of the case had to \nbe considered--decidedly so! What about the money necessary to \nmake the trip? Where was it coming from? My husband's salary \nwas not very large and our living expenses were by no means small. \nBut, even if I could scrape together the money, how could I summon\ncourage enough to leave my family?--especially my small \ndaughter! But, like most difficulties which seem impossible to \nsmooth out when they first appear, those which confronted me\nthe morning I read that memorable letter soon dwindled in size \nand finally disappeared. Both my husband and my mother were\neager to have me go to Berlin. Mother could and would take care\nof my little daughter just as well as I could, she said, so there\nwas no reason in the world why I should decline such a wonderful\ninvitation. \nThen I wrote to my father about the matter and asked him to \ntell me what to do. Father was also eager to have me go and \npromised to send me $300 to help me finance the trip. Whenever\nmy courage seemed to be oozing away and the horror of leaving\nmy family seemed greater than I could endure, I would think of \nthe opportunity of presenting facts creditable to the colored\nwomen of the United States which had been miraculously afforded \nme and my spirits would immediately revive. \nAfter I had definitely decided to go abroad there was very", "5", 164, 164, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-002:00795", "MUNICIPAL COURT \nOF THE \nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\nJune 5, 1915\n\nMy dearest Wife: \nYou are now on your way to the \"Coast\" and \nI hope you are enjoying the trip, I only wish that I could be \nwith you, if it were not that I would, perhaps, be in the way \nwhile you are preparing your address.

There were nearly 3,000 people present. The American \nwomen (mostly Jane Addams, I think) decided to have me represent \nour delegation the first time the evening meeting was held in the \nChurch. That means, being interpreted that I represented the \nAmerican delegation the first time the evening meeting was to be \na very large one, because it was held in this magnificent old \nCathedral that looks as tho it were at least 500 years old. Up \nto Thursday night the evening meetings had been held in one of \nthe lecture rooms of the University and comparatively few could \nget in, but the people of Zurich were immensely interested in all \nof the meetings and filled every inch of the lecture room, many \nstanding up through the long session. But, now let me come to \nthe greatest night of my life. Miss Addams did not tell me until \nWednesday morning that I was to speak Thursday night. While I \nwas in Geneva I had had some thoughts of the Colored man's part \nin the war translated into French. I was under the impression \nthat the speeches during the Congress would be mainly in French, \nalthough, I knew of course, that Zurich is in German Switzerland.", "91", 176, 176, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-023:00511", "3\nacceptance of the unusual offer.  \"How kind you are to take so much\ntrouble.

And the unstinted praise scores of them have \nbestowed on me ever since that wonderful triumph! No matter \nwhere I turn the women and men too, rush upon me with words of \npraise and appreciation. They all say I speak by far the best \nGerman of any women in either the English or the American delegation, \nand believe me, the delegation from England is very, very strong, \nsimply full of intelligent, highly-educated women. When I enter a \nstore, the clerks even have something to say about the marvellous \nspeech I made and go into raptures over what they call my faultless \nGerman. The people who are buying in the store rush to shake my \nhand as soon as I appear. This is not an exaggeration. It is a \nplain statement of fact. I haven't begun to tell you the whole \nstory. Now what did I say? what do you who know me so well think I \nsaid? Well, I told the plain, unvarnished ugly truth in as strong \nGerman as the words in that language enabled me to set it forth. I \nwas just, I thanked the broad-minded white women of the United States \nfor inviting me to the Congress and said that all race-problems \nwould have long ago disappeared from the world, if people everywhere \nwould follow their example. I said it was my duty as well as a \ngreat pleasure to admit that many white people in the United \nStates help Colored people with money and in every way they can, and \nthen I went on for fifteen minutes and revealed to those foreigners \n\n\n(5)\nthe fearful injustices of every description perpetrated upon \nColored people in the United States among other things I said \n\"Die schwarzen und farbigen, die vonden vereinigten staaten nach \nFraukreich gingen kaiupten fur eins Freiheil die sie selbs nicht \nhaben!

I am sorry I did not have more time, for I am \nsure that I could have done even better than I did, but, viewed \nfrom the standpoint of the impression my speech made upon the \naudience, I am certain the effort could not possibly have been \nimproved. If I die tonight, I feel that, after the real tangible \nwork accomplished in behalf of freedom, justice and fair-play \nfor a handicapped persecuted race, Thursday night, May 15, I will \nnot have lived in vain. The German women wanted me to give them my \nspeech, so that it may appear in as many newspapers as possible in \nAustria and Germany. I am not going to tell them to print it, but \nI am going to comply with their request, and they can do as they \nplease. \nA woman from Denmark tried to express her horror at some of \nthe things I told her, but words [???led] her.

And Jane,\" added the maid, \"Mrs. Carroll told me\nI might go off this aftdrnoon.\"\n\n\"What on earth do Mrs. Finck want?\" soliloquized Jane. She\nwiped her hands and was tying on a clean white apron, when Mrs. von Finck\nappeared at the kitchen door. \"I came to go to the club with Mrs. Carroll,\nJane,\" she explained, ,\"but she has already gone.\" It has just occurred to\nme that this afternoon would be splendid time to make that delicious cake\nwhich Mrs. Carroll likes so much. It will be a delightful surprise to \nher.\" Mrs. von Finck's enthusiasm with reference to the pleasure which\nshe was sure of giving her mistress dissipated any reluctance [she] Jane [may] might\nhave entertained in accepting the offer.\n\nThe ingredients for the cake were assmebled quickly. \"While you\nare creaming the butter and sugar together, I believe I'll just run up\nstairs a few minutes to remove a hair pin which has been annoying me ever\nsince I left home. I'll probably have to take my hair down entirely,\nfor the hair pin can not be reached, unless I do. I've tried several times\nto remove it without going to all that trouble.\nBut I'll not be gone long.  Mrs. Carroll will have no objection, I am \nsure.\"  \"Deed she wont,\" assented Jane, as Mrs. von Finck hurried away.\n\nHaving creamed the butter and sugar, Jane [proceeded to put the] waited awhile before putting the\nother ingredients in the cake.  As she was [about] to beating the eggs,\nan unpleasant reference to Mrs. von Finck's being German which the butler\n\n7\nhad made flashed through her mind.  She stopped.  She did wish the lady up stairs would\nreturn, she thought.  After all she had been gone quite a while, come to think about\nit.  But it would not be polite to yell up stairs and call a visitor [lady] like\nMrs. von Finck, or even to go up stairs after her and thus appear to be\nhurrying a lady of her wealth and social position.\n\nThen she let the kitchen and entered the dining room.\n[As] she hesitated a minute, in doubt as to what it was best to do.\nBut the statement made by the butler kept ringing in her ears and urged her forward.  Quietly she stole\nup stairs.  Noiselessly she turned the knob and opened the door of Mr. Carroll's \nbedroom. [As] She glanced into the mirror of the dresser which reflected \nthe objects in her master's den.  \nShe saw Mrs. von Finck absorbed in some papers she held in her hand then crowd [crowding some papers] them in her \nknitting bag [and then] bend over the desk as she started to lock the top drawer from which \nthey had been extracted [and hide the little flat key under the paper \nweight.]  Quickly and quietly, Jane [slipped from the room] closed the door and rushed down the \nback stairs. What she has heard about spies [rushed through] pounded her brain with \ntremendous force. She knew something must be done to recover those precious papers, but she felt certain she could accomplish nothing herself.\nShe felt guilty, when she remembered how minutely she had described every\nthing in Mr. Carroll's room, told where his important papers were kept \nand where she hid the key. She fairly flew to the kitchen, determined that \nMrs. von Finck should not know she had left [the kitchen].  Intuitively she knew [realised] \nthat if Mrs. von Finck realized that she had been discovered, there would \nbe no chance of recovering those papers at all. She quickly resumed her \nwork and was stirring the cake vigorously, when Mrs. von Finck appeared \nin the door.  \"You done fixed your hair, Mrs. Finck\"? she inquired. \"Yes, Jane, and \nsince you understand exactly how to make the cake, [and it is getting late,]\nI'll go home. I thought I'd like to wait for Mrs. Carroll, but the cars \nare so uncertain and it is getting late. I left no word for Ruppert to \nbring the auto.

This \nmechanical genius was a slave, however, so his kind master secured the \npatent for the bridge in his own name and generously gave his ingenious \nslave a new violin as his share in the profits and as a suitable reward \nfor his skill. \nNothing is more interesting than to hear Mr. Watts, who owns one of the \nlargest coal yards in Washington relate some of the amusing incidents \nwhich occurred, when he started in business for himself twenty five \nyears ago. Unable either to read or write, when his creditors presented \nhim the bills, he says, he simply drew forth the amount of cash which \nseemd to him sufficient to liquidate the debt and allowed them to help \nthemselves. He insists that the men with whom he traded were invariably \nhonest and he refuses to believe that anybody ever cheated him out of a \ncent. There are at least thirty Colored tailors in Washington.

When one thikns\nof the efforts exerted and the money expended in the Colored-American's\nbehalf, it is but natural that he should inquire whether the recipient of \nso many favors has proved himself worthy of them or not. As a beneficiary\ncan the Colored-American pass muster, or does he fail?\nInvestigate the Colored-American's progress in any field of human\nendeavor you may. See the brilliant success he has achieved in the best \nuniversities of this land. Investigate his progress in finance and trade,\nso far as he has been able to go. Recall the many proffs he has given of\nthe highest, purest patriotism. Behold on all sides example of irreproachable\ncitizenship unto which thousands of Colored people have attained, and\nsurely, no honest person will claim that the sacrifices made and the\nmoney expended in the Colored-American's behalf are all in vain. \nWhen the victorious Union soldiers marched up Pennsylvania Avenue\nfifty years ago, as a race the Colored-American could not read. Today\nthere are in the race poets, novelists concerning whose genius and\nsuccess the most distinguished litterateurs of this country are glad to \ntestify. When Fort Sumter was fired upon by rebel guns in a large section\nof this county it was practically a crime to teach Colored children to\nread. To day there are at least 2,000,000 of our children in the public \nschools, while 90,000 of our youth are in the various institutions of the\ncountry, pursuing classical, scientific and business courses, while many\nare learning the trades. In the arts - in music, sculpture and painting, \nwe have achieved signal success. There was in the Luxembourg Gallery of Paris hanging only a few years ago one of the finest painting of modern times, which had been purchased\nby the government of France. It was the work of a young Colored-American,\nand was awarded the first prize over innumerable others, painted by picked \nartists from all over the world. When Abraham Lincoln reviewed the\nUnion soldiers returning from the War, Colored people were practically\n\n\n\n\n4\npenniless - ignorant, poor, with no place to lay their heads. According to\nthe estimate of some slaves and their descendants are worth from 700 to\n$800,000,000 to day. Other facts which redound just as much to the Colored-American's \ncredit might easily be given, if there were sufficient time. But with such a magnificent record of progress, surely there is not a member of the Women's Relief Corps, nor a soldier in the G.A.R who feels that the efforts exerted in the Colored-Americans behalf have been\nof no avail. \nBut, frankly speaking, some of us are greatly alarmed at certain conditions which confront the Colored-Americans to day. But, we are not sitting supinely by with folded hands, drooping heads and weeping eyes. But some of us are doing everything we can to improve these untoward conditions under which we are obliged to live. Fr, we believe that if we work hard, agitate continuously and fight courageously the monsters of oppression and race-prejudice wherever and whenever they rear their ugly heads, right and justice must eventually prevail.\nAnd, now, as we gaze with fond eyes and grateful hearts upon our country's emblem, so kindly presented us by the Women's Relief Corps, let us all hope that the day will soon dawn, when the lofty ideals and the noble sentiments for which the American flag really stands will be so woven into the woof and warf of the nation, that the principles of liberty, justice, equality of opportunity and equality before the law upon which this country was founded, in which all loyal, American citizens are supposed to believe will so take hold of the heart of the American people as a whole that no human being in the United States, whether woman\nor man - child or adult - Jew or Gentile, black or which shall be, ade the helpless victim of oppression, prejudice or wrong.", "3", 181, 181, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-021:00688", "Shall We Think?\n Mary Church Terrell.

This is not an appeal\nto anybody to take a college course, even though it has all the ear marks\nthereof.  I take it for granted that every young person who is likely to\nread this article knows full well that in this day and time it is almost\nimpossible to achieve anything worth while without a college education.\nThe older the world grows, the more determined it is to allow nobody who\nhas not a well trained mind to succeed along any line.\n        A few years ago it was [im]possible to take a course in medicine or\nlaw at the best schools in the country with comparitively little preparation.\nBut to day nobody is allowed to study either one of these professions\nwho has not had a college education or the equivalent thereof.\n        In this message to young people which Professor Brawley has so kindly\ninvited me to send I shall try to confine myself to a single request.\nOf course, it would be possible to make several, but I shall have mercy\non my young readers and limit myself.\n         But before I start \"requesting\" I want to state why it is so hard for me\nto obey the tenth commandment, when I think of young people who are in\ncollege.  If there is anything in the world more intriguing, and more thrilling \nthan the effort properly to prepare one's self for his life work, I\ndo not know what it is.  Nearly everybody enjoys taking a journey.  One\nthinks about it and plans for it a long time ahead.  It is said that the\naverage human being is happier, while he is preparing for the journey, than\nhe is after he reaches his destination.  But that is a matter of temperament.\nEverybody knows that he can not enjoy a journey, unless he makes\nthe necessary arrangements.\n        Well, pursuing a college course is getting ready to go somewhere--\nsome place we want very much to reach; to do something worth while and to\nbe somebody.  That certainly is enough to enthuse, inspire, and challenge\n\n                                                            2\nthe most phlegmatic person in the world.  Of course completing a college\ncourse is like everything else worth accomplishing.  It means work and a\nlot of it.  Truth compels me to admit that it isn't as \"easy as falling\noff a log,\" or going to a circus or attending a movie and watching a continuous \nperformance. But, considering what a solid foundation it is possible \nto lay for any kind of superstructure which one wishes to erect, completing \na college course is worth any sacrifice which it is necessary for\nyoung people to make.\n          It is not only the facts which one acquires in science or in any other\nfield of learning that makes a college education almost a necessity for\nservice or achievement of any kind, but it is what a student receives in\naddition to the instruction given in the class room- it is what he gets\n\"on the side\" that aids so much in rounding out and enriching his young life.\nTaking a college course is like entering upon a great adventure with a\nfuture full of promise beckoning the student on,  There is no telling\nwhat [great] desirable and wonderful thing may happen, if the student plays her or\nhis part well and quits herself or himself like a woman or a man.\n        It is precisely this aspect of college life which appeals so strongly\nto me, which makes me wish I were going to college this very minute\nand which forces me to remind myself continually of the tenth commandment \nand say quite sternly \"Thou shalt not envy young people their college \ncourse.\" There were never so many things which needed to be done in\nthe world as there are at the present time.  And there were never so many\nopportunities offered to people who are properly prepared to do them as there are \nto day.\n           And now let me make my appeal.  While you are in college I want to urge\nyou to learn to think.  For years it has been borne in upon me more and\nmore that there is nothong which handicaps the individual and impedes the\nprogress of the world more than the average human being's failure to think.\nThere are people who are really \"talented\", as we express it, and who\nmight achieve distinction, who might serve their day and generation well,\nwho never rise higher than mediocrity, because they seem to put their\nbrains in a tight box and never give them any air.\n      This is nothing new to you. Every day of their lives students are urged by their instructors \nto think.  But I am daring to call your attention to it once more, because \nsometimes, when a comparative stranger makes a request, it arrests our\nattention more than it does when it comes from those with whom we are\nconstantly associated.", "2", 182, 182, "service:mss:mss42549:mss42549-026:00200", "109\nletter from the firm stating that her references were the most satisfactory\n that had been submitted and requesting her to call.\n\nWhen she presented herself there was some doubt in the mind of the \nman to whom she was directed concerning her racial pedigree, so he asked \nher point blank whether she was colored or white. When she confessed the \ntruth the merchant expressed great sorrow and deep regret that he could \nnot avail himself of the services of so competent a person. He frankly \nadmitted that employing a colored woman in his establishment in any except \na menial position was simply out of the question.\n\nOne of my daughters had a similar experience. She answered an advertisement \nand was appointed a clerk in the credit department of a large \ndepartment store where we had traded for years. Her father had often assisted \nthe head of the firm by advising him gratuitously concerning matters \nwhich the latter did not care to take into the courts. Without the knowledge \nof either one of us she secured this position on her merit. But she \nhad been employed less than a week before she was called to the office of \nthe manager and questioned concerning her race. An employe of the store \nwho was well acquainted with our family had reported that a colored girl \nwas working in the credit department and had told who she was. Then my \nyoung daughter promptly lost her job. Naturally it shook me to the very \nfoundation of my being to see her the victim of such cruel race prejudice, \nbut I was helpless to shield her from the embarrassment and humiliation \nto which she had been subjected.\n\nIn order to get a good job one of my young friends left Washington \nand went to New York. There she worked her way up in one of the largest \ndry good stores till she was placed as a saleswoman in the cloak department. \nTired of being separated from her family she decided to return to \nWashington,feeling sure that, with her experience and her fine recommendations \nfrom the New York firm,she could easily secure employment. Nor was \nshe overconfident ,for the proprietor of one of the largest dry goods \nstore in her native city was glad to secure the services of a young woman \nwho had brought such glowing credentials from New York.\n\nShe had not been in this store very long,however, before she called \nupon me one day and asked me to intercede with the proprietor in her \nbehalf. She had just been discharged that afternoon because it had been \ndiscovered that she was colored. When I called upon my young friend's employer \nhe made no effort to avoid the issue, as I had feared he would. \n\n110\nHe did not say that he had discharged the your woman because she had not \ngiven satisfaction, as he might easily have done. On the contrary, he admitted \nwithout the slightest hesitation that the young woman he had just \ndischarged one of the best clerks he had ever had. In the cloak department \nwhere he had been assigned, she had been a brilliant success,he \nsaid.\n\n\" But I cannot keep Miss. Smith in my employ,\" he concluded. \" Are \nyou not master of your own store?\" I ventured to enquire. The proprietor \nof the store was a Jew,and I felt it was particularly cruel, unnatural \nand cold-blooded for the representative of one oppressed and persecuted \nrace to deal so harshly and unjustly with a member of another. I had intended \nto make this point when I decided to intercede for my young friend, \nbut when I thought how a reference to the persecution of his own race \nwould wound his feelings,the words froze on my lips. \n\n\" When I first heard your friend was colored,\" he explained, \"I \ndid not believe it and said so to the clerks who made the statement. \nFinally the girls who had been most pronounced in their opposition to \nworking in a store with a colored girl came to me in a body and threatened \nto strike. Strike away, I told them, your places can easily be filled. \nThen they started on another tack. Delegation after delegation began to \nfile down to my office, and some of the women were my very best customers, \nto protest against my employing a colored girl. Moreover, they threatened \nto boycott my store if I did not discharge her at once. Then it became a \nquestion of bread and butter with me and I yielded to the inevitable, that's \nall. Now,\" he said, concluding, \"if I lived in a great cosmopolitan city \nlike New York, I should do as I pleased, and refuse to discharge a girl \nsimply because she was colored.\"\n\nThat recalled to my mind a similar incident that happened in \nNew York. I remembered that a colored woman, as fair as a lily and as \nbeautiful as Madonna, who was the head saleswoman in a large department \nstore in New York, had been discharged, after she had held this position \nfor years, when the proprietor accidentally discovered that a fatal drop of \nAfrican blood was percolating through her veins.\n\nI can secure no employment in the Washington stores except as a \nmenial.
