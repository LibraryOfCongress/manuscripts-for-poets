    <h1>A Moonlight Excusion</h1>

    <p>The following is an erasure poem written by Ide Amari Thompson as a part of his 2023 <a href="https://www.loc.gov/programs/of-the-people/learn/archives-history-and-heritage-advanced-internship/">AHHA internship</a> with the Library's <a href="https://www.loc.gov/programs/of-the-people/represent/connecting-communities-digital-initiative/">Connecting Communities Digital Initiative (CCDI)</a>. The poem is provided as an image and three different transcripts: the original text, the poem with redactions, and poem without redactions. The poem is based on an early writing by Mary Church Terrell circa 1876 called <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/mss42549.mss42549-020_00098_00113/?sp=11&st=text">“A Moonlight Excursion”</a>.</p>

      A Moonlight Excursion.<br />
      We had looked forward to this excursion<br />
      with a great deal of delight, for it is delight<br />
      ful certainly to take a trip on the ocean by<br />
      daylight, but to take a trip by moonlight<br />
      we could not conceive of. We went to our<br />
      landing and started at nine oclock P.M.<br />
      It was a grand moonlight evening, and<br />
      everything was as bright as day. Just<br />
      before the boat made her landing the<br />
      fireworks began and of course made the boat<br />
      like some large ball of pink fire. As we<br />
      went sailing along, everthing was on the<br />
      boat to make it pleasant. Just before<br />
      we passed Coney Island the bell was<br />
      rung, and as we looked over we saw<br />
      that it was all illuminated and fire works<br />
      were in progress, so it was with all the<br />
      watering places, and the beauty of the<br />
      scene must be left for others immaginations<br />
      for it can be better immagined than descrided.<br />
      We had a delightful trip,<br />
      for the music and dancing was<br />
      [New Page]<br />
      certainly enough to enliven one. We arrived<br />
      in New York at one oclock A.M. We were<br />
      on the same elegant Steamer the Grand<br />
      Republic. All the boats are generally crowded<br />
      and the evening we returned from Seaside<br />
      we saw about fifty boats crowded some just<br />
      starting out and others coming in.
