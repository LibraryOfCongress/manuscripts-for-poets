<pre>
A Moonlight Excursion.
We had looked forward to this excursion
with a great deal of delight, for it is delight
ful certainly to take a trip on the ocean by
daylight, but to take a trip by moonlight
we could not conceive of. We went to our
landing and started at nine oclock P.M.
It was a grand moonlight evening, and
everything was as bright as day. Just
before the boat made her landing the
fireworks began and of course made the boat
like some large ball of pink fire. As we
went sailing along, everthing was on the
boat to make it pleasant. Just before
we passed Coney Island the bell was
rung, and as we looked over we saw
that it was all illuminated and fire works
were in progress, so it was with all the
watering places, and the beauty of the
scene must be left for others immaginations
for it can be better immagined than descrided.
We had a delightful trip,
for the music and dancing was
[New Page]
certainly enough to enliven one. We arrived
in New York at one oclock A.M. We were
on the same elegant Steamer the Grand
Republic. All the boats are generally crowded
and the evening we returned from Seaside
we saw about fifty boats crowded some just
starting out and others coming in.
