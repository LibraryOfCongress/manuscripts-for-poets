# Manuscripts for Poets

A repository containing experimental interfaces for using the [Library's manuscript digital collections](https://www.loc.gov/manuscripts/collections/) and [By The People (BtP)](https://crowd.loc.gov/) [transcript data](https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=contributor:by+the+people+%28program%29) to support the creative process for artists, writers, and poets.

## Interfaces

### At the Table With: Mary Church Terrell

[At the Table](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/manuscripts-for-poets/at-the-table/) is an interactive art project and interface to support creatives, writers, and poets during the generative process of creative writing. This is done by asking you to directly engage with the words of civil rights activist and suffragist [Mary Church Terrell (1863-1954)](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/manuscripts-for-poets/at-the-table/). Thousands of creative prompts (i.e. questions and instructions) were generated by analyzing Terrell's writing from thousands of documents consisting of her diaries, letters, speeches, publications, and poetry. This interface aims to treat the [Mary Church Terrell Papers](https://www.loc.gov/collections/mary-church-terrell-papers/about-this-collection/) not as a static collection of documents, but a vibrant and dynamic repository that leaves you with a renewed sense of the possibilities of words and their power to create effective change.

This project was created by the Library of Congress 2023 [AHHA interns](https://www.loc.gov/programs/of-the-people/learn/archives-history-and-heritage-advanced-internship/), Ide Amari Thompson and Madeline Toombs, as part of the [Connecting Communities Digital Initiative (CCDI)](https://www.loc.gov/programs/of-the-people/represent/connecting-communities-digital-initiative/).
